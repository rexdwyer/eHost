>>>section: methods
Materials and Methods
Animals
Six-week-old male prediabetic ZDF and Zucker lean (ZL) rats (Ge-
netic Models, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were provided rat chow, PMI 
Lab-Diet 5001 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO), and water ad libitum. The
obese and lean rats were divided into three subgroups (n
6 per
subgroup): DZ (DZ-ZDF), pair-fed (PF-ZDF), and control (C-ZDF). DZ
[150 mg/kg body weightd; Proglycem suspension 50 mg/ml (Baker-
Norton Pharmaceuticals, Miami, FL)] or an equivalent volume of vehicle
(to PF-ZDF and C-ZDF) was administered by gavage needle twice daily
for a period of 8 wk.
Metabolic and biochemical studies
Rats were weighed twice weekly, and food consumption was 
measured in separate metabolic cages during the 2nd and 6th wk of the
study. Blood samples from tail vein were obtained for analysis of glucose
after an 18-hour fast once weekly. When animals were fasted, doses of
DZ or vehicle were withheld for at least 18 h. At the end of the 8-wk
period, ip glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs; 1.0 g glucose/kg body
weight) were performed after an overnight fast (18 h). Blood for glucose
and insulin was drawn into heparinized tubes from the supraorbital
sinus 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after glucose administration under anesthesia
by im ketamine (65-100 mg/kg body weight). On a separate day, fasting
blood samples were obtained for glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin/
adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa (ACRP30), FFAs, TGs,
and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Pancreatic islet studies
After an overnight fast (18 h), a pancreatic islet isolation procedure
was performed between 0900 and 1100 h. Rats were anesthetized by im
injections of Nembutal (50 mg/kg) and ketamine (90 mg/kg). Pancreatic
islets were isolated as previously described by Naber et al. (23). The
pancreatic tissue was digested in collagenase buffer mix, and islets were
separated from acinar tissue on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient. The
RNA extraction was performed from freshly isolated islets in PBS (see
below). Also, groups of 100-300 islets were immediately frozen in 
meth-anol-dry ice and stored at 80 C until used for TG, insulin, and AC
assays. The animals were then euthanized by a terminal cardiac 
puncture and exsanguinations, omental adipose tissue was also harvested for
RNA extraction, and the remainder was stored in 80 C. The Medical
College of Wisconsin Animal Resource Center approved the animal
procedures.
Assays
Plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin/ACRP30. Glucose level was
measured by the glucose oxidase method (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO). Plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, and adiponectin

Endocrinology, December 2004, 145(12):5476-5484 5477
were determined by RIA kits using a double-antibody method (LINCO
Research, St. Louis, MO).
Plasma TGs and FFAs. Plasma TG level was measured by an enzymatic
method (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO). Plasma FFA was 
determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals, 
Richmond, VA).
Hemoglobin A1c. Glycosylated HbA1c was measured using the DCA 2000
latex immunoagglutination method (Bayer, Tarrytown, CA).
Extraction of total RNA and multiple real-time RT-PCR quantitation. Total
RNA was extracted by the TRIzol isolation method (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD). The RNA yield from isolated pancreatic islets
(300-500) was 12-20 Ä±`g per ZL and ZDF rat. RNA was treated with
ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease (Promega, Madison, WI) and
stored in Ambion RNA storage solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) at80 C.
First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 Ä±`g RNA in a 10-l solution
containing 200 U Superscript II (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA), 1 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix, 2 U Rnasin (Promega,
Madison, WI), 2.5 m random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5
first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), and diethylpyrocarbonate water. After
incubation for 1 h at 42 C, the reaction mixture was heated to 94 C for
2 min. The cDNA was then stored at 20 C.
PCR amplification and analysis was performed using a Smartcycler
II instrument and software version 1.2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) (24).
The final reaction mix of 25 l consisted of 2 l cDNA, 0.5 m each
primer, 12.5 l QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA), and 8.0 l H2O. For all primer pairs except 18S RNA (internal
control), the cDNA was denatured by incubation at 95 C for 10 min. The
template was amplified for 55 cycles of 30 sec at 95 C, 40 sec at 60 C, and
30 sec at 72 C. The 18S RNA primer pair was incubated at 95 C for 10
min; the template was then amplified for 65 cycles of 30 sec at 95 C, 40
sec at 55 C, and 30 sec at 72 C. Fluorescent data were acquired during
each extension phase. A standard curve was created for each primer set
using a serial dilution series of 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, and 1:625 using control
sample cDNA. All samples and standard curve dilutions were run in
duplicate. After all cycles were complete, a melting curve was generated
by cooling samples to 60 C and slowly heating the samples at 0.2 C/sec
to 95 C. Cycle threshold is defined as the first cycle in which there is
significant increase in fluorescence above the background, which 
correlates to the log-linear phase of PCR amplification. Cycle threshold
values were used to calculate relative amount values in samples.
Table 1 summarizes the sequences of the primers, 3-adrenergic 
receptor (3AR), FAS, acyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), uncoupling
protein-2 (UCP-2), and insulin, which were used to amplify first-strand
cDNA for gene products. The products were run on 1% agarose gel for
confirmation. 18S rRNA (Quantum-RNA kit; Ambion) was used as an
internal control, and levels of FAS, ACC, UCP-2, 3AR, and insulin
mRNA were expressed as the ratio for gene mRNA relative to 18S
mRNA. All primers were obtained from Integrated Technologies (Cor-
alville, IA).
Islet TG content. Fifty to 100 islet homogenates were prepared as 
previously described by Danno et al. (25). The homogenates underwent
chloroform/methanol extraction before TG measurement. 
Measurements were made in duplicate using the Sigma (GPO-Trinder) kit as
previously described (7).
Islet insulin content. For measurement of islet insulin content, 10 islets in
0.5 ml PBS were sonicated three times for 15 sec, and then the 
homog-enate underwent acid extraction before determination of insulin content,
5478 Endocrinology, December 2004, 145(12):5476-5484
as previously described (11). Insulin content was determined by using
a double-antibody RIA with rat standards (LINCO Research, St. Louis,
MO).
Islet AC activity in islets and adipose tissue.Before the assay, the 10-50 islets
were homogenized in a medium consisting of 0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm
Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Adipose tissues were minced and plasma 
membranes were prepared as previously described (26). The enzyme activity
was assayed using a bioluminescent assay for AC activity, which was
expressed as cAMP (picomoles per minute per milligram of protein) (27).
Protein content of islet and adipose tissue fractions was estimated using
the Lowry method (28).
Statistical analysis
The reported values represent the mean se. Statistical comparisons
between subgroups were assessed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnettâ€™s
and Tukeyâ€™s tests. P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Modulation of Adipoinsular Axis in Prediabetic Zucker
Diabetic Fatty Rats by Diazoxide
RAMIN ALEMZADEH AND KATHRYN M. TUSHAUS
Department of Pediatrics, Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin
53226
Dysregulation of the adipoinsular axis in male obese Zucker
diabetic fatty (ZDF; fa/fa) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes,
results in chronic hyperinsulinemia and increased de novo
lipogenesis in islets, leading to -cell failure and diabetes.
Diazoxide (DZ; 150 mg/kgd), an inhibitor of insulin secretion,
was administered to prediabetic ZDF animals for 8 wk as a
strategy for prevention of diabetes. DZ reduced food intake
(P < 0.02) and rate of weight gain only in ZDF rats (P < 0.01).
Plasma insulin response to glucose load was attenuated in
DZ-Zucker lean rats (ZL; P < 0.01), whereas DZ-ZDF had
higher insulin response to glucose than controls (P < 0.001).
DZ improvedhemoglobinA1c (P< 0.001) andglucose tolerance
in ZDF (P< 0.001), but deteriorated hemoglobin A1c in ZL rats
(P < 0.02) despite normal tolerance in the fasted state. DZ
lowered plasma leptin (P < 0.001), free fatty acid, and 
triglyceride (P < 0.001) levels, but increased adiponectin levels (P <

0.02) only in ZDF rats. DZ enhanced 3-adrenoreceptormRNA
(P< 0.005) and adenylate cyclase activity (P< 0.01) in adipose
tissue from ZDF rats only, whereas it enhanced islet 3-
adrenergic receptor mRNA (P < 0.005) but paradoxically 
decreased islet adenylate cyclase activity (P < 0.005) in these
animals. Islet fatty acid synthase mRNA (P < 0.03), acyl 
coenzyme A carboxylase mRNA (P< 0.01), uncoupling protein-2
mRNA (P < 0.01), and triglyceride content (P < 0.005) were
only decreased in DZ-ZDF rats, whereas islet insulin mRNA
and insulin content were increased in DZ-ZDF (P < 0.01) and
DZ-ZL rats (P < 0.03). DZ-induced -cell rest improved the
lipid profile, enhanced themetabolic efficiency of insulin, and
prevented -cell dysfunction and diabetes in diabetes-prone
animals. This therapeutic strategy may be beneficial in 
preventing -cell failure and progression to diabetes in humans.
(Endocrinology 145: 5476-5484, 2004)
TYPE 2 DIABETES mellitus (DM) has become the
complication of obesity worldwide (1). Obesemostcommon
humans and experimental animals characteristically 
manifest hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and 
hyperlipid-emia, which predispose to glucose intolerance and diabetes
(2). Dysregulation of the adipoinsular axis in obese 
individuals due to defective leptin, an Ob gene product, reception
by -cells, is believed to result in chronic hyperinsulinemia
and may contribute to the pathogenesis of adipogenic 
diabetes (2). Similarly, the inability of leptin to suppress insulin
secretion in leptin-insensitive pancreatic islets of male obese
Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF fa/fa) male rats, a model of type
2 DM, results in chronic hyperinsulinemia and increased de
novo lipogenesis in pancreatic islets (3, 4). Enhanced activity
of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a key insulin-sensitive enzyme
regulating lipogenesis, and overaccumulation of fat in 
pancreatic islets of obese ZDF rats cause -cell failure with a
predictable progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic
state (5).
There is abundant evidence linking high plasma free fatty
acid (FFA) levels of obesity to the increased risk of type 2 DM

3 and 8 wk of age and become overtly diabetic usually

of hyperglycemia (4) is associated with a 10-fold increase in
islet triglyceride (TG) content, which coincides with the onset
of islet dysfunction and overt diabetes (7). High tissue levels
of fatty acyl coenzyme A interfere with glucose metabolism,
not only in skeletal muscle (9), where they play an important
role in insulin resistance (10), but also in -cells, where they
may cause the secretory dysfunction that characterizes type
2 DM (11). Over time, hyperglycemia worsens, a 
phenomenon that has been attributed to the deleterious effect of
chronic hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) (12, 13) or chronic 
hy-perlipidemia (lipotoxicity) (14, 15) on -cell function, and is
often accompanied by increased TG content and decreased
insulin gene expression (16, 17). A leptin receptor mutation
in ZDF rats is believed to interfere with leptinâ€™s modulation
of islet
its antisteatotic effect with 
result-KATP channel and
ant chronic hyperinsulinemia and islet cell lipotoxicity,
which lead to -cell failure and diabetes (4, 18). Attenuation
of insulin release by
KATP channel openers like diazoxide
(DZ) (19) can improve the insulin release pattern in both
human and animal models of type 2 DM. This effect is likely
mediated via hyperpolarization of -cells, thereby providing
-cell rest by reducing insulin release (20, 21). Chronic 
suppression of hyperinsulinemia in mildly hyperglycemic obese
Zucker (fa/fa) rats by DZ also reduces plasma FFA, TG, and
leptin levels and down-regulates adipose tissue, FAS 
activity, and lipoprotein lipase mRNA (22). To assess the

bolic effects of DZ-induced -cell rest in prediabetic ZDF, as
a strategy for prevention of diabetes in prediabetic ZDF rats,
we measured insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, lipid 
profile, 3-adrenoreceptor (3-AR) gene expression, and 
adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in pancreatic islets and adipose
tissue and expression of liporegulatory genes and insulin
gene expression in islets.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Six-week-old male prediabetic ZDF and Zucker lean (ZL) rats (Ge-
netic Models, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were provided rat chow, PMI 
Lab-Diet 5001 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO), and water ad libitum. The
obese and lean rats were divided into three subgroups (n
6 per
subgroup): DZ (DZ-ZDF), pair-fed (PF-ZDF), and control (C-ZDF). DZ
[150 mg/kg body weightd; Proglycem suspension 50 mg/ml (Baker-
Norton Pharmaceuticals, Miami, FL)] or an equivalent volume of vehicle
(to PF-ZDF and C-ZDF) was administered by gavage needle twice daily
for a period of 8 wk.
Metabolic and biochemical studies
Rats were weighed twice weekly, and food consumption was 
measured in separate metabolic cages during the 2nd and 6th wk of the
study. Blood samples from tail vein were obtained for analysis of glucose
after an 18-hour fast once weekly. When animals were fasted, doses of
DZ or vehicle were withheld for at least 18 h. At the end of the 8-wk
period, ip glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs; 1.0 g glucose/kg body
weight) were performed after an overnight fast (18 h). Blood for glucose
and insulin was drawn into heparinized tubes from the supraorbital
sinus 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after glucose administration under anesthesia
by im ketamine (65-100 mg/kg body weight). On a separate day, fasting
blood samples were obtained for glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin/
adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa (ACRP30), FFAs, TGs,
and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Pancreatic islet studies
After an overnight fast (18 h), a pancreatic islet isolation procedure
was performed between 0900 and 1100 h. Rats were anesthetized by im
injections of Nembutal (50 mg/kg) and ketamine (90 mg/kg). Pancreatic
islets were isolated as previously described by Naber et al. (23). The
pancreatic tissue was digested in collagenase buffer mix, and islets were
separated from acinar tissue on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient. The
RNA extraction was performed from freshly isolated islets in PBS (see
below). Also, groups of 100-300 islets were immediately frozen in 
meth-anol-dry ice and stored at 80 C until used for TG, insulin, and AC
assays. The animals were then euthanized by a terminal cardiac 
puncture and exsanguinations, omental adipose tissue was also harvested for
RNA extraction, and the remainder was stored in 80 C. The Medical
College of Wisconsin Animal Resource Center approved the animal
procedures.
Assays
Plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin/ACRP30. Glucose level was
measured by the glucose oxidase method (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO). Plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, and adiponectin

were determined by RIA kits using a double-antibody method (LINCO
Research, St. Louis, MO).
Plasma TGs and FFAs. Plasma TG level was measured by an enzymatic
method (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO). Plasma FFA was 
determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals, 
Richmond, VA).
Hemoglobin A1c. Glycosylated HbA1c was measured using the DCA 2000
latex immunoagglutination method (Bayer, Tarrytown, CA).
Extraction of total RNA and multiple real-time RT-PCR quantitation. Total
RNA was extracted by the TRIzol isolation method (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD). The RNA yield from isolated pancreatic islets
(300-500) was 12-20 Ä±`g per ZL and ZDF rat. RNA was treated with
ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease (Promega, Madison, WI) and
stored in Ambion RNA storage solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) at80 C.
First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 Ä±`g RNA in a 10-l solution
containing 200 U Superscript II (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA), 1 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix, 2 U Rnasin (Promega,
Madison, WI), 2.5 m random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5
first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), and diethylpyrocarbonate water. After
incubation for 1 h at 42 C, the reaction mixture was heated to 94 C for
2 min. The cDNA was then stored at 20 C.
PCR amplification and analysis was performed using a Smartcycler
II instrument and software version 1.2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) (24).
The final reaction mix of 25 l consisted of 2 l cDNA, 0.5 m each
primer, 12.5 l QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA), and 8.0 l H2O. For all primer pairs except 18S RNA (internal
control), the cDNA was denatured by incubation at 95 C for 10 min. The
template was amplified for 55 cycles of 30 sec at 95 C, 40 sec at 60 C, and
30 sec at 72 C. The 18S RNA primer pair was incubated at 95 C for 10
min; the template was then amplified for 65 cycles of 30 sec at 95 C, 40
sec at 55 C, and 30 sec at 72 C. Fluorescent data were acquired during
each extension phase. A standard curve was created for each primer set
using a serial dilution series of 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, and 1:625 using control
sample cDNA. All samples and standard curve dilutions were run in
duplicate. After all cycles were complete, a melting curve was generated
by cooling samples to 60 C and slowly heating the samples at 0.2 C/sec
to 95 C. Cycle threshold is defined as the first cycle in which there is
significant increase in fluorescence above the background, which 
correlates to the log-linear phase of PCR amplification. Cycle threshold
values were used to calculate relative amount values in samples.
Table 1 summarizes the sequences of the primers, 3-adrenergic 
receptor (3AR), FAS, acyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), uncoupling
protein-2 (UCP-2), and insulin, which were used to amplify first-strand
cDNA for gene products. The products were run on 1% agarose gel for
confirmation. 18S rRNA (Quantum-RNA kit; Ambion) was used as an
internal control, and levels of FAS, ACC, UCP-2, 3AR, and insulin
mRNA were expressed as the ratio for gene mRNA relative to 18S
mRNA. All primers were obtained from Integrated Technologies (Cor-
alville, IA).
Islet TG content. Fifty to 100 islet homogenates were prepared as 
previously described by Danno et al. (25). The homogenates underwent
chloroform/methanol extraction before TG measurement. 
Measurements were made in duplicate using the Sigma (GPO-Trinder) kit as
previously described (7).
Islet insulin content. For measurement of islet insulin content, 10 islets in
0.5 ml PBS were sonicated three times for 15 sec, and then the 
homog-enate underwent acid extraction before determination of insulin content,
5478 Endocrinology, December 2004, 145(12):5476-5484
as previously described (11). Insulin content was determined by using
a double-antibody RIA with rat standards (LINCO Research, St. Louis,
MO).
Islet AC activity in islets and adipose tissue.Before the assay, the 10-50 islets
were homogenized in a medium consisting of 0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm
Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Adipose tissues were minced and plasma 
membranes were prepared as previously described (26). The enzyme activity
was assayed using a bioluminescent assay for AC activity, which was
expressed as cAMP (picomoles per minute per milligram of protein) (27).
Protein content of islet and adipose tissue fractions was estimated using
the Lowry method (28).
Statistical analysis
The reported values represent the mean se. Statistical comparisons
between subgroups were assessed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnettâ€™s
and Tukeyâ€™s tests. P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Effect of DZ on food intake and body weight
Table 2 shows weight and food intake in ZDF and ZL rats.
C-ZDF rats exhibited higher initial weight and greater
weight gain over the 8-wk period than ZL animals (P
0.001). The final body weight and average weight gain in
DZ-ZDF animals were reduced compared with PF-ZDF (P
0.02) and C-ZDF rats (P 0.001), respectively. Also, PF-ZDF
rats had lower final weight (P 0.02) and rate of weight gain
(P  0.02) than C-ZDF animals. Body weight differences
between DZ-ZDF and C-ZDF (P  0.02) and PF-ZDF and
C-ZDF (P  0.02) first emerged at ages 8 and 9 wk, 
respectively (data not shown). Body weight differences between
DZ-ZDF and PF-ZDF (P 0.02) were first observed at 13 wk
of age. DZ treatment did not affect body weight in ZL rats.
When food intake was measured during the treatment period
(2nd and 6th wk), C-ZDF rats consumed larger amounts of
food than C-ZL animals (P  0.001). DZ treatment reduced
food intake in ZDF rats compared with PF-ZDF (P  0.02)
and C-ZDF rats (P 0.001) without a significant effect in ZL
animals.

plasma glucose concentrations than C-ZDF and PF-ZDF rats
(P  0.0001) at the completion of the study. Fasting plasma
glucose differences between DZ-ZDF and C-ZDF (P 0.005)
initially appeared at age 8 wk. Also, PF-ZDF had lower
fasting plasma glucose levels than C-ZDF (P  0.02) during
the last 2 wk of the study.
Table 3 shows fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin,
leptin, adiponectin, FFAs, and TG, after 8 wk of DZ or vehicle
treatment. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin 
concentrations were higher among ZDF animals compared with ZL
rats (P  0.001). Fasting plasma glucose was lower in 
DZ-ZDF compared with PF-ZDF (P  0.002) and C-ZDF (P

plasma insulin levels than C-ZDF rats (P  0.01).
Fasting plasma leptin levels were higher in ZDF than in ZL
animals (P 0.001). Although DZ treatment reduced plasma
leptin in ZDF animals (P 0.001), it did not affect leptin level
in ZL rats. Furthermore, ZL animals showed higher fasting
plasma adiponectin levels than ZDF rats (P  0.005). DZ
resulted in higher plasma adiponectin levels in ZDF rats
compared with controls (P  0.02), without any effect in ZL
rats.
Fasting plasma levels of FFA and TG were higher in ZDF
than in ZL animals (P  0.001). The plasma FFA levels were
decreased in DZ-ZDF compared with PF-ZDF (P 0.02) and
C-ZDF (P  0.001) rats. DZ-ZDF animals also had lower
plasma TGs than PF-ZDF and C-ZDF (P 0.0001) rats. 
Fasting plasma FFAs and TGs were not altered in DZ-ZL rats
compared with their controls.
C-ZDF animals had higher HbA1c levels compared with
C-ZL (P  0.0001). Whereas DZ lowered HbA1c in ZDF rats
compared with controls (P 0.001), it increased HbA1c level
in ZL rats (P  0.02).
Effect of DZ on glucose tolerance
Figure 2 illustrates the glucose and insulin responses to ip
glucose load (1 g/kg) after an 18-hour fast in ZDF and ZL
animals at the termination of the 8-wk study. The area under
the curve (AUC) for glucose (mmmin) and insulin
(pmolmin) data were analyzed for each subgroup of ZDF
and ZL rats. DZ treatment prevented the development of
diabetes in ZDF rats (AUC glucose: 928  55 vs. 1504  53
and 1748  64 mmmin; P  0.0005) and preserved insulin

compared with controls. DZ-ZL rats showed suppression of

Effect of DZ treatment on islet 3AR mRNA content and
AC activity
Figure 3 illustrates the islet 3AR mRNA levels and basal
AC activity. C-ZDF rats showed lower 3AR expression than
C-ZL animals (P  0.0001) (Fig. 3A). Whereas 3AR mRNA

it did not increase in DZ-ZL rats. However, C-ZDF rats had
higher basal AC activity than ZL animals (P  0.0001). DZ
treatment decreased AC activity only in ZDF rats (P 0.005)
but not in ZL rats (Fig. 3B).
Effect of DZ treatment on adipose 3AR mRNA content and
AC activity
Figure 4 shows the adipose tissue 3AR mRNA levels in
ZDF and ZL rats. C-ZDF rats showed lower 3AR expression
than C-ZL animals (P  0.0001) (Fig. 4A). Whereas 3AR
mRNA was higher in DZ-ZDF than PF and C-ZDF rats (P
0.005), it did not increase in DZ-ZL rats. C-ZDF rats had
lower basal AC activity than ZL animals (P  0.0001). DZ
treatment increased basal AC activity in adipose tissue only
in ZDF rats (P  0.01) but not in ZL rats (Fig. 4B).
Effect of DZ treatment on pancreatic islet FAS and ACC
mRNA contents
Figure 5 illustrates the pancreatic islet FAS and ACC
mRNA levels in ZDF and ZL rats. C-ZDF rats showed higher
islet FAS mRNA than ZL rats (P  0.0001) (Fig. 5A). DZ
caused lower islet FAS mRNA content compared with 
PF-ZDF (P  0.03) and C-ZDF (P  0.01) rats (Fig. 4A) without
any effect in ZL rats. Similarly, ZDF rats had higher islet ACC
mRNA than ZL rats (P 0.0001) (Fig. 5B). Whereas DZ-ZDF
animals showed lower ACC mRNA levels than PF-ZDF (P

not altered in DZ-ZL rats.

Figure 6 shows the pancreatic islet UCP-2 and insulin
mRNA levels in ZDF and ZL rats. C-ZDF rats showed higher
islet UCP-2 mRNA content than ZL rats (Fig. 6A). DZ 
treatment caused lower islet UCP-2 mRNA levels in ZDF (DZ vs.

in ZL islets. C-ZDF had higher islet insulin mRNA than ZL

insulin mRNA content in ZDF (DZ vs. PF and C, P 0.01) and
ZL (DZ vs. PF and C, P  0.02).
Effect of DZ treatment on pancreatic islet TG and
insulin contents
Figure 7 illustrates TG and insulin contents in freshly
isolated pancreatic islets of ZDF and ZL rats. Control ZDF
rats had higher islet TG than ZL rats (P  0.0001) (Fig. 7A).
DZ treatment reduced islet TG content in ZDF animals (P

insulin content in ZDF (P  0.001) and ZL (P  0.03) rats
compared with their controls.
Discussion
In our study, DZ treatment of prediabetic male ZDF rats
decreased food consumption and the rate of weight gain. In
Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
addition, DZ improved lipid profile and insulin sensitivity,
restored adipose tissue 3AR function, preserved insulin 
response to glucose, and prevented the development of 
diabetes in these animals. These metabolic changes were 
accompanied by altered 3AR function and decreased
expression of the key genes regulating lipogenesis and islet
TG content in pancreatic islets, but increased islet gene 
expression and insulin content.
Because insulin acts centrally to decrease body weight (29),
a possible hypothesis is that the obesity state and 
hyperpha-gia observed in Zucker rats are in part due to insulin 
resistance in the brain, as manifested by reduced capillary insulin
binding, which is thought to mediate the transport of insulin
into the brain. DZ treatment has significant anorectic and
antiobesity effects only in obese hyperphagic Zucker rats (30,
31), which are, in part, attributed to enhancement of central
nervous system insulin sensitivity and uptake (32) and 
reduction of lipogenesis, leading to a decrease in food intake
and rate of weight gain. In our study, DZ-treated ZDF rats
had a lower rate of weight gain than PF-ZDF and C-ZDF
animals, suggesting that the antiobesity effect of DZ is due
not only to decreased food intake but also to down-regula-
tion of key lipogenic enzymes (FAS and lipoprotein lipase)
in adipose tissue (22).

In the obesity state, adipose cellular enlargement is 
associated with a decreasing maximum capacity for total glucose
utilization (33), whereas glucose carbons are increasingly
diverted to TG glycerol synthesis at the expense of fatty acid
synthesis and glucose oxidation through the hexose-mono-
phosphate shunt (34). These alterations in relative activities
of the pathway for glucose metabolism are probably 
mediated by an observed increase in intracellular FFA with 
increasing adipocyte cell size (34, 35). DZ treatment of obese
Zucker rats reduces plasma TG and enhances glucose 
transport into adipocytes (31), suggesting reversal of increased TG
glycerol synthesis and enhanced glucose oxidation. Indeed,
the lipid-lowering effect of DZ in ZDF rats is partially due to
reduction in rate of weight gain and lower plasma glucose,
given that PF-ZDF rats showed only a modest reduction in
body weight and plasma glucose without significant 
reduction in plasma TG levels.
Consistent with our previous studies in obese Zucker rats,
DZ-ZDF animals were normoglycemic and showed higher
insulin sensitivity than controls (30, 31), whereas their higher
fasting insulin and insulin response to glucose compared
with controls appeared paradoxical. Induction of -cell rest
by short-term DZ dosing in insulin-treated patients with type
2 DM has been shown to improve -cell function without a
5482 Endocrinology, December 2004, 145(12):5476-5484
significant change in mean plasma glucose levels and body
weight (20). Song et al. demonstrated that in vitro DZ 
treatment of human islets resulted in attenuation of 
glucose-induced defects in first-phase insulin release and pulsatile
insulin secretion (36). Also, Aizawa et al. (37) demonstrated
that chronic suppression of hyperinsulinemia by DZ in 
Ot-suka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats resulted in marked
improvement of glucose tolerance and disappearance of 
exaggerated -cell insulin response in vitro. Therefore, 
reduction of -cell workload by DZ in ZDF rats improved glucose
tolerance and insulin secretory responsiveness similar to a
recent study (21). However, DZ resulted in relative 
hypoin-sulinemia and deterioration in ambient glucose in ZL rats
during the fed state.
Glucose is the major physiological activator of insulin 
secretion from pancreatic -cells. Although the regulation of
this activation is complex, elevated intracellular levels of
cAMP potentiate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent
manner (38). The intracellular concentration of cAMP is 
established by the balance between its synthesis by AC and
degradation by phosphodiesterases (39). Stimulation of AC
through 3ARs results in marked increase in the plasma
insulin concentrations in rats (40). Increasing levels of 
intracellular calcium further augment -cell AC activity (41). On
the other hand, 3AR agonists are believed to have an 
an-tidiabetic effect by modulating carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism in rodentsâ€™ adipose tissue (42). Surwit et al. showed
that a diet-induced animal model of diabetes and 
hyperin-sulinemic obesity is associated with blunting of 3AR 
function in adipocytes, which is then reversed by DZ suppression
of insulin (43). In our study, DZ treatment enhanced basal
3AR expression in adipose tissue of ZDF rats with a parallel
increase in AC activity. The absence of a DZ effect on basal

Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
3AR and AC in ZL rats may be due to unaltered ambient
glucose during the fasting state compared with their controls.
On the other hand, DZ treatment enhanced 3AR expression
but lowered AC activity in pancreatic islets of ZDF rats. It is
possible that decreased islet AC activity in only DZ-treated
ZDF rats was due to improved ambient glucose but not to an
inhibitory effect of DZ on calcium channels (44) given that no
changes in islet AC activity were observed in DZ-ZL rats. We
speculate that paradoxical up-regulation of islet 3AR 
expression in ZDF rats is a compensatory response to a marked
increase in islet insulin content, whereas unaltered 3AR
expression in ZL islets is likely due to only a modest increase
in islet insulin content. Our data suggest that chronic insulin
suppression restored 3-adrenergic function in both 
pancreatic islets and adipose tissue, leading to increased insulin
response to glucose and enhanced metabolic efficiency of
insulin.
Long-term exposure of pancreatic -cells to FFA could
alter the coupling of glucose metabolism to insulin secretion
by increasing basal insulin secretion, through changes in the
cytosolic ATP-to-ADP ratio leading to the closure of KATP
channels (45), but markedly decreasing insulin secretion in
response to glucose (44, 45). Chronic FFA exposure also alters
the energy metabolism of the -cell, elevates the redox state,
and increases basal oxygen consumption; this suggests an
effect at the level of ATP generation (46) or beyond. The
UCP-2 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the
islets and acts as a proton channel or transporter (47) and
uncouples the electrochemical gradient produced by the 
respiratory chain from ATP synthesis. Fatty acids or dietary
fats increase UCP-2 mRNA and protein levels in several
tissues (48, 49). Indeed, chronic exposure of the islets to FFAs
increases the expression level of the UCP-2 gene and 
decreases the effects of glucose on the ATP-to-ADP ratio and on
the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane 
potentials (50). However, changes in plasma FFA level did not
correlate with changes in islet TG or insulin mRNA level by
Harmon et al. (51), implying that antecedent hyperglycemia,
not hyperlipidemia, increases islet lipogenesis, with a 
resultant decrease in islet insulin mRNA levels in ZDF rats. In our
study, a decrease in islet UCP-2 mRNA of DZ-ZDF rats was
accompanied by increased islet insulin content and insulin
mRNA. These metabolic effects in islets are, in part, due to
improved ambient glucose (as evidenced by lower HbA1c in
ZDF rats) and lipids. On the other hand, the increased islet
insulin and insulin mRNA contents in DZ-ZL rats during the
fasted (basal) state are likely due to induction of -cell rest
despite deterioration of glycemic control secondary to 
relative hypoinsulinemia during the fed state.
However, because DZ-ZL rats had higher ambient glucose
during the fed state (elevated HbA1c) than control lean rats,
the novel adipokine, adiponectin/ACRP30, appears to play
an important role in modulating glucose tolerance and 
insulin sensitivity (52), without a compensatory effect on 
insulin secretion. Adiponectin is the most abundant 
adipose-specific protein and is exclusively expressed and secreted
from adipose tissue (53). Plasma adiponectin levels are 
decreased in obesity and type 2 DM (54, 55) and are inversely
correlated with fasting insulin and plasma TG (56). In our
study, plasma adiponectin levels were higher in DZ-ZDF rats
Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
than in their controls, which corresponded to higher insulin
sensitivity, normoglycemic state, and improved plasma
lipids.
Insulin stimulates the synthesis of leptin in adipose tissue
(57), whereas leptin inhibits the production of insulin in
-cells by modulation of KATP channel (19) and activation
of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B and subsequent
suppression of cAMP levels (58). Consistent with our 
previous studies, chronic suppression of insulin by DZ in 
prediabetic Zucker rats reduced plasma leptin levels (22, 31)
without any alteration in DZ-treated ZL rats. The plasma
leptin reduction in DZ-ZDF rats appears to be due to a
significant role of body fat and adipose tissue leptin 
production on plasma leptin levels (59).
In conclusion, prophylactic DZ treatment in prediabetic
ZDF rats decreased rate of weight gain, improved lipid 
profile, increased insulin sensitivity, restored 3AR function in
adipose tissue, enhanced islet insulin content, and preserved
the pancreatic insulin response to glucose. This was 
accompanied by alteration of 3AR function and decreased 
lipogenesis in pancreatic islets. These findings suggest that 
induction of -cell by DZ in the prediabetic state may serve as
a valuable therapeutic strategy in the prevention of -cell
failure and progression to diabetes in humans.

Discussion
In our study, DZ treatment of prediabetic male ZDF rats
decreased food consumption and the rate of weight gain. In
Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
addition, DZ improved lipid profile and insulin sensitivity,
restored adipose tissue 3AR function, preserved insulin 
response to glucose, and prevented the development of 
diabetes in these animals. These metabolic changes were 
accompanied by altered 3AR function and decreased
expression of the key genes regulating lipogenesis and islet
TG content in pancreatic islets, but increased islet gene 
expression and insulin content.
Because insulin acts centrally to decrease body weight (29),
a possible hypothesis is that the obesity state and 
hyperpha-gia observed in Zucker rats are in part due to insulin 
resistance in the brain, as manifested by reduced capillary insulin
binding, which is thought to mediate the transport of insulin
into the brain. DZ treatment has significant anorectic and
antiobesity effects only in obese hyperphagic Zucker rats (30,
31), which are, in part, attributed to enhancement of central
nervous system insulin sensitivity and uptake (32) and 
reduction of lipogenesis, leading to a decrease in food intake
and rate of weight gain. In our study, DZ-treated ZDF rats
had a lower rate of weight gain than PF-ZDF and C-ZDF
animals, suggesting that the antiobesity effect of DZ is due
not only to decreased food intake but also to down-regula-
tion of key lipogenic enzymes (FAS and lipoprotein lipase)
in adipose tissue (22).

In the obesity state, adipose cellular enlargement is 
associated with a decreasing maximum capacity for total glucose
utilization (33), whereas glucose carbons are increasingly
diverted to TG glycerol synthesis at the expense of fatty acid
synthesis and glucose oxidation through the hexose-mono-
phosphate shunt (34). These alterations in relative activities
of the pathway for glucose metabolism are probably 
mediated by an observed increase in intracellular FFA with 
increasing adipocyte cell size (34, 35). DZ treatment of obese
Zucker rats reduces plasma TG and enhances glucose 
transport into adipocytes (31), suggesting reversal of increased TG
glycerol synthesis and enhanced glucose oxidation. Indeed,
the lipid-lowering effect of DZ in ZDF rats is partially due to
reduction in rate of weight gain and lower plasma glucose,
given that PF-ZDF rats showed only a modest reduction in
body weight and plasma glucose without significant 
reduction in plasma TG levels.
Consistent with our previous studies in obese Zucker rats,
DZ-ZDF animals were normoglycemic and showed higher
insulin sensitivity than controls (30, 31), whereas their higher
fasting insulin and insulin response to glucose compared
with controls appeared paradoxical. Induction of -cell rest
by short-term DZ dosing in insulin-treated patients with type
2 DM has been shown to improve -cell function without a
5482 Endocrinology, December 2004, 145(12):5476-5484
significant change in mean plasma glucose levels and body
weight (20). Song et al. demonstrated that in vitro DZ 
treatment of human islets resulted in attenuation of 
glucose-induced defects in first-phase insulin release and pulsatile
insulin secretion (36). Also, Aizawa et al. (37) demonstrated
that chronic suppression of hyperinsulinemia by DZ in 
Ot-suka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats resulted in marked
improvement of glucose tolerance and disappearance of 
exaggerated -cell insulin response in vitro. Therefore, 
reduction of -cell workload by DZ in ZDF rats improved glucose
tolerance and insulin secretory responsiveness similar to a
recent study (21). However, DZ resulted in relative 
hypoinsulinemia and deterioration in ambient glucose in ZL rats
during the fed state.
Glucose is the major physiological activator of insulin 
secretion from pancreatic -cells. Although the regulation of
this activation is complex, elevated intracellular levels of
cAMP potentiate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent
manner (38). The intracellular concentration of cAMP is 
established by the balance between its synthesis by AC and
degradation by phosphodiesterases (39). Stimulation of AC
through 3ARs results in marked increase in the plasma
insulin concentrations in rats (40). Increasing levels of 
intracellular calcium further augment -cell AC activity (41). On
the other hand, 3AR agonists are believed to have an 
an-tidiabetic effect by modulating carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism in rodentsâ€™ adipose tissue (42). Surwit et al. showed
that a diet-induced animal model of diabetes and 
hyperin-sulinemic obesity is associated with blunting of 3AR 
function in adipocytes, which is then reversed by DZ suppression
of insulin (43). In our study, DZ treatment enhanced basal
3AR expression in adipose tissue of ZDF rats with a parallel
increase in AC activity. The absence of a DZ effect on basal

Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
3AR and AC in ZL rats may be due to unaltered ambient
glucose during the fasting state compared with their controls.
On the other hand, DZ treatment enhanced 3AR expression
but lowered AC activity in pancreatic islets of ZDF rats. It is
possible that decreased islet AC activity in only DZ-treated
ZDF rats was due to improved ambient glucose but not to an
inhibitory effect of DZ on calcium channels (44) given that no
changes in islet AC activity were observed in DZ-ZL rats. We
speculate that paradoxical up-regulation of islet 3AR 
expression in ZDF rats is a compensatory response to a marked
increase in islet insulin content, whereas unaltered 3AR
expression in ZL islets is likely due to only a modest increase
in islet insulin content. Our data suggest that chronic insulin
suppression restored 3-adrenergic function in both 
pancreatic islets and adipose tissue, leading to increased insulin
response to glucose and enhanced metabolic efficiency of
insulin.
Long-term exposure of pancreatic -cells to FFA could
alter the coupling of glucose metabolism to insulin secretion
by increasing basal insulin secretion, through changes in the
cytosolic ATP-to-ADP ratio leading to the closure of KATP
channels (45), but markedly decreasing insulin secretion in
response to glucose (44, 45). Chronic FFA exposure also alters
the energy metabolism of the -cell, elevates the redox state,
and increases basal oxygen consumption; this suggests an
effect at the level of ATP generation (46) or beyond. The
UCP-2 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the
islets and acts as a proton channel or transporter (47) and
uncouples the electrochemical gradient produced by the 
respiratory chain from ATP synthesis. Fatty acids or dietary
fats increase UCP-2 mRNA and protein levels in several
tissues (48, 49). Indeed, chronic exposure of the islets to FFAs
increases the expression level of the UCP-2 gene and 
decreases the effects of glucose on the ATP-to-ADP ratio and on
the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane 
potentials (50). However, changes in plasma FFA level did not
correlate with changes in islet TG or insulin mRNA level by
Harmon et al. (51), implying that antecedent hyperglycemia,
not hyperlipidemia, increases islet lipogenesis, with a 
resultant decrease in islet insulin mRNA levels in ZDF rats. In our
study, a decrease in islet UCP-2 mRNA of DZ-ZDF rats was
accompanied by increased islet insulin content and insulin
mRNA. These metabolic effects in islets are, in part, due to
improved ambient glucose (as evidenced by lower HbA1c in
ZDF rats) and lipids. On the other hand, the increased islet
insulin and insulin mRNA contents in DZ-ZL rats during the
fasted (basal) state are likely due to induction of -cell rest
despite deterioration of glycemic control secondary to 
relative hypoinsulinemia during the fed state.
However, because DZ-ZL rats had higher ambient glucose
during the fed state (elevated HbA1c) than control lean rats,
the novel adipokine, adiponectin/ACRP30, appears to play
an important role in modulating glucose tolerance and 
insulin sensitivity (52), without a compensatory effect on 
insulin secretion. Adiponectin is the most abundant 
adipose-specific protein and is exclusively expressed and secreted
from adipose tissue (53). Plasma adiponectin levels are 
decreased in obesity and type 2 DM (54, 55) and are inversely
correlated with fasting insulin and plasma TG (56). In our
study, plasma adiponectin levels were higher in DZ-ZDF rats
Alemzadeh and Tushaus â€¢ Diazoxide Prevents Diabetes in ZDF Rats
than in their controls, which corresponded to higher insulin
sensitivity, normoglycemic state, and improved plasma
lipids.
Insulin stimulates the synthesis of leptin in adipose tissue
(57), whereas leptin inhibits the production of insulin in
-cells by modulation of KATP channel (19) and activation
of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B and subsequent
suppression of cAMP levels (58). Consistent with our 
previous studies, chronic suppression of insulin by DZ in 
prediabetic Zucker rats reduced plasma leptin levels (22, 31)
without any alteration in DZ-treated ZL rats. The plasma
leptin reduction in DZ-ZDF rats appears to be due to a
significant role of body fat and adipose tissue leptin 
production on plasma leptin levels (59).
In conclusion, prophylactic DZ treatment in prediabetic
ZDF rats decreased rate of weight gain, improved lipid 
profile, increased insulin sensitivity, restored 3AR function in
adipose tissue, enhanced islet insulin content, and preserved
the pancreatic insulin response to glucose. This was 
accompanied by alteration of 3AR function and decreased 
lipogenesis in pancreatic islets. These findings suggest that 
induction of -cell by DZ in the prediabetic state may serve as
a valuable therapeutic strategy in the prevention of -cell
failure and progression to diabetes in humans.

Results
Effect of DZ on food intake and body weight
Table 2 shows weight and food intake in ZDF and ZL rats.
C-ZDF rats exhibited higher initial weight and greater
weight gain over the 8-wk period than ZL animals (P
0.001). The final body weight and average weight gain in
DZ-ZDF animals were reduced compared with PF-ZDF (P
0.02) and C-ZDF rats (P 0.001), respectively. Also, PF-ZDF
rats had lower final weight (P 0.02) and rate of weight gain
(P  0.02) than C-ZDF animals. Body weight differences
between DZ-ZDF and C-ZDF (P  0.02) and PF-ZDF and
C-ZDF (P  0.02) first emerged at ages 8 and 9 wk, 
respectively (data not shown). Body weight differences between
DZ-ZDF and PF-ZDF (P 0.02) were first observed at 13 wk
of age. DZ treatment did not affect body weight in ZL rats.
When food intake was measured during the treatment period

Effect of DZ on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, leptin,
adiponectin, lipid concentrations, and HbA1c
Figure 1 illustrates weekly fasting plasma glucose in obese
ZDF and ZL animals. DZ-treated ZDF rats had lower fasting
plasma glucose concentrations than C-ZDF and PF-ZDF rats
(P  0.0001) at the completion of the study. Fasting plasma
glucose differences between DZ-ZDF and C-ZDF (P 0.005)
initially appeared at age 8 wk. Also, PF-ZDF had lower
fasting plasma glucose levels than C-ZDF (P  0.02) during
the last 2 wk of the study.
Table 3 shows fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin,
leptin, adiponectin, FFAs, and TG, after 8 wk of DZ or vehicle
treatment. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin 
concentrations were higher among ZDF animals compared with ZL
rats (P  0.001). Fasting plasma glucose was lower in 
DZ-ZDF compared with PF-ZDF (P  0.002) and C-ZDF (P
0.001). However, PF-ZDF had lower plasma glucose than
C-ZDF rats (P  0.02). Fasting plasma insulin levels were
higher in DZ-ZDF (P  0.001) compared with PF-ZDF and

C-ZDF animals (P  0.001). PF-ZDF also had higher fasting
plasma insulin levels than C-ZDF rats (P  0.01).
Fasting plasma leptin levels were higher in ZDF than in ZL
animals (P 0.001). Although DZ treatment reduced plasma
leptin in ZDF animals (P 0.001), it did not affect leptin level
in ZL rats. Furthermore, ZL animals showed higher fasting
plasma adiponectin levels than ZDF rats (P  0.005). DZ
resulted in higher plasma adiponectin levels in ZDF rats
compared with controls (P  0.02), without any effect in ZL
rats.
Fasting plasma levels of FFA and TG were higher in ZDF
than in ZL animals (P  0.001). The plasma FFA levels were
decreased in DZ-ZDF compared with PF-ZDF (P 0.02) and
C-ZDF (P  0.001) rats. DZ-ZDF animals also had lower
plasma TGs than PF-ZDF and C-ZDF (P 0.0001) rats. 
Fasting plasma FFAs and TGs were not altered in DZ-ZL rats
compared with their controls.
C-ZDF animals had higher HbA1c levels compared with
C-ZL (P  0.0001). Whereas DZ lowered HbA1c in ZDF rats
compared with controls (P 0.001), it increased HbA1c level
in ZL rats (P  0.02).
Effect of DZ on glucose tolerance
Figure 2 illustrates the glucose and insulin responses to ip
glucose load (1 g/kg) after an 18-hour fast in ZDF and ZL
animals at the termination of the 8-wk study. The area under
the curve (AUC) for glucose (mmmin) and insulin
(pmolmin) data were analyzed for each subgroup of ZDF
and ZL rats. DZ treatment prevented the development of
diabetes in ZDF rats (AUC glucose: 928  55 vs. 1504  53
and 1748  64 mmmin; P  0.0005) and preserved insulin
response to IPGTT (AUC insulin: 149  7 vs. 116  6 and

but not in ZL rats (Fig. 3B).
Effect of DZ treatment on adipose 3AR mRNA content and

than C-ZL animals (P  0.0001) (Fig. 4A). Whereas 3AR
mRNA was higher in DZ-ZDF than PF and C-ZDF rats (P
0.005), it did not increase in DZ-ZL rats. C-ZDF rats had
lower basal AC activity than ZL animals (P  0.0001). DZ
treatment increased basal AC activity in adipose tissue only
in ZDF rats (P  0.01) but not in ZL rats (Fig. 4B).
Effect of DZ treatment on pancreatic islet FAS and ACC
mRNA contents
Figure 5 illustrates the pancreatic islet FAS and ACC
mRNA levels in ZDF and ZL rats. C-ZDF rats showed higher
islet FAS mRNA than ZL rats (P  0.0001) (Fig. 5A). DZ
caused lower islet FAS mRNA content compared with 
PF-ZDF (P  0.03) and C-ZDF (P  0.01) rats (Fig. 4A) without
any effect in ZL rats. Similarly, ZDF rats had higher islet ACC
mRNA than ZL rats (P 0.0001) (Fig. 5B). Whereas DZ-ZDF
animals showed lower ACC mRNA levels than PF-ZDF (P
0.01) and C-ZDF animals (P  0.005), islet ACC mRNA was
not altered in DZ-ZL rats.

Dysregulation of the adipoinsular axis in male obese Zucker
diabetic fatty (ZDF; fa/fa) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes,
results in chronic hyperinsulinemia and increased de novo
lipogenesis in islets, leading to -cell failure and diabetes.
Diazoxide (DZ; 150 mg/kgd), an inhibitor of insulin secretion,
was administered to prediabetic ZDF animals for 8 wk as a
strategy for prevention of diabetes. DZ reduced food intake
(P < 0.02) and rate of weight gain only in ZDF rats (P < 0.01).
Plasma insulin response to glucose load was attenuated in
DZ-Zucker lean rats (ZL; P < 0.01), whereas DZ-ZDF had
higher insulin response to glucose than controls (P < 0.001).
DZ improvedhemoglobinA1c (P< 0.001) andglucose tolerance
in ZDF (P< 0.001), but deteriorated hemoglobin A1c in ZL rats
(P < 0.02) despite normal tolerance in the fasted state. DZ
lowered plasma leptin (P < 0.001), free fatty acid, and

(P< 0.005) and adenylate cyclase activity (P< 0.01) in adipose
tissue from ZDF rats only, whereas it enhanced islet 3-
adrenergic receptor mRNA (P < 0.005) but paradoxically 
decreased islet adenylate cyclase activity (P < 0.005) in these
animals. Islet fatty acid synthase mRNA (P < 0.03), acyl 
coenzyme A carboxylase mRNA (P< 0.01), uncoupling protein-2
mRNA (P < 0.01), and triglyceride content (P < 0.005) were
only decreased in DZ-ZDF rats, whereas islet insulin mRNA
and insulin content were increased in DZ-ZDF (P < 0.01) and
DZ-ZL rats (P < 0.03). DZ-induced -cell rest improved the
lipid profile, enhanced themetabolic efficiency of insulin, and
prevented -cell dysfunction and diabetes in diabetes-prone
animals. This therapeutic strategy may be beneficial in 
preventing -cell failure and progression to diabetes in humans.
(Endocrinology 145: 5476-5484, 2004)
TYPE 2 DIABETES mellitus (DM) has become the
complication of obesity worldwide (1). Obesemostcommon
humans and experimental animals characteristically 
manifest hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and 
hyperlipid-emia, which predispose to glucose intolerance and diabetes
(2). Dysregulation of the adipoinsular axis in obese 
individuals due to defective leptin, an Ob gene product, reception
by -cells, is believed to result in chronic hyperinsulinemia
and may contribute to the pathogenesis of adipogenic 
diabetes (2). Similarly, the inability of leptin to suppress insulin
secretion in leptin-insensitive pancreatic islets of male obese
Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF fa/fa) male rats, a model of type
2 DM, results in chronic hyperinsulinemia and increased de
novo lipogenesis in pancreatic islets (3, 4). Enhanced activity
of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a key insulin-sensitive enzyme
regulating lipogenesis, and overaccumulation of fat in 
pancreatic islets of obese ZDF rats cause -cell failure with a
predictable progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic
state (5).
There is abundant evidence linking high plasma free fatty
acid (FFA) levels of obesity to the increased risk of type 2 DM

in humans and rodents (6, 7). Male ZDF rats develop 
progressive insulin resistance and glucose intolerance between
3 and 8 wk of age and become overtly diabetic usually 
between 8 and 10 wk (8). In obese prediabetic ZDF fa/fa rats, a
rapid rise in plasma FFA levels 2 wk before the appearance
of hyperglycemia (4) is associated with a 10-fold increase in
islet triglyceride (TG) content, which coincides with the onset
of islet dysfunction and overt diabetes (7). High tissue levels
of fatty acyl coenzyme A interfere with glucose metabolism,
not only in skeletal muscle (9), where they play an important
role in insulin resistance (10), but also in -cells, where they
may cause the secretory dysfunction that characterizes type
2 DM (11). Over time, hyperglycemia worsens, a 
phenomenon that has been attributed to the deleterious effect of
chronic hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) (12, 13) or chronic 
hy-perlipidemia (lipotoxicity) (14, 15) on -cell function, and is
often accompanied by increased TG content and decreased
insulin gene expression (16, 17). A leptin receptor mutation
in ZDF rats is believed to interfere with leptinâ€™s modulation
of islet
its antisteatotic effect with 
result-KATP channel and
ant chronic hyperinsulinemia and islet cell lipotoxicity,
which lead to -cell failure and diabetes (4, 18). Attenuation
of insulin release by
KATP channel openers like diazoxide
(DZ) (19) can improve the insulin release pattern in both
human and animal models of type 2 DM. This effect is likely
mediated via hyperpolarization of -cells, thereby providing
-cell rest by reducing insulin release (20, 21). Chronic 
suppression of hyperinsulinemia in mildly hyperglycemic obese
Zucker (fa/fa) rats by DZ also reduces plasma FFA, TG, and
leptin levels and down-regulates adipose tissue, FAS 
activity, and lipoprotein lipase mRNA (22). To assess the
