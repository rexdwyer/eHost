>>>section: conclusion
Conclusions
MDMA moderate doses, more close to those used by
human adolescents, do not elicit in adolescent rats oxidative
stress related changes in the brain. Meanwhile, ATP levels
in frontal cortex were decreased following MDMA. MDMA
treatment in adolescent rats promoted morphological tissue
alterations in the heart, kidneys, and liver, as well as rises in
liver quinoproteins. New studies are required to assess the
impact of moderate MDMA doses in adolescent animals to
verify whether these brain and peripheral organ changes are
long-lasting and may be reflected later during adulthood.

from Abbott (IL, USA). Lidocaine 25 mg/g + Prilocaine
25 mg/g (EMLA®) was acquired from AstraZeneca
(London, UK). The fluorescent peptide substrates for the
caspase activity assays were acquired from Peptanova
(Sandhausen, Germany). For western blot, 
dinitropenhyl-KLH rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Invitrogen/

the other reagents used were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). MDMA (HCl salt) was extracted and
purified from MDMA tablets, which were high in purity,
and were kindly provided by the Portuguese Criminal 
Police Department. As we have previously detailed, the 
extracted salt was fully characterized by mass spectrometry
and nuclear magnetic resonance, yielding a high degree of
purity that was superior to 95 % [26].
Animals
Fourteen adolescent male Wistar rats at postnatal day
(PND) 40 and weighing in average 115 ± 11 g were born
at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences Abel 
Salazar-University of Porto (ICBAS-UP) animal facilities.
Animals were housed in a controlled environment
[temperature of 22.0 ± 2.0 °C, 40 % humidity and
12 hours (h) light/dark cycles]. Animals had ad libitum
access to food and water and throughout the 
experimental period had permanent veterinary supervision.
All procedures were performed as to give the proper
animal care, to reduce suffering and stress. Experimental
animal procedures were in agreement with the European
Council Directive (2010/63/EU) guidelines that where
transposed into Portuguese law (Decreto-Lei n.° 113/
2013, de 7 de Agosto). Additionally, the experiments
were conducted with the approval of the Ethical 
Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto
(process n° 17/03/2014) and approved by the Portuguese
National Authority for Animal Health (General 
Directory of Veterinary Medicine) (process n° 0421/000/000/
2015).
Experimental protocol
Three days before the experiment, the dorsocervical
region was trichotomised and a local anaesthetic (Lido-
caine 25 mg/g + Prilocaine 25 mg/g) was allowed to act
for about 60 minutes (min). Then each animal was
subjected to a brief inhalatory anaesthesia with 
isoflur-ane to perform a subcutaneous insertion of a
temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems Inc)
with minimum animal discomfort. This transponder 
ensures precise core body temperature measurements
throughout the entire experimental period, as we 
reported before [27]. Prior to MDMA administration, 
animals were maintained in groups allowing conspecific
social interactions. In the administration day and for the
next 24 h, animals were housed individually.
Animals were randomly assigned to the two 
experimental groups: control (n = 7) and MDMA-treated (n =
7). We selected this sample size per group based on a
pilot study that we performed. Additionally, seven 
animals per treatment allow the mathematical detection of
differences among means of two standard deviations (as-
suming a 5 % significance level in a t-test and a 90 %
power) [28]. For a full explanation on these statistical
calculations please see reference [28]. Additionally, 
sample size took into consideration ethical reasons related
to animal welfare in a pre-clinical study conducted with
drugs of abuse, such as the present one. The group
treated with MDMA received three doses of 5 mg/kg
MDMA salt, i.p., every 2 h (total cumulative dose of
15 mg/kg). MDMA was prepared at the day of use in a
concentration of 2.5 mg/mL in sterile NaCl 0.9 % (sa-
line solution). Control animals received saline solution
at the same schedule and using equivalent injection
volumes of treated animals. Rats’ temperature was
monitored and registered every 15 min for a total of
7 h, after the first dose. Food and water consumption,
as well as animal weight were evaluated before the first
injection and at the next day. Twenty-four hours 
following the first MDMA administration adolescent rats
were sacrificed.
Brain and organ tissue collection
Animals were anesthetized and
volatile anaesthetic, isoflurane.
blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. 
Following sacrifice, brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus,
frontal cortex and striatum) and peripheral organs
(liver, heart and kidneys) were collected. The collection
of the different brain regions was performed in 
agreement to a rat brain atlas [29], and the dissection 
techniques were conducted in accordance to a previous
work [30]. The brain and peripheral organs were also
weighted.
Brain tissue treatment
Samples of brain areas from the right hemisphere were
collected in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitors [0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate, 1 % Triton
X-100, 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl,
euthanized with the
Before decapitation,
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 4 of 14
50 mM Tris, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium
metavanadate, 0.25 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), proteases inhibitor cocktail from Sigma, pH =
8.0]. Then brain samples were homogenized while kept
on ice using a sonicator (20 seconds, continuously) and
centrifugation followed (16,000 g, 15 min at 4 °C). The
supernatants were separated for the protein 
carbonylation and quinoprotein analysis. Meanwhile, brain 
samples obtained from the left side of each hemisphere were
placed in 5 % perchloric acid and homogenized in a
sonicator (20 seconds, continuously), while tubes were
kept on ice. Centrifugation was followed (16,000 g,
10 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants separated
for ATP and glutathione determinations. The sample
pellets were stored for protein determination. All 
samples were frozen at −80 °C until further analysis.
Organ tissue treatment
Small sections (5 mm3) of liver (from different lobes),
heart (apex) and kidneys (including cortex and medulla)
were fixed during 24 h using a 4 % paraformaldehyde 
solution in PBS, and further processed for qualitative
histologic analysis. A section of liver, heart and kidneys
was collected for caspases activity assay in caspase lysis
buffer (0.5 % Triton X-100, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM 
magnesium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and
1 mM PMSF, pH = 7.4). Another section was collected in
complete RIPA buffer supplemented with protease 
inhibitors, and homogenized using a sonicator (30 seconds,
continuously), while tubes were kept on ice. 
Centrifugation was followed (2376 g, 10 min at 4 °C) and the 
supernatants were collected for the quinoprotein and protein
carbonylation determinations. Samples in caspase lysis
buffer or in RIPA buffer were stored at −80 °C until 
further analysis. Another section of each organ was 
collected and homogenized in an Ultra-Turrax (samples
diluted in 0.1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate 
solution, pH = 7.4). One portion of homogenate was stored
at −20 °C for protein quantification. Other portion of
homogenate was added to perchloric acid 5 % solution
and centrifuged (16,000 g, 10 min at 4 °C). The resultant
supernatants were then stored for ATP and total 
glutathione (GSHt) or oxidized glutathione (GSSG) 
biochemical determinations. Samples for reduced glutathione
(GSH)/GSSG analysis were stored at −20 °C, meanwhile
those for ATP quantification were frozen at −80 °C.
Measurement of plasma biomarkers
The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
ala-nine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as total creatine
kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), were 
determined in blood plasma as previously described by our
group [31]. The enzymatic assays were conducted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the 
apparatus ABX Pentra 400 (Kyoto, Japan).
Assessment of ATP levels
ATP levels were quantified by a bioluminescent assay
using the luciferin-luciferase system, as described in 
detail in previous works [26, 32]. The results are presented
in nmol of ATP per mg of protein.
Measurement of GSHt, GSH and GSSG
The GSHt or GSSG levels were evaluated by the 5,5′-
dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-GSSG reductase recycling
assay, as previously we described in detail [26, 32]. GSH
levels were calculated by the equation: GSH = GSHt - 2
× GSSG. Levels of GSHt, GSSG and GSH were 
normalized to the protein content (results presented in nmol
GSH per mg protein or nmol GSSG per mg protein).
Protein carbonylation assay
Protein carbonylation was determined as we previously
reported [33], with minor modifications. Samples
(0.1 mg protein/mL) reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhy-
drazine (0.2 μg) and were loaded into nitrocellulose
membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia 
Bio-tech) in a slot blot device. After washing steps, 
membranes were exposed to the primary antibody (rabbit
polyclonal anti-DNP, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. 
Incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody
(anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase, 1:2000, 1 h) was followed.
Exposure to Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA) was used to visualize membrane bands.
Digital images were obtained and treated with Molecular
Imager® ChemiDocTM XRS+ System (Bio-Rad, CA,
USA). Membranes were analysed with Image Lab 
Software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and results expressed as % of
optical density control values.
Assessment of quinoproteins
The protein-bound quinones were determined using
nitrotetrazolium blue chloride/glycinate colorimetric
assay, as previously described [26]. For the assay, lysates
in RIPA buffer were used, and the reaction mixture of
brain samples contained 50 μg of protein, meanwhile
peripheral organs samples contained 25 μg of protein.
Histological tissue procedures
Sections of liver, heart, and kidneys were prepared, and
analysed, as previously described by our group [31]. 
Following fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde and paraffin
embedding, sections with 5 μm were mounted on 
silane-coated slides (Sigma, S4651-72EA), and stained with
hematoxylin/eosin following routine procedures. 
Samples were photographed and analysed in a light
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 5 of 14
microscope (Carl Zeiss Imager A1 attached to a digital
camera AxioCam MRc 5, Oberkochen, Germany).
Assessment of caspases-3, -9 and -8 activities
A fluorescent assay for tissues was used to determine
each caspase activity in the liver, heart and kidneys of
the animals, as previously described by our group [31].
The following fluorescent peptide substrates were used:

caspase-8, and Ac-LEHD-AMC for caspase-9. Caspase
activity was expressed in fluorescent units per μg of 
protein (FU/μg protein).

Abstract
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) is a worldwide drug of abuse commonly
used by adolescents. Most reports focus on MDMA’s neurotoxicity and use high doses in adult animals, meanwhile
studies in adolescents are scarce. We aimed to assess in rats the acute MDMA toxicity to the brain and peripheral
organs using a binge dose scheme that tries to simulate human adolescent abuse.
Methods: Adolescent rats (postnatal day 40) received three 5 mg/kg doses of MDMA (estimated equivalent to
two/three pills in a 50 kg adolescent), intraperitoneally, every 2 h, while controls received saline. After 24 h animal
sacrifice took place and collection of brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum) and
peripheral organs (liver, heart and kidneys) occurred.
Results: Significant hyperthermia was observed after the second and third MDMA doses, with mean increases of
1 °C as it occurs in the human scenario. MDMA promoted ATP levels fall in the frontal cortex. No brain oxidative
stress-related changes were observed after MDMA. MDMA-treated rat organs revealed significant histological
tissue alterations including vascular congestion, but no signs of apoptosis or necrosis were found, which was
corroborated by the lack of changes in plasma biomarkers and tissue caspases. In peripheral organs, MDMA did not
affect significantly protein carbonylation, glutathione, or ATP levels, but liver presented a higher vulnerability as
MDMA promoted an increase in quinoprotein levels.
Conclusions: Adolescent rats exposed to a moderate MDMA dose, presented hyperthermia and acute tissue
damage to peripheral organs without signs of brain oxidative stress.

Background
Over the past decades, amphetamine-type 
psychostimu-lants, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA, “ecstasy”) became widely used as recreational
drugs by adolescents and young people around the
world [1, 2]. According to the United Nations Office of
Drugs and Crime, the estimated global users of MDMA
ranged from 9.4 to 28.2 million in 2012 [3]. In Europe,
2.0 of the 2.5 million past-year “ecstasy” users in 2010
were estimated to be 15-34 years old; and, in the United

States of America, 2.5 of the estimated 2.6 million people
who had used MDMA in the past year were aged from 14
to 34 years [3]. Recreational use of MDMA is frequently
done by binge administration that is a pattern of several
administrations over a short time period [4-6].
MDMA is a drug frequently used by adolescents and
therefore we need to understand the consequences of
MDMA exposure at this age through the administration
of doses and schemes more close to the human 
situation. Interestingly, the vast majority of studies tend
to use adult animals for studying MDMA toxicity. One
reason for this might be that the majority of studies
focus on MDMA’s neurotoxicity and neurotoxic effects
seem to be less severe in younger animals when
compared to adult animals [2]. MDMA administration

to adult laboratory animals was shown to promote 
long-term depletion of monoamine neurotransmitter content,
damage to the nerve terminals, neuronal cell death and
long-lasting cognitive impairments [1, 2]. Notably, 
studies conducted with adolescent animals have shown that
MDMA exposure to neurotoxic doses leads to deficits in
the serotonergic system [2] and also late changes in
memory and learning abilities [7, 8]. Investigation on
adolescent laboratory animals is of extreme importance,
given that studies with human adolescents have ethical
barriers, making extremely difficult to enrol this 
population in studies that evaluate drug abuse toxicity. 
Nonetheless, studies with young adults reported deficits in
the serotonergic system [9, 10], decreased grey matter
concentration [11] and cognitive deficits [12, 13] 
following MDMA abuse.
In order to produce neurotoxicity in laboratory 
ani-mals’ researchers need a certain dose of MDMA, as
neurotoxicity was shown to be dose-dependent [1, 2].
MDMA neurotoxic doses in rats generally range from
20 to 40 mg/kg on a session of exposure, but the 
cumulative dose can be much higher when treatments take
place through several days [1]. These high doses, while
important for studying neurotoxic related events, do not
match the typical MDMA user profile, as they tend to
be extremely high and correlate only to a high-intensity
abuser. One can try to extrapolate the dose used in 
animals to the equivalent in humans using the allometric
scaling principles, for instance: Human dose (mg/kg) =
animal dose (mg/kg) × (animal weight/human weight)1/4
[14]. This method does not account for the differences
in MDMA metabolism or administration route between
humans and rats, but is certainly of great value for an
approximate extrapolation. According to this relation a
dose of 40 mg/kg in adult rats, used in a daily session, is
equivalent to approximately 700 mg in a human with
70 kg. According to the latest European Union report
MDMA pills range from 57 to 102 mg [15], and 
therefore that dose would mean an average intake of more
than seven pills in a single session, a rather extreme 
scenario. The binge dosing pattern that we selected for this
study [three times 5 mg/kg MDMA, intraperitoneal
(i.p.), every 2 h] was reported to promote long-term 
serotonergic neurotoxicity in adult Wistar rats (10 week
old) [16]. We have conducted experiments that proved
that this MDMA regimen did not induce serotonergic
toxicity 7 days following MDMA administration to 
adolescent (PND 40) Wistar rats, as no 5-HT depletion
could be found in any of the four brain areas evaluated
(manuscript being prepared for submission). Using the
mentioned formula based on allometric scaling 
principles, we estimate that a cumulative MDMA dose of
15 mg/kg in adolescent rats is estimated to be equivalent
in a 50 kg human adolescent to 170 mg. “Ecstasy” typical
abusers generally take more than one tablet per session,
ranging from two to four tablets in accordance with the
binge-dosing pattern [5, 6]. Therefore, and in accordance
with the last European Union report on drugs, we 
estimate that the dose used in our protocol is equivalent to
the intake of two to three pills by adolescents using the
binge-dosing pattern. Accordingly, the current paradigm
of exposure to adolescent animals tries to mimic the
dose schedule used by human adolescents. For that 
reason studies using more moderate doses that closely
match the typical MDMA user are needed.
The majority of studies focus on MDMA’s 
neurotoxicity and neglect the toxicity of this drug to the 
peripheral organs. In vivo and in vitro studies reported
decreases in adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) [17-19]
and in glutathione levels [20-22], as well as increases in
protein carbonylation [23] in the peripheral organs 
following exposure to MDMA or its metabolites. 
Additionally, MDMA abuse was associated with histopathological
evidences of toxicity to the liver, heart and kidneys in
humans [24, 25]. Most studies that evaluate human “ec-
stasy” toxicity to peripheral organs are conducted 
following fatal outcomes or after admission to emergency
rooms. Studies are lacking regarding the evaluation of
MDMA-induced damage to organs following lower
doses. Moreover, at this point, studies in adolescent 
animal models regarding peripheral toxicity using moderate
MDMA doses have not been done.
In our study, we aimed to investigate MDMA toxic 
effects to the brain and peripheral organs in an adolescent
rat, using a moderate dose by binge administration of
MDMA, which mimics better the dose schedule of “ec-
stasy” users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in an adolescent rat model to evaluate 
simultaneously in three peripheral organs oxidative stress 
parameters and histological damage.

from Abbott (IL, USA). Lidocaine 25 mg/g + Prilocaine
25 mg/g (EMLA®) was acquired from AstraZeneca
(London, UK). The fluorescent peptide substrates for the
caspase activity assays were acquired from Peptanova
(Sandhausen, Germany). For western blot, 
dinitropenhyl-KLH rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Invitrogen/
Life Technologies (NY, USA), meanwhile 0.45 μm
Amersham Protran nitrocellulose blotting membrane and
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit

(PA, USA). Histofluid was purchased from Marienfeld
(Lauda-Königshofen, Germany), Harris hematoxylin was
obtained at Harris Surgipath (IL, USA), and eosin 1 % 
solution from Biostain (Traralgon, Australia). From Bio-Rad
Laboratories (CA, USA) was acquired the Bio-Rad DC
protein assay kit and the Clarity Western ECL reagent. All
the other reagents used were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). MDMA (HCl salt) was extracted and
purified from MDMA tablets, which were high in purity,
and were kindly provided by the Portuguese Criminal 
Police Department. As we have previously detailed, the 
extracted salt was fully characterized by mass spectrometry
and nuclear magnetic resonance, yielding a high degree of
purity that was superior to 95 % [26].
Animals
Fourteen adolescent male Wistar rats at postnatal day
(PND) 40 and weighing in average 115 ± 11 g were born
at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences Abel 
Salazar-University of Porto (ICBAS-UP) animal facilities.
Animals were housed in a controlled environment
[temperature of 22.0 ± 2.0 °C, 40 % humidity and
12 hours (h) light/dark cycles]. Animals had ad libitum
access to food and water and throughout the 
experimental period had permanent veterinary supervision.
All procedures were performed as to give the proper
animal care, to reduce suffering and stress. Experimental
animal procedures were in agreement with the European
Council Directive (2010/63/EU) guidelines that where
transposed into Portuguese law (Decreto-Lei n.° 113/
2013, de 7 de Agosto). Additionally, the experiments
were conducted with the approval of the Ethical 
Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto
(process n° 17/03/2014) and approved by the Portuguese
National Authority for Animal Health (General 
Directory of Veterinary Medicine) (process n° 0421/000/000/
2015).
Experimental protocol
Three days before the experiment, the dorsocervical
region was trichotomised and a local anaesthetic (Lido-
caine 25 mg/g + Prilocaine 25 mg/g) was allowed to act
for about 60 minutes (min). Then each animal was
subjected to a brief inhalatory anaesthesia with 
isoflur-ane to perform a subcutaneous insertion of a
temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems Inc)
with minimum animal discomfort. This transponder 
ensures precise core body temperature measurements
throughout the entire experimental period, as we 
reported before [27]. Prior to MDMA administration, 
animals were maintained in groups allowing conspecific
social interactions. In the administration day and for the
next 24 h, animals were housed individually.
Animals were randomly assigned to the two 
experimental groups: control (n = 7) and MDMA-treated (n =
7). We selected this sample size per group based on a
pilot study that we performed. Additionally, seven 
animals per treatment allow the mathematical detection of
differences among means of two standard deviations (as-
suming a 5 % significance level in a t-test and a 90 %
power) [28]. For a full explanation on these statistical
calculations please see reference [28]. Additionally, 
sample size took into consideration ethical reasons related
to animal welfare in a pre-clinical study conducted with
drugs of abuse, such as the present one. The group
treated with MDMA received three doses of 5 mg/kg
MDMA salt, i.p., every 2 h (total cumulative dose of
15 mg/kg). MDMA was prepared at the day of use in a
concentration of 2.5 mg/mL in sterile NaCl 0.9 % (sa-
line solution). Control animals received saline solution
at the same schedule and using equivalent injection
volumes of treated animals. Rats’ temperature was
monitored and registered every 15 min for a total of
7 h, after the first dose. Food and water consumption,
as well as animal weight were evaluated before the first
injection and at the next day. Twenty-four hours 
following the first MDMA administration adolescent rats
were sacrificed.
Brain and organ tissue collection
Animals were anesthetized and
volatile anaesthetic, isoflurane.
blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. 
Following sacrifice, brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus,
frontal cortex and striatum) and peripheral organs
(liver, heart and kidneys) were collected. The collection
of the different brain regions was performed in 
agreement to a rat brain atlas [29], and the dissection 
techniques were conducted in accordance to a previous
work [30]. The brain and peripheral organs were also
weighted.
Brain tissue treatment
Samples of brain areas from the right hemisphere were
collected in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitors [0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate, 1 % Triton
X-100, 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl,
euthanized with the

50 mM Tris, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium
metavanadate, 0.25 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), proteases inhibitor cocktail from Sigma, pH =
8.0]. Then brain samples were homogenized while kept
on ice using a sonicator (20 seconds, continuously) and
centrifugation followed (16,000 g, 15 min at 4 °C). The
supernatants were separated for the protein 
carbonylation and quinoprotein analysis. Meanwhile, brain 
samples obtained from the left side of each hemisphere were
placed in 5 % perchloric acid and homogenized in a
sonicator (20 seconds, continuously), while tubes were
kept on ice. Centrifugation was followed (16,000 g,
10 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants separated
for ATP and glutathione determinations. The sample
pellets were stored for protein determination. All 
samples were frozen at −80 °C until further analysis.
Organ tissue treatment
Small sections (5 mm3) of liver (from different lobes),
heart (apex) and kidneys (including cortex and medulla)
were fixed during 24 h using a 4 % paraformaldehyde 
solution in PBS, and further processed for qualitative
histologic analysis. A section of liver, heart and kidneys
was collected for caspases activity assay in caspase lysis
buffer (0.5 % Triton X-100, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM 
magnesium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and
1 mM PMSF, pH = 7.4). Another section was collected in
complete RIPA buffer supplemented with protease 
inhibitors, and homogenized using a sonicator (30 seconds,
continuously), while tubes were kept on ice. 
Centrifugation was followed (2376 g, 10 min at 4 °C) and the 
supernatants were collected for the quinoprotein and protein
carbonylation determinations. Samples in caspase lysis
buffer or in RIPA buffer were stored at −80 °C until 
further analysis. Another section of each organ was 
collected and homogenized in an Ultra-Turrax (samples
diluted in 0.1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate 
solution, pH = 7.4). One portion of homogenate was stored
at −20 °C for protein quantification. Other portion of
homogenate was added to perchloric acid 5 % solution
and centrifuged (16,000 g, 10 min at 4 °C). The resultant
supernatants were then stored for ATP and total 
glutathione (GSHt) or oxidized glutathione (GSSG) 
biochemical determinations. Samples for reduced glutathione
(GSH)/GSSG analysis were stored at −20 °C, meanwhile
those for ATP quantification were frozen at −80 °C.
Measurement of plasma biomarkers
The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as total creatine
kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), were 
determined in blood plasma as previously described by our
group [31]. The enzymatic assays were conducted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the 
apparatus ABX Pentra 400 (Kyoto, Japan).
Assessment of ATP levels
ATP levels were quantified by a bioluminescent assay
using the luciferin-luciferase system, as described in 
detail in previous works [26, 32]. The results are presented
in nmol of ATP per mg of protein.
Measurement of GSHt, GSH and GSSG
The GSHt or GSSG levels were evaluated by the 5,5′-
dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-GSSG reductase recycling
assay, as previously we described in detail [26, 32]. GSH
levels were calculated by the equation: GSH = GSHt - 2
× GSSG. Levels of GSHt, GSSG and GSH were 
normalized to the protein content (results presented in nmol
GSH per mg protein or nmol GSSG per mg protein).
Protein carbonylation assay
Protein carbonylation was determined as we previously
reported [33], with minor modifications. Samples
(0.1 mg protein/mL) reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhy-
drazine (0.2 μg) and were loaded into nitrocellulose
membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia 
Bio-tech) in a slot blot device. After washing steps, 
membranes were exposed to the primary antibody (rabbit
polyclonal anti-DNP, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. 
Incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody
(anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase, 1:2000, 1 h) was followed.
Exposure to Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA) was used to visualize membrane bands.
Digital images were obtained and treated with Molecular
Imager® ChemiDocTM XRS+ System (Bio-Rad, CA,
USA). Membranes were analysed with Image Lab 
Software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and results expressed as % of
optical density control values.
Assessment of quinoproteins
The protein-bound quinones were determined using
nitrotetrazolium blue chloride/glycinate colorimetric
assay, as previously described [26]. For the assay, lysates
in RIPA buffer were used, and the reaction mixture of
brain samples contained 50 μg of protein, meanwhile
peripheral organs samples contained 25 μg of protein.
Histological tissue procedures
Sections of liver, heart, and kidneys were prepared, and
analysed, as previously described by our group [31]. 
Following fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde and paraffin
embedding, sections with 5 μm were mounted on 
silane-coated slides (Sigma, S4651-72EA), and stained with
hematoxylin/eosin following routine procedures. 
Samples were photographed and analysed in a light
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 5 of 14
microscope (Carl Zeiss Imager A1 attached to a digital
camera AxioCam MRc 5, Oberkochen, Germany).
Assessment of caspases-3, -9 and -8 activities
A fluorescent assay for tissues was used to determine
each caspase activity in the liver, heart and kidneys of
the animals, as previously described by our group [31].
The following fluorescent peptide substrates were used:
Ac-DMQD-AMC, for caspase-3, Ac-IETD-AMC, for
caspase-8, and Ac-LEHD-AMC for caspase-9. Caspase
activity was expressed in fluorescent units per μg of 
protein (FU/μg protein).
Protein sample quantification
The protein content of samples in RIPA or caspase lysis
buffer was quantified using the DC Protein Assay kit
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA). For other samples, proteins were
quantified by the Lowry method [34].
Statistical analysis
Results in tables and graphics are presented as mean ±
standard deviation. Statistical analysis was conducted
using GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, La
Jolla California, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk normality test
was conducted before group comparison. For data where
two groups were compared, the t-test was used for a
normal distribution or the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test
when data did not follow a normal distribution. Statistical
analysis of the temperature, included in Fig. 1, was
conducted by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measurements, followed by Bonferroni
post-hoc test, once a significant p was obtained. Statistical
significance was accepted at p values less than 0.05.
Results
MDMA evoked hyperthermia, but no changes in body
weight, food or water intake
Three MDMA doses were given to the animals (each
dose 5 mg/kg i.p., every 2 h) and the first dose did not
cause significant changes in body temperature (Fig. 1).
After the second dose of MDMA, rats had a significantly
higher body temperature when compared to the control
group (p <0.0001). Temperature persisted significantly
higher for almost 2 h after the third dose in treated 
animals. The temperature of MDMA-treated animals never
surpassed 39 °C even after the third MDMA dose (Fig. 1).
The temperature was also measured 24 h post-MDMA
binge administration and no differences were observed
in the temperature among controls and MDMA-treated
rats (data not shown).
Recordings of body weight gain, food or water intake
before and 24 h after exposure showed no differences
among control and MDMA-treated rats (data not
shown). In fact, there was a slight decrease in the body
weight of animals in both groups, possibly as a result of
the animal stress due to the manipulation. The food
consumption was similar in both control and 
MDMA-treated animals. However, there was a tendency for an
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 6 of 14
increased water intake in animals that received MDMA,
but it was not statistically significant (data not shown).
Liver, heart and kidneys weights were not changed
Each core organ (liver, heart, kidneys, and brain) had
their weight registered and the weight ratio of each
organ was taken to brain weight. No significant 
differences were observed between MDMA-treated rats and
the control group for all collected organs (Table 1).
MDMA decreased ATP content in the frontal cortex
Twenty-four hours after MDMA exposure, ATP levels
showed no significant changes in cerebellum, 
hippocampus and striatum, as can be seen in Fig. 2a, b and d, 
respectively. Importantly, there was a significant decrease
in the ATP content of the frontal cortex of the 
MDMA-treated group (p = 0.007) (Fig. 2c).
No changes in oxidative stress related parameters in the
brain areas
There were no significant alterations in the levels of
GSHt, GSSG, GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio in the 
cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum of
treated rats when compared to controls (Table 2).
Moreover, MDMA had no influence on quinoprotein
levels in the brain areas. In cerebellum, hippocampus,
frontal cortex and striatum no differences were found
between controls and MDMA-treated animals regarding
quinoprotein levels (Table 2).
The levels of protein carbonylation in the cerebellum,
hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum are also 
presented in Table 2, and there were no significant 
alterations in protein carbonyl levels in the four brain areas
of treated animals.
No changes in plasma AST, ALT, CK-MB and CK levels
The plasma levels of CK, CK-MB, AST and ALT were
measured 24 h after exposure as biomarkers of liver,
heart or muscle integrity (Table 3). There were no 
significant differences in these parameters between control
and MDMA-treated animals. The ratio AST/ALT was
Liver weight/brain weight ratio, heart weight/brain weight ratio, and kidneys
weight/brain weight ratio of control and MDMA-treated rats. Results are 
presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from seven animals
in each group. The mean brain weight of control animals was 1.57 ± 0.04, and
of MDMA-treated was 1.63 ± 0.05. Statistical comparisons were made using the
t-test for the heart weight/brain weight ratio and the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum
test for the liver weight/brain weight ratio and kidneys weight/brain
weight ratio
also calculated, but no significant differences among
groups were found (data not shown).
MDMA promoted vacuolization, oedema and vascular
congestion in the peripheral organs
The qualitative histologic examination of peripheral
organs (liver, heart and kidneys) of control and 
MDMA-treated rats was performed by means of optical 
microscopy. Representative histological figures can be observed
in Fig. 3.
The control group showed a preserved liver tissue
structure (Fig. 3a). Livers of MDMA-treated rats 
presented a marked cellular vacuolization in the periportal
regions, and sinusoidal dilatation with periportal and
centrilobular vascular congestion (Fig. 3b). No necrotic
zones or interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration was
observed in either group.
In the histological analysis of the heart, both controls
(Fig. 3c) and MDMA-treated (Fig. 3d) animals revealed a
normal tissue organization without signs of necrosis or
interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration. MDMA exposed
animals presented random signs of cardiomyocyte oedema,
particularly in the sub-endocardic region (Fig. 3d).
The renal tissue organization remained preserved in
the control group (Fig. 3e). However, the 
MDMA-treated group presented scattered interstitial oedema,
detected by the enlarged space between the tubular
structures, and signs of vascular congestion (Fig. 3f ). No
necrotic zones or interstitial inflammatory cell 
infiltration was observed in either group.
GSH homeostasis unaffected in the liver, heart, and
kidneys
The levels of GSHt, GSSG, GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio
in the liver, heart and kidneys in both groups are 
included in Table 4. No differences were found for all
these parameters in the three organs, between control
and MDMA-treated animals.
ATP content was unchanged in the peripheral organs
ATP levels were measured in the liver, heart and 
kidneys, and no significant differences in the ATP content
were observed between control and MDMA-treated 
animals, as can be seen in Table 4.
Protein-bound quinones formation increased by MDMA in
the liver
In Fig. 4, the levels of protein-bound quinones (quinopro-
teins) in the liver, heart and kidneys of control and
MDMA-treated animals can be observed. There was a 
significant increase in hepatic quinoprotein levels in the
MDMA-treated group (p = 0.039) (Fig. 4a). No differences
were found regarding this parameter in the heart or 
kidneys when comparing both groups (Fig. 4b and c).
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 7 of 14
MDMA showed a tendency to increase protein
carbonylation in the kidneys
In Table 4 are presented the results of protein 
carbonylation in the liver, heart and kidneys in the two groups. No
significant differences were found in the levels of protein
carbonyls in the liver and heart between groups.
However, data showed a tendency for an increase
(p = 0.051) in protein carbonylation in the kidneys of
MDMA-treated rats, although not reaching statistical
significance.
Caspase-8 activity decreased in the liver, while caspase-3
and -9 activities remained unaltered
Data concerning the activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in
liver, heart, and kidneys in the two groups are presented
in Table 5. Caspase-8 activity significantly decreased in
the liver of MDMA-treated rats when compared to 
controls (p = 0.038). No differences were found in the 
activity of this protease either in heart or kidneys. The
activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 had no significant
alterations in all three organs following MDMA when
compared to the control group.
Discussion
In the present work, we studied the acute effects of a
moderate MDMA binge dose scheme (3 × 5 mg/kg,
every 2 h, i.p.) in an adolescent rat model. Using a dose
that does not evoke serotonergic neurotoxicity in 
adolescent rats we did not observe any signs of brain oxidative
stress and the toxic effects occurred mainly in the 
peripheral organs. The major findings were: 1) sustained
hyperthermic response after the second MDMA dose; 2)
decreased ATP levels in the frontal cortex; 3) no 
oxidative stress related changes in the brain areas studied, as
no alterations were seen in GSH/GSSG ratio, 
quinoprotein and protein carbonylation levels; 4) signs of 
histological damage were seen in the liver, heart, but most
notoriously in the kidneys; 5) quinoproteins increased in
the liver of MDMA-treated animals.
Animals reproduce the MDMA-induced hyperthermia
seen in humans. Neurotoxic doses can promote core
body temperatures of 40 °C in rats [27, 35], once again
more related to an intensive abuser profile. In PND 40
rats 4 × 10 mg/kg, every 2 h, i.p., can evoke a robust
hyperthermia, reaching 2.5 °C above the control levels
[27]. In this study, MDMA promoted a significant 
increase in adolescent rats’ body temperature, rendering a
mean increase of about 1 °C. Therefore, we proved that
lower MDMA doses do produce hyperthermia in 
adolescent rats. Our dose scheme clearly more closely 
reproduces the human scenario, since human studies found
body temperature increases of about 1 °C in “ecstasy”
dance clubbers [36], thus rendering more reliable the 
extrapolation to human adolescents.

MDMA abuse promotes several physiological changes,
and, for that reason, we also evaluated body weight gain,
as well as water and food consumption. In the literature,
the cardiovascular changes and anorectic actions of
showed an hyperthermic response and long-term 5-HT
depletion, which were blocked when the drug was 
administrated under low environmental temperature (15 °
C) [16]. Therefore there is a tight relation between body
temperature and MDMA serotonergic neurotoxicity
[16]. Moreover, we have shown that our MDMA 
regimen (3 × 5 mg/kg, every 2 h, i.p.) in adolescent (PND
40) Wistar rats did not promote serotonergic 
neurotoxicity 7 days after MDMA exposure (manuscript in 
prep-aration). Altogether, our results show that hyperthermia
per se is not the triggering factor for serotonergic 
toxicity or to other neurotoxic actions. Nevertheless, the
hyperthermia induced by MDMA certainly potentiates
the toxicity found in the brain and most importantly in
the peripheral organs.
Despite the absence of serotonergic neurotoxicity, we
sought to study other markers of brain toxicity, namely
energetic status and oxidative stress parameters. It is
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 9 of 14
important to know whether doses that do not cause 
depletion of monoamines can elicit other toxic brain
changes. Several studies found transient changes in ATP
brain levels following amphetamines exposure, namely
MDMA or methamphetamine (METH). In fact, 
amphetamines are known to promote changes in tricarboxylic
acid cycle’s enzymes function, inhibition of the 
complexes in mitochondrial electron transport chain and
overall interference with mitochondrial dynamics [40]. A
binge dose regimen of MDMA (4 × 10 mg/kg, every 2 h,
i.p.) with a total dose of 40 mg/kg found decreases in
the ATP levels in the striatum at time-points 1, 12 and
24 h, as well as in the hippocampus 12 h after MDMA
exposure [41]. A single METH dose of 5 mg/kg, i.p.,
caused a decline in ATP brain content in adolescent
Wistar rats (4 week old) 30 min after administration
[42]. The same authors also found that ATP brain levels
returned to control values 24 h following exposure to
the single METH dose [42]. Most likely there is a 
possible transitory effect in brain ATP levels caused by
MDMA, and the time frame may disclose that short 
periods following exposure a decrease in ATP levels occurs,
meanwhile longer periods following exposure ATP brain
levels can recover. Of note that only the frontal cortex
area showed a decrease in the ATP levels in the present
study. The involvement of this area in both memory and
decision-making is widely known, however it is unclear
whether this event is related with the impairment in
memory and learning abilities seen in young animals 
exposed to MDMA [7, 8]. Importantly, in humans, “ec-
stasy” use was related to altered brain activity patterns
during associative learning in the left dorsolateral

levels, in nanomol per mg of protein (nmol/mg protein), and the GSH/GSSG ratio
are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from six to seven
animals. Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for GSHt, GSSG, GSH
levels in the heart, kidneys and liver, and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the liver; and the
Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test for the GSH/GSSG ratio levels in the heart and
kidneys. Results of protein carbonylation, in percentage of controls (% of control),
are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from six to seven
animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for the
protein carbonylation in the heart and liver, meanwhile the Mann-Whitney Rank
Sum test showed in the kidneys a tendency for a change in protein carbonylation
(p= 0.051 treatment vs. control). Results of ATP levels, in nmol per mg of protein
(nmol/mg protein), are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained
from seven animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were made using the

prefrontal cortex [13], an effect that we speculate to be
related to MDMA-induced energetic impairment in the
frontal cortex. More investigation is needed in 
adolescent animals to confirm the long-lasting effects of 
amphetamines in ATP brain levels.
The metabolism of MDMA is a known triggering factor
for the toxicity of this drug. The MDMA metabolites are
highly reactive and can evoke oxidative stress [1]. Several
studies showed that MDMA metabolites promote 
neurotoxic effects to laboratory animals [43, 44]. Moreover,
MDMA metabolites, N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (N-
Me-α-MeDA, 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine, HHMA)
and α-methyldopamine (α-MeDA, 3,4-dihydroxyampheta-
mine, HHA), induced neuronal death in cultured cells [26,
39, 45]. N-Me-α-MeDA and α-MeDA are important
MDMA metabolites that can be oxidized into 
ortho-quinones, and that enter a redox cycle-eliciting oxidative
stress [1]. Moreover, thioether MDMA metabolites were
shown to promote depletion of neuronal GSH and the
formation of quinoproteins in cultured neurons [26], and
the mixture of MDMA and its metabolites were shown
to impair mitochondrial fusion/fission equilibrium and
trafficking in cultured neurons [46]. Catechol MDMA 
metabolites were also shown to promote toxicity to 
cardio-myocytes [17] and to hepatocytes [47] in vitro. There are
other contributing factors for MDMA-induced 
oxidative stress, including monoamine neurotransmitters
metabolism by monoamine oxidase [27], and nitric
oxide formation leading to damaging reactive nitrogen
species [1].
Our paradigm of MDMA exposure elicited no 
oxidative stress related changes in the adolescent rat brain.
Other studies reported decreases in glutathione levels
[48] and increases in protein carbonylation [27] in the
rat brain after MDMA exposure. Major differences 
between the previously mentioned studies and the current
study are the use of higher doses, older animals, and 
different time-points at measurements. The lack of changes
in brain oxidative stress parameters following 
MDMA-induced hyperthermia confirms that hyperthermia 
induction per se is not a guarantee for MDMA-evoked
brain oxidative stress.
Regarding the oxidative stress related parameters 
evaluated in the liver, heart, and kidneys, we could only find
an increase in quinoproteins in the liver following
MDMA exposure. In fact, MDMA metabolism is 
primarily hepatic, and, as previously mentioned, promotes
the formation of catechol metabolites that can generate
protein-bound quinones. Moreover, in rat hepatocytes,
catechol MDMA metabolites promoted ortho-quinones
formation and oxidative stress [47]. The increase in liver
quinoprotein formation possibly reflects the 
contribution of MDMA metabolism and the formation of 
reactive metabolites, and reveals the higher susceptibility of
the liver to MDMA-evoked toxicity.
Using higher doses and older animals, others reported
decreases in glutathione levels. Following administration
of a high MDMA dose in a total of 160 mg/kg (20 mg/
kg, i.p., 2 daily doses for 4 days), authors found 
decreases in GSH levels in the rat liver 3 and 6 h following
MDMA, which were recovered after 7 days [20, 22]. The
heart of rats exposed to MDMA in a dose of 20 mg/kg,
i.p., showed a reduction in total GSH levels at the 6 h
time-point [22]. The fact that our low MDMA binge
dose did not elicit changes in GSH levels in the
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 11 of 14
Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities in the heart, kidneys and liver of adolescent rats
that received either saline or MDMA. Results of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities,
in fluorescent units per μg of protein (FU/μg protein), are presented as mean
± standard deviation, and were obtained from seven animals in each group.
Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for the caspase-3 activity in
the liver, heart and kidneys and caspase-8 and -9 activities in the heart and
kidneys, and the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test for the caspase-8 and -9 
activities in the liver (*p <0.05 treatment vs. control)
peripheral organs 24 h following exposure, reveals that
GSH levels might not have been affected or that GSH
could decrease at early times of exposure but then 
recovered. Overall, moderate MDMA doses in rats do not
seem to elicit long lasting GSH and ATP decreases to
the peripheral organs.
Protein carbonylation increase was observed in the rat
liver 12 h following two doses of MDMA 10 mg/kg
administered orally with a 24 h interval [23]. Enhanced
carbonylation in the kidney has been associated with the
development of hypertension and kidney disease [49]. 
Importantly, MDMA administration was shown to increase
blood pressure in humans [36], as well as in laboratory 
animals [4]. In accordance, both the histological damage and
the trend for protein carbonylation increase that we found
in the kidneys reveal that this organ may be highly prone
to damage following MDMA.
Vascular alterations that we observed in the three
studied organs, including vascular congestion, after 
exposure to MDMA have been associated to the 
MDMA-elicited hyperthermic response [50]. In fact, other studies
reported vascular lesions in the peripheral organs as a
consequence of hyperthermia [51, 52]. The exposure of
Wistar rats to high temperature environments was 
previously shown to result in several vascular lesions in the
heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs of animals that can
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 12 of 14
possibly lead to functional organ failure [52]. Those 
effects were similar to the signs of damage observed in
our study. Halpin and co-workers reported 
morphological damages in the liver of rats 24 h after the 
treatment with METH. The referred morphological changes
were prevented when the hyperthermic response 
induced by the treatment with METH was blocked, 
suggesting that liver damage is possibly a consequence of
METH-induced hyperthermia [51]. Therefore, it can be
postulated that the hyperthermic response observed in
our experiment may have contributed to the observed
histological alterations. The liver may be an organ with
greater susceptibility to MDMA toxicity as indicated not
only by the tissue damage, but also because it was the only
to show an increase in quinoprotein formation. Of note,
that one of the most frequently reported damage promoted
by MDMA in humans is hepatotoxicity [18, 24, 25]. In fact,
MDMA liver metabolism and hyperthermia may cooperate
to render the liver very vulnerable to damage.
The lack of changes in the plasma levels of AST, ALT,
CK and CK-MB after MDMA exposure corroborates the
absence of necrosis in the heart and liver. Moreover, the 
absence of caspase activity increase in the organs proves the
lack of severe damage to the tissues, given that caspases are
important effectors of the apoptotic pathway [53]. The 
notable exception of caspase-8 activity in the liver, which 
revealed a significant decrease in MDMA-treated rats, might
be related to a repression of genes related to apoptosis. The
inhibition of caspase-8 activity has been observed in hepatic
cells through nitric oxide signalling [54]. In cultured rat
striated cardiac myocytes there was a repression of 
caspase-1 and caspase-8 genes following exposure to MDMA [55].
Using higher doses (20 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily during 4 days,
in a total dose of 160 mg/kg), hepatic necrosis with 
inflammatory infiltrate around hepatic vein and increases in AST
levels were found at the 6 h time-point [20]. The heart is
particularly susceptible to oxidative stress-related injuries
and amphetamines like MDMA evoke cardiotoxicity [56].
Exposure of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) to MDMA
binges (9 mg/kg, intravenous twice daily, for 4 days), a
neurotoxic dose regimen, showed that MDMA promoted
cardiac foci of inflammatory infiltrates, the presence of 
necrotic cells and/or disrupted cytoarchitecture [4]. Another
report in adult rats (200-250 g) after a single MDMA dose
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) showed myocardial necrosis and following
16 h the heart exhibited macrophagic monocytes around
the necrotic myocardial cells [22]. Our study used lower
MDMA doses in adolescent rats and drug exposed hearts
showed a particular vulnerability of the myocytes from the
sub-endocardic region. Reports from MDMA users 
following fatalities describe major organ changes, including
necrosis, oedema and inflammation [1, 24, 25]. These 
important human findings report a rather extreme scenario
following the course of MDMA intoxication. Our report
more reliably reproduces the hyperthermia seen in human
abusers and organ changes might be more similar to
those seen in adolescents.
Conclusions
MDMA moderate doses, more close to those used by
human adolescents, do not elicit in adolescent rats oxidative
stress related changes in the brain. Meanwhile, ATP levels
in frontal cortex were decreased following MDMA. MDMA
treatment in adolescent rats promoted morphological tissue
alterations in the heart, kidneys, and liver, as well as rises in
liver quinoproteins. New studies are required to assess the
impact of moderate MDMA doses in adolescent animals to
verify whether these brain and peripheral organ changes are
long-lasting and may be reflected later during adulthood.

Abstract
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) is a worldwide drug of abuse commonly
used by adolescents. Most reports focus on MDMA’s neurotoxicity and use high doses in adult animals, meanwhile
studies in adolescents are scarce. We aimed to assess in rats the acute MDMA toxicity to the brain and peripheral
organs using a binge dose scheme that tries to simulate human adolescent abuse.
Methods: Adolescent rats (postnatal day 40) received three 5 mg/kg doses of MDMA (estimated equivalent to
two/three pills in a 50 kg adolescent), intraperitoneally, every 2 h, while controls received saline. After 24 h animal
sacrifice took place and collection of brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum) and
peripheral organs (liver, heart and kidneys) occurred.
Results: Significant hyperthermia was observed after the second and third MDMA doses, with mean increases of
1 °C as it occurs in the human scenario. MDMA promoted ATP levels fall in the frontal cortex. No brain oxidative
stress-related changes were observed after MDMA. MDMA-treated rat organs revealed significant histological
tissue alterations including vascular congestion, but no signs of apoptosis or necrosis were found, which was
corroborated by the lack of changes in plasma biomarkers and tissue caspases. In peripheral organs, MDMA did not
affect significantly protein carbonylation, glutathione, or ATP levels, but liver presented a higher vulnerability as
MDMA promoted an increase in quinoprotein levels.
Conclusions: Adolescent rats exposed to a moderate MDMA dose, presented hyperthermia and acute tissue
damage to peripheral organs without signs of brain oxidative stress.

Background
Over the past decades, amphetamine-type 
psychostimu-lants, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA, “ecstasy”) became widely used as recreational
drugs by adolescents and young people around the
world [1, 2]. According to the United Nations Office of
Drugs and Crime, the estimated global users of MDMA
ranged from 9.4 to 28.2 million in 2012 [3]. In Europe,
2.0 of the 2.5 million past-year “ecstasy” users in 2010
were estimated to be 15-34 years old; and, in the United

States of America, 2.5 of the estimated 2.6 million people
who had used MDMA in the past year were aged from 14
to 34 years [3]. Recreational use of MDMA is frequently
done by binge administration that is a pattern of several
administrations over a short time period [4-6].
MDMA is a drug frequently used by adolescents and
therefore we need to understand the consequences of
MDMA exposure at this age through the administration
of doses and schemes more close to the human 
situation. Interestingly, the vast majority of studies tend
to use adult animals for studying MDMA toxicity. One
reason for this might be that the majority of studies
focus on MDMA’s neurotoxicity and neurotoxic effects
seem to be less severe in younger animals when
compared to adult animals [2]. MDMA administration

to adult laboratory animals was shown to promote 
long-term depletion of monoamine neurotransmitter content,
damage to the nerve terminals, neuronal cell death and
long-lasting cognitive impairments [1, 2]. Notably, 
studies conducted with adolescent animals have shown that
MDMA exposure to neurotoxic doses leads to deficits in
the serotonergic system [2] and also late changes in
memory and learning abilities [7, 8]. Investigation on
adolescent laboratory animals is of extreme importance,
given that studies with human adolescents have ethical
barriers, making extremely difficult to enrol this 
population in studies that evaluate drug abuse toxicity. 
Nonetheless, studies with young adults reported deficits in
the serotonergic system [9, 10], decreased grey matter
concentration [11] and cognitive deficits [12, 13] 
following MDMA abuse.
In order to produce neurotoxicity in laboratory 
ani-mals’ researchers need a certain dose of MDMA, as
neurotoxicity was shown to be dose-dependent [1, 2].
MDMA neurotoxic doses in rats generally range from
20 to 40 mg/kg on a session of exposure, but the 
cumulative dose can be much higher when treatments take
place through several days [1]. These high doses, while
important for studying neurotoxic related events, do not
match the typical MDMA user profile, as they tend to
be extremely high and correlate only to a high-intensity
abuser. One can try to extrapolate the dose used in 
animals to the equivalent in humans using the allometric
scaling principles, for instance: Human dose (mg/kg) =
animal dose (mg/kg) × (animal weight/human weight)1/4
[14]. This method does not account for the differences
in MDMA metabolism or administration route between
humans and rats, but is certainly of great value for an
approximate extrapolation. According to this relation a
dose of 40 mg/kg in adult rats, used in a daily session, is
equivalent to approximately 700 mg in a human with
70 kg. According to the latest European Union report
MDMA pills range from 57 to 102 mg [15], and 
therefore that dose would mean an average intake of more
than seven pills in a single session, a rather extreme 
scenario. The binge dosing pattern that we selected for this
study [three times 5 mg/kg MDMA, intraperitoneal
(i.p.), every 2 h] was reported to promote long-term 
serotonergic neurotoxicity in adult Wistar rats (10 week
old) [16]. We have conducted experiments that proved
that this MDMA regimen did not induce serotonergic
toxicity 7 days following MDMA administration to 
adolescent (PND 40) Wistar rats, as no 5-HT depletion
could be found in any of the four brain areas evaluated
(manuscript being prepared for submission). Using the
mentioned formula based on allometric scaling 
principles, we estimate that a cumulative MDMA dose of
15 mg/kg in adolescent rats is estimated to be equivalent
in a 50 kg human adolescent to 170 mg. “Ecstasy” typical
abusers generally take more than one tablet per session,
ranging from two to four tablets in accordance with the
binge-dosing pattern [5, 6]. Therefore, and in accordance
with the last European Union report on drugs, we 
estimate that the dose used in our protocol is equivalent to
the intake of two to three pills by adolescents using the
binge-dosing pattern. Accordingly, the current paradigm
of exposure to adolescent animals tries to mimic the
dose schedule used by human adolescents. For that 
reason studies using more moderate doses that closely
match the typical MDMA user are needed.
The majority of studies focus on MDMA’s 
neurotoxicity and neglect the toxicity of this drug to the 
peripheral organs. In vivo and in vitro studies reported
decreases in adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) [17-19]
and in glutathione levels [20-22], as well as increases in
protein carbonylation [23] in the peripheral organs 
following exposure to MDMA or its metabolites. 
Additionally, MDMA abuse was associated with histopathological
evidences of toxicity to the liver, heart and kidneys in
humans [24, 25]. Most studies that evaluate human “ec-
stasy” toxicity to peripheral organs are conducted 
following fatal outcomes or after admission to emergency
rooms. Studies are lacking regarding the evaluation of
MDMA-induced damage to organs following lower
doses. Moreover, at this point, studies in adolescent 
animal models regarding peripheral toxicity using moderate
MDMA doses have not been done.
In our study, we aimed to investigate MDMA toxic 
effects to the brain and peripheral organs in an adolescent
rat, using a moderate dose by binge administration of
MDMA, which mimics better the dose schedule of “ec-
stasy” users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in an adolescent rat model to evaluate 
simultaneously in three peripheral organs oxidative stress 
parameters and histological damage.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
In the present work, we studied the acute effects of a
moderate MDMA binge dose scheme (3 × 5 mg/kg,
every 2 h, i.p.) in an adolescent rat model. Using a dose
that does not evoke serotonergic neurotoxicity in 
adolescent rats we did not observe any signs of brain oxidative
stress and the toxic effects occurred mainly in the 
peripheral organs. The major findings were: 1) sustained
hyperthermic response after the second MDMA dose; 2)
decreased ATP levels in the frontal cortex; 3) no 
oxidative stress related changes in the brain areas studied, as
no alterations were seen in GSH/GSSG ratio, 
quinoprotein and protein carbonylation levels; 4) signs of 
histological damage were seen in the liver, heart, but most
notoriously in the kidneys; 5) quinoproteins increased in
the liver of MDMA-treated animals.
Animals reproduce the MDMA-induced hyperthermia
seen in humans. Neurotoxic doses can promote core
body temperatures of 40 °C in rats [27, 35], once again
more related to an intensive abuser profile. In PND 40
rats 4 × 10 mg/kg, every 2 h, i.p., can evoke a robust
hyperthermia, reaching 2.5 °C above the control levels
[27]. In this study, MDMA promoted a significant 
increase in adolescent rats’ body temperature, rendering a
mean increase of about 1 °C. Therefore, we proved that
lower MDMA doses do produce hyperthermia in 
adolescent rats. Our dose scheme clearly more closely 
reproduces the human scenario, since human studies found
body temperature increases of about 1 °C in “ecstasy”
dance clubbers [36], thus rendering more reliable the 
extrapolation to human adolescents.

MDMA abuse promotes several physiological changes,
and, for that reason, we also evaluated body weight gain,
as well as water and food consumption. In the literature,
the cardiovascular changes and anorectic actions of
showed an hyperthermic response and long-term 5-HT
depletion, which were blocked when the drug was 
administrated under low environmental temperature (15 °
C) [16]. Therefore there is a tight relation between body
temperature and MDMA serotonergic neurotoxicity
[16]. Moreover, we have shown that our MDMA 
regimen (3 × 5 mg/kg, every 2 h, i.p.) in adolescent (PND
40) Wistar rats did not promote serotonergic 
neurotoxicity 7 days after MDMA exposure (manuscript in 
prep-aration). Altogether, our results show that hyperthermia
per se is not the triggering factor for serotonergic 
toxicity or to other neurotoxic actions. Nevertheless, the
hyperthermia induced by MDMA certainly potentiates
the toxicity found in the brain and most importantly in
the peripheral organs.
Despite the absence of serotonergic neurotoxicity, we
sought to study other markers of brain toxicity, namely
energetic status and oxidative stress parameters. It is

important to know whether doses that do not cause 
depletion of monoamines can elicit other toxic brain
changes. Several studies found transient changes in ATP
brain levels following amphetamines exposure, namely
MDMA or methamphetamine (METH). In fact, 
amphetamines are known to promote changes in tricarboxylic
acid cycle’s enzymes function, inhibition of the 
complexes in mitochondrial electron transport chain and
overall interference with mitochondrial dynamics [40]. A
binge dose regimen of MDMA (4 × 10 mg/kg, every 2 h,
i.p.) with a total dose of 40 mg/kg found decreases in
the ATP levels in the striatum at time-points 1, 12 and
24 h, as well as in the hippocampus 12 h after MDMA
exposure [41]. A single METH dose of 5 mg/kg, i.p.,
caused a decline in ATP brain content in adolescent
Wistar rats (4 week old) 30 min after administration
[42]. The same authors also found that ATP brain levels
returned to control values 24 h following exposure to
the single METH dose [42]. Most likely there is a 
possible transitory effect in brain ATP levels caused by
MDMA, and the time frame may disclose that short 
periods following exposure a decrease in ATP levels occurs,
meanwhile longer periods following exposure ATP brain
levels can recover. Of note that only the frontal cortex
area showed a decrease in the ATP levels in the present
study. The involvement of this area in both memory and
decision-making is widely known, however it is unclear
whether this event is related with the impairment in
memory and learning abilities seen in young animals 
exposed to MDMA [7, 8]. Importantly, in humans, “ec-
stasy” use was related to altered brain activity patterns
during associative learning in the left dorsolateral

levels, in nanomol per mg of protein (nmol/mg protein), and the GSH/GSSG ratio
are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from six to seven
animals. Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for GSHt, GSSG, GSH
levels in the heart, kidneys and liver, and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the liver; and the

are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from six to seven
animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for the
protein carbonylation in the heart and liver, meanwhile the Mann-Whitney Rank
Sum test showed in the kidneys a tendency for a change in protein carbonylation
(p= 0.051 treatment vs. control). Results of ATP levels, in nmol per mg of protein
(nmol/mg protein), are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained
from seven animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were made using the

prefrontal cortex [13], an effect that we speculate to be
related to MDMA-induced energetic impairment in the
frontal cortex. More investigation is needed in 
adolescent animals to confirm the long-lasting effects of 
amphetamines in ATP brain levels.
The metabolism of MDMA is a known triggering factor
for the toxicity of this drug. The MDMA metabolites are
highly reactive and can evoke oxidative stress [1]. Several
studies showed that MDMA metabolites promote 
neurotoxic effects to laboratory animals [43, 44]. Moreover,
MDMA metabolites, N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (N-
Me-α-MeDA, 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine, HHMA)
and α-methyldopamine (α-MeDA, 3,4-dihydroxyampheta-
mine, HHA), induced neuronal death in cultured cells [26,
39, 45]. N-Me-α-MeDA and α-MeDA are important
MDMA metabolites that can be oxidized into 
ortho-quinones, and that enter a redox cycle-eliciting oxidative
stress [1]. Moreover, thioether MDMA metabolites were
shown to promote depletion of neuronal GSH and the
formation of quinoproteins in cultured neurons [26], and
the mixture of MDMA and its metabolites were shown
to impair mitochondrial fusion/fission equilibrium and
trafficking in cultured neurons [46]. Catechol MDMA 
metabolites were also shown to promote toxicity to 
cardio-myocytes [17] and to hepatocytes [47] in vitro. There are
other contributing factors for MDMA-induced 
oxidative stress, including monoamine neurotransmitters
metabolism by monoamine oxidase [27], and nitric
oxide formation leading to damaging reactive nitrogen
species [1].
Our paradigm of MDMA exposure elicited no 
oxidative stress related changes in the adolescent rat brain.
Other studies reported decreases in glutathione levels
[48] and increases in protein carbonylation [27] in the
rat brain after MDMA exposure. Major differences 
between the previously mentioned studies and the current
study are the use of higher doses, older animals, and 
different time-points at measurements. The lack of changes
in brain oxidative stress parameters following 
MDMA-induced hyperthermia confirms that hyperthermia 
induction per se is not a guarantee for MDMA-evoked
brain oxidative stress.
Regarding the oxidative stress related parameters 
evaluated in the liver, heart, and kidneys, we could only find
an increase in quinoproteins in the liver following
MDMA exposure. In fact, MDMA metabolism is 
primarily hepatic, and, as previously mentioned, promotes
the formation of catechol metabolites that can generate
protein-bound quinones. Moreover, in rat hepatocytes,
catechol MDMA metabolites promoted ortho-quinones
formation and oxidative stress [47]. The increase in liver
quinoprotein formation possibly reflects the 
contribution of MDMA metabolism and the formation of 
reactive metabolites, and reveals the higher susceptibility of
the liver to MDMA-evoked toxicity.
Using higher doses and older animals, others reported
decreases in glutathione levels. Following administration
of a high MDMA dose in a total of 160 mg/kg (20 mg/
kg, i.p., 2 daily doses for 4 days), authors found 
decreases in GSH levels in the rat liver 3 and 6 h following
MDMA, which were recovered after 7 days [20, 22]. The
heart of rats exposed to MDMA in a dose of 20 mg/kg,
i.p., showed a reduction in total GSH levels at the 6 h
time-point [22]. The fact that our low MDMA binge
dose did not elicit changes in GSH levels in the

Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities in the heart, kidneys and liver of adolescent rats
that received either saline or MDMA. Results of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities,
in fluorescent units per μg of protein (FU/μg protein), are presented as mean
± standard deviation, and were obtained from seven animals in each group.
Statistical comparisons were made using the t-test for the caspase-3 activity in
the liver, heart and kidneys and caspase-8 and -9 activities in the heart and
kidneys, and the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test for the caspase-8 and -9 
activities in the liver (*p <0.05 treatment vs. control)
peripheral organs 24 h following exposure, reveals that
GSH levels might not have been affected or that GSH
could decrease at early times of exposure but then 
recovered. Overall, moderate MDMA doses in rats do not
seem to elicit long lasting GSH and ATP decreases to
the peripheral organs.
Protein carbonylation increase was observed in the rat
liver 12 h following two doses of MDMA 10 mg/kg
administered orally with a 24 h interval [23]. Enhanced
carbonylation in the kidney has been associated with the
development of hypertension and kidney disease [49]. 
Importantly, MDMA administration was shown to increase
blood pressure in humans [36], as well as in laboratory 
animals [4]. In accordance, both the histological damage and
the trend for protein carbonylation increase that we found
in the kidneys reveal that this organ may be highly prone
to damage following MDMA.
Vascular alterations that we observed in the three
studied organs, including vascular congestion, after 
exposure to MDMA have been associated to the 
MDMA-elicited hyperthermic response [50]. In fact, other studies
reported vascular lesions in the peripheral organs as a
consequence of hyperthermia [51, 52]. The exposure of
Wistar rats to high temperature environments was 
previously shown to result in several vascular lesions in the
heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs of animals that can
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 12 of 14
possibly lead to functional organ failure [52]. Those 
effects were similar to the signs of damage observed in
our study. Halpin and co-workers reported 
morphological damages in the liver of rats 24 h after the 
treatment with METH. The referred morphological changes
were prevented when the hyperthermic response 
induced by the treatment with METH was blocked, 
suggesting that liver damage is possibly a consequence of
METH-induced hyperthermia [51]. Therefore, it can be
postulated that the hyperthermic response observed in
our experiment may have contributed to the observed
histological alterations. The liver may be an organ with
greater susceptibility to MDMA toxicity as indicated not
only by the tissue damage, but also because it was the only
to show an increase in quinoprotein formation. Of note,
that one of the most frequently reported damage promoted
by MDMA in humans is hepatotoxicity [18, 24, 25]. In fact,
MDMA liver metabolism and hyperthermia may cooperate
to render the liver very vulnerable to damage.
The lack of changes in the plasma levels of AST, ALT,
CK and CK-MB after MDMA exposure corroborates the
absence of necrosis in the heart and liver. Moreover, the 
absence of caspase activity increase in the organs proves the
lack of severe damage to the tissues, given that caspases are
important effectors of the apoptotic pathway [53]. The 
notable exception of caspase-8 activity in the liver, which 
revealed a significant decrease in MDMA-treated rats, might
be related to a repression of genes related to apoptosis. The
inhibition of caspase-8 activity has been observed in hepatic
cells through nitric oxide signalling [54]. In cultured rat
striated cardiac myocytes there was a repression of 
caspase-1 and caspase-8 genes following exposure to MDMA [55].
Using higher doses (20 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily during 4 days,
in a total dose of 160 mg/kg), hepatic necrosis with 
inflammatory infiltrate around hepatic vein and increases in AST
levels were found at the 6 h time-point [20]. The heart is
particularly susceptible to oxidative stress-related injuries
and amphetamines like MDMA evoke cardiotoxicity [56].
Exposure of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) to MDMA
binges (9 mg/kg, intravenous twice daily, for 4 days), a
neurotoxic dose regimen, showed that MDMA promoted
cardiac foci of inflammatory infiltrates, the presence of 
necrotic cells and/or disrupted cytoarchitecture [4]. Another
report in adult rats (200-250 g) after a single MDMA dose
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) showed myocardial necrosis and following
16 h the heart exhibited macrophagic monocytes around
the necrotic myocardial cells [22]. Our study used lower
MDMA doses in adolescent rats and drug exposed hearts
showed a particular vulnerability of the myocytes from the
sub-endocardic region. Reports from MDMA users 
following fatalities describe major organ changes, including
necrosis, oedema and inflammation [1, 24, 25]. These 
important human findings report a rather extreme scenario
following the course of MDMA intoxication. Our report
more reliably reproduces the hyperthermia seen in human
abusers and organ changes might be more similar to
those seen in adolescents.

Results
MDMA evoked hyperthermia, but no changes in body
weight, food or water intake
Three MDMA doses were given to the animals (each
dose 5 mg/kg i.p., every 2 h) and the first dose did not
cause significant changes in body temperature (Fig. 1).
After the second dose of MDMA, rats had a significantly
higher body temperature when compared to the control
group (p <0.0001). Temperature persisted significantly
higher for almost 2 h after the third dose in treated 
animals. The temperature of MDMA-treated animals never
surpassed 39 °C even after the third MDMA dose (Fig. 1).
The temperature was also measured 24 h post-MDMA
binge administration and no differences were observed
in the temperature among controls and MDMA-treated
rats (data not shown).
Recordings of body weight gain, food or water intake
before and 24 h after exposure showed no differences
among control and MDMA-treated rats (data not
shown). In fact, there was a slight decrease in the body
weight of animals in both groups, possibly as a result of
the animal stress due to the manipulation. The food
consumption was similar in both control and 
MDMA-treated animals. However, there was a tendency for an
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 6 of 14
increased water intake in animals that received MDMA,
but it was not statistically significant (data not shown).
Liver, heart and kidneys weights were not changed
Each core organ (liver, heart, kidneys, and brain) had
their weight registered and the weight ratio of each
organ was taken to brain weight. No significant 
differences were observed between MDMA-treated rats and
the control group for all collected organs (Table 1).
MDMA decreased ATP content in the frontal cortex
Twenty-four hours after MDMA exposure, ATP levels
showed no significant changes in cerebellum, 
hippocampus and striatum, as can be seen in Fig. 2a, b and d, 
respectively. Importantly, there was a significant decrease
in the ATP content of the frontal cortex of the 
MDMA-treated group (p = 0.007) (Fig. 2c).
No changes in oxidative stress related parameters in the
brain areas
There were no significant alterations in the levels of
GSHt, GSSG, GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio in the 
cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum of
treated rats when compared to controls (Table 2).
Moreover, MDMA had no influence on quinoprotein
levels in the brain areas. In cerebellum, hippocampus,
frontal cortex and striatum no differences were found
between controls and MDMA-treated animals regarding
quinoprotein levels (Table 2).
The levels of protein carbonylation in the cerebellum,
hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum are also 
presented in Table 2, and there were no significant 
alterations in protein carbonyl levels in the four brain areas
of treated animals.
No changes in plasma AST, ALT, CK-MB and CK levels
The plasma levels of CK, CK-MB, AST and ALT were
measured 24 h after exposure as biomarkers of liver,
heart or muscle integrity (Table 3). There were no 
significant differences in these parameters between control
and MDMA-treated animals. The ratio AST/ALT was
Liver weight/brain weight ratio, heart weight/brain weight ratio, and kidneys
weight/brain weight ratio of control and MDMA-treated rats. Results are 
presented as mean ± standard deviation, and were obtained from seven animals
in each group. The mean brain weight of control animals was 1.57 ± 0.04, and
of MDMA-treated was 1.63 ± 0.05. Statistical comparisons were made using the
t-test for the heart weight/brain weight ratio and the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum
test for the liver weight/brain weight ratio and kidneys weight/brain
weight ratio
also calculated, but no significant differences among
groups were found (data not shown).
MDMA promoted vacuolization, oedema and vascular
congestion in the peripheral organs
The qualitative histologic examination of peripheral
organs (liver, heart and kidneys) of control and 
MDMA-treated rats was performed by means of optical 
microscopy. Representative histological figures can be observed
in Fig. 3.
The control group showed a preserved liver tissue
structure (Fig. 3a). Livers of MDMA-treated rats 
presented a marked cellular vacuolization in the periportal
regions, and sinusoidal dilatation with periportal and
centrilobular vascular congestion (Fig. 3b). No necrotic
zones or interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration was
observed in either group.
In the histological analysis of the heart, both controls
(Fig. 3c) and MDMA-treated (Fig. 3d) animals revealed a
normal tissue organization without signs of necrosis or
interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration. MDMA exposed
animals presented random signs of cardiomyocyte oedema,
particularly in the sub-endocardic region (Fig. 3d).
The renal tissue organization remained preserved in
the control group (Fig. 3e). However, the 
MDMA-treated group presented scattered interstitial oedema,
detected by the enlarged space between the tubular
structures, and signs of vascular congestion (Fig. 3f ). No
necrotic zones or interstitial inflammatory cell 
infiltration was observed in either group.
GSH homeostasis unaffected in the liver, heart, and
kidneys
The levels of GSHt, GSSG, GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio
in the liver, heart and kidneys in both groups are 
included in Table 4. No differences were found for all
these parameters in the three organs, between control
and MDMA-treated animals.
ATP content was unchanged in the peripheral organs
ATP levels were measured in the liver, heart and 
kidneys, and no significant differences in the ATP content
were observed between control and MDMA-treated 
animals, as can be seen in Table 4.
Protein-bound quinones formation increased by MDMA in
the liver
In Fig. 4, the levels of protein-bound quinones (quinopro-
teins) in the liver, heart and kidneys of control and
MDMA-treated animals can be observed. There was a 
significant increase in hepatic quinoprotein levels in the
MDMA-treated group (p = 0.039) (Fig. 4a). No differences
were found regarding this parameter in the heart or 
kidneys when comparing both groups (Fig. 4b and c).
Teixeira-Gomes et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:28 Page 7 of 14
MDMA showed a tendency to increase protein
carbonylation in the kidneys
In Table 4 are presented the results of protein 
carbonylation in the liver, heart and kidneys in the two groups. No
significant differences were found in the levels of protein
carbonyls in the liver and heart between groups.
However, data showed a tendency for an increase
(p = 0.051) in protein carbonylation in the kidneys of
MDMA-treated rats, although not reaching statistical
significance.
Caspase-8 activity decreased in the liver, while caspase-3
and -9 activities remained unaltered
Data concerning the activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in
liver, heart, and kidneys in the two groups are presented
in Table 5. Caspase-8 activity significantly decreased in
the liver of MDMA-treated rats when compared to 
controls (p = 0.038). No differences were found in the 
activity of this protease either in heart or kidneys. The
activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 had no significant
alterations in all three organs following MDMA when
compared to the control group.
