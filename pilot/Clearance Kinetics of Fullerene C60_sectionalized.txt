MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of C60 suspension and aerosol. To prepare a stable C60
nanoparticle suspension without using chemical modification or organic
solvents, C60 (nanom purple, refined by sublimation, C60 purity > 99.5%,
specific surface area 0.92 m2/g; Frontier Carbon Co. Ltd, Japan) in an aqueous
solution of 0.1% Tween 80 (MP Biomedicals LLC) was pulverized and
dispersed in an Ultra Apex Mill (UAM-015; Kotobuki Industries Co. Ltd,
Japan) according to previously described methods (Endoh et al., 2009;
Shinohara et al., 2009). The GMs of particle diameter were measured by using
a dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique (UPA, NIKKISO Co. Ltd, Japan).
Assuming a lognormal distribution of particle diameter and spherical form of
particle, these values were calculated as 18-23, 29-35, and 24-30 nm based on
number, volume (weight), and surface area, respectively. The geometric
standard deviation (GSD) of the distribution of the diameter was 1.5. However,
it must be noted that the distribution data obtained by DLS are less reliable. The
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. The f potentials of the aqueous suspension
measured by the same instrument were -28 to -30 mV. Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) image of the suspension are shown in Figures 1a and 1b.
C60 aerosol was prepared using a C60 suspension and a nebulizer by using
a previously described procedure (Shimada et al., 2009). The size distribution
and number (concentration) of aerosol particles in the exposure chamber were
measured using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and a condensation
particle counter (model 1000XP, WPS; MSP Corp.) and were found to be 96 nm
(GM; GSD, 2.0 [GM and GSD of particle diameter based on number] Table 1)
and 4.13 104 particles per cubic centimeter, respectively. The arithmetic mean ±
SD in-chamber mass concentration was obtained by weighing the sampling filter
and performing thermogravimetry and elemental carbon organic carbon analysis
aMeasured data from DLS (suspension) and DMA (aerosol). Note that the
GSD data from DLS have low reliability.

and was found to be 0.12 ± 0.03 mg/m3 (Morimoto et al., 2010). Because the
aerosol particles are composed of 25% crystalline fullerene and 75% Tween 80
(Shimada et al., 2009), the density of each aerosol particle was calculated as
1.2 mg/cm3. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the C60 aerosol
particles electrostatically sampled on a silicon wafer is shown in Figure 1c.
C60 instillation and inhalation. C60 particles (GM of diameter based on
volume: 29-35 nm) suspended in 0.4 ml distilled water at the following doses
were intratracheally instilled into male Wistar rats (age, 9 weeks): 100 lg
(330 lg/kg body weight), 200 lg (660 lg/kg body weight), and 1000 lg
(3300 lg/kg body weight). An aqueous solution of 0.1% Tween 80 was
intratracheally instilled in 36 control rats. In each of the above four groups
based on the concentration used, six rats each were dissected at 18 h (except for
the 100-lg group), 3 days (only in the case of the 1000-lg group), 1 week,
1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the instillation.
For inhalation exposure, six 9-week-old male Wistar rats were exposed to
C60 particles (mean ± SD dose, 120 ± 30 lg/m3; concentration, 4.1 3 104
particles per cubic centimeter; GM of diameter based on number, 96 nm) in
whole-body exposure chamber (volume, 0.52 m3) for 6 h/day and 5 days/week
for 4 weeks. The control rats were exposed to only clean air in a same-sized
chamber located in the same air-conditioned room. The rats were dissected
3 days and 1 month after the 4-week exposure period.
All procedures were conducted and all animals were handled according to
the guidelines in the Japanese Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, University of
Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, or by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
and Technology.
The preparation of the suspension, the exposure system, and the toxicity
tests have been reported in detail in Endoh et al. (2009), Shimada et al. (2009),
and Morimoto et al. (2010), respectively.
Analysis. Six rats in each group were anesthetized with an ip injection of
pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), weighed, and dissected. In the dissection, each organ
was perfused with saline after the blood drawing from the abdominal aora. The
left lung, liver, and brain of five rats in each group were dissected, weighed,
and cut into small pieces with scissors. The pieces were homogenized with
three times their weight of saline in an electric homogenizer (Polytron RT3100;
Kinematica AG, Switzerland) at 10 krpm and stored at 80C until analysis.
The determination of C60 in the organs of a rat was performed by LC-UV
combined with a procedure of extraction from tissue sample and concentration
of C60 in the extracted solution. The principle of the extraction procedure of C60
from tissue sample is similar to those of previous study (Kubota et al., 2009;
Moussa et al., 1997) but was optimized for our exposure sample, and
a concentration procedure of the extracted C60 was added after the extraction.
SDS (0.01M, 0.5 ml), acetic acid (0.1M, 0.5 ml), and toluene (HPLC grade,
5 ml) (all from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Japan) were added to 200 mg of
homogenized tissue samples. The resultant mixture was shaken for 5 h in
a shaker (SA300; Yamato Scientific Co. Ltd, Japan) and sonicated for 15 min in
an ultrasonic bath (model 1510; Branson Ultrasonics Co.). The mixture was
then centrifuged (Kubota 6900; Kubota Co., Japan) at 2000 3 g for 10 min to
separate the toluene solution, and the supernatant was collected in a test tube.
The residue was shaken for 15 min with 5 ml toluene, sonicated for 15 min, and
separated by centrifugation; the supernatant was collected in a test tube. The
residue was shaken for 2 min with 2 ml toluene, sonicated for 15 min, and
separated by centrifugation; the supernatant was collected in a test tube. Then
1 ml of toluene was gently added to the residue, and the supernatant toluene
was collected in a test tube twice. Approximately 14 ml of the extracted toluene
solutions (supernatants) in the test tubes were filtered with 0.2-lm filter
(polytetrafluoroethylene filter media with polypropylene housing, Whatman
Ltd, U.K.) to prevent the HPLC column from clogging by pieces of rat tissue,
which are present at the water-toluene interface and concentrated to 0.20 ml
with 0.4 ml/min of
N2 gas at 40C by using a nitrogen concentration system
(EVAN-SPE; Moritex Co., Japan).
The extracted and concentrated
C60 and fullerene oxide (Carbon sixty oxide
[C60O]) were analyzed using an HPLC system (Shimadzu LC-10A system;
Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with a UV detector (wavelength, 333 nm). The
mobile phase was 70% (vol/vol) toluene and 30% acetonitrile (vol/vol) (Wako
Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd) with a flow rate of 0.425 ml/min. The analyte (9.0 ll)
was injected into a reverse phase triacontylsilyl silica (C30) packed column
(particle size, 5 lm; internal diameter, 3.0 3 150 mm; Develosil RP Fullerene;
Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd, Japan), which was maintained at 30C.
After
C60 instillation, lung tissues of the rats were observed through an
energy-filtering TEM (EM922; Carl Zeiss SMT, Germany) equipped with an
OMEGA energy filter. The specimen for TEM was prepared as follows. Lung
tissues were fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide solution, dehydrated
in ethanol, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut using
a diamond knife microtome. Some of the specimens were stained with 2%
uranyl acetate solution and 0.5% lead citrate solution at room temperature.
Quality assurance. The detection and quantification of limits (QOL) were
defined to be 3r and 10r of the noise level. The precision of analysis
(repeatability) was checked using a standard solution of 0.024 lg/ml C60 in
toluene (N ¼ 5) and using lung tissue sample of 17 lg/g tissue C60. To
determine the efficiency of recovery, an aqueous suspension of C60
nanoparticles was spiked onto 200 mg of the lung tissues at average levels in
the real samples (12-44 lg of C60), the liver tissues at equal amount and
10 times amount of QOL (0.032-0.35 lg of C60), and the brain tissues at equal
amount and 10 times amount of QOL (0.038-0.41 lg of C60) of rats.
To confirm whether the instilled suspension had evenly spread to both sides
of the lung after intratracheal instillation, 10, 200, and 1000 lg of C60
nanoparticles in 0.4 ml distilled water were intratracheally instilled into 
9-week-old male Wistar rats. At 1 h after the instillation, six rats in each group
were dissected, their right and left lungs were weighed, and the concentration of
C60 in both lungs was measured.
Deposition fraction and clearance rate constants of C60. The clearance

the alveolar surface are mainly phagocytized by macrophages, transferred to the
tracheobronchial region, and cleared via the sputum (Lehnert and Morrow,
1985a,b). Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is responsible for rapid
clearance. Some of the deposited particles penetrate the epithelial cell barrier
and enter the epithelial cells and some penetrate the pulmonary interstitium and
are slowly cleared from the lung via the lymph nodes. These pathways are
responsible for slow clearance via compartment 2. The above mechanisms can
be represented by a 2-step decay rate as shown in Equations 1 and 2:
dA ¼ CVf  k1A k12A;
ð1Þ
dt
dI ¼ k12A k2I
dt
ð2Þ
ðt ¼ 0 : A ¼ A0; I ¼ I0Þ;
a 2-compartment model (Fig. 2) described in a previous study (Kuempel et al.,
2001). Inhaled airborne particles are deposited on the alveolar surface,
depending on their size. The amount of deposited particles is equivalent to the
pulmonary burden in compartment 1. Two clearance pathways, namely, direct
clearance from the lung (rapid clearance) and clearance via compartment 2
(slow clearance), were assumed to operate in this model. Particles deposited on
where A is the C60 burden in lung compartment 1 (micrograms), C is
exposure concentration (micrograms per cubic meter), V is inhalation rate
(cubic meter per day), f is the deposition fraction, I is the C60 burden in lung
compartment 2 (micrograms), A0 is the initial C60 burden in lung compartment 1
(micrograms), I0 is the initial C60 burden in lung compartment 2 (micrograms),
and k1, k12, and k2 are the clearance rate constants for rapid clearance (per day),
translocation from compartments 1-2, and slow clearance, respectively.
In the case of C60 instillation, A0, C, V, and I0 were the instillation doses
(100, 200, and 1000 lg), 0 lg/m3, 0.27 m3/day, and 0 lg, respectively. In the
case of C60 inhalation, A0, C, V, and I0 for the nth exposure period were the
burden in compartment 1 at the end of the (n  1)th nonexposure period an1,
120 lg/m3 and 0.27 m3/day, and the burden in compartment 2 at the end of the
(n  1)th nonexposure period in1, respectively, and those for the nth
nonexposure period were the burden in compartment 1 at the end of nth
exposure period a#n, 0 lg/m3 and 0.27 m3/day, and the burden in compartment
2 at the end of nth exposure period i#n, respectively. The inhalation rate of
Wistar rats (300 g), 0.27 m3/day, was calculated from an equation given in
a previous study (Bide et al., 2000) for rats with an average body weight of
300 g. The decay equations for A and I were derived from Equations 1 and 2 by
using Laplace transformation.
The pulmonary C60 burden was assumed to equal the sum of the C60 burden
in compartments 1 and 2 (A þ I). The clearance rate constants k1, k12, and k2
were estimated by fitting the decay curve of (A þ I) to the lung burden
measured after C60 instillation by using the least squares method with the solver
function in Microsoft Excel 2003. The deposited fraction f was estimated by
fitting the decay curve of (A þ I) to the measured pulmonary burden after C60
inhalation by using the least squares method with the solver function in
Microsoft Excel 2003, assuming that the clearance behavior of the inhaled
particles was the same as that of the injected particles because the replacement
of Tween 80 by biosurfactant could deagglomerate the inhaled agglomerated
particles into the primary particles in the rat lung.

Fullerene (carbon sixty [C60]) has potential industrial and medical
applications. In the future, people working in or residing near
manufacturing facilities may be exposed to C60. Therefore,
quantitative data on long-term C60 clearance from the lungs are
required. To estimate the clearance rate and deposition fraction of
C60 from inhalation exposure, the C60 burden in the lungs, liver, and
brain of rats was determined after intratracheal instillation and
inhalation. Male Wistar rats were intratracheally instilled with
different concentrations of a C60 suspension prepared with Tween
80 (geometric mean [GM] of particle diameter based on number, 
18-29 nm; geometric standard deviation [GSD] of particle diameter, 1.5;
and doses, 100, 200, and 1000 micrograms per body) or exposed to
a C60 aerosol prepared with nebulizer (GM of particle diameter
based on number, 96 nm; GSD of particle diameter, 2.0; and
exposure level, 120 mg/m3). C60 burden in the lungs, liver, and brain
was determined at various time points (1 h to 6 months) by a newly
developed sensitive high-performance liquid 
chromatography-ultraviolet absorptiometry combined with extraction and 
concentration of C60 from the organs. C60 clearance was evaluated using a
2-compartment model: fast clearance after deposition on lung surface
and slow clearance after retention in the epithelium. The detection
limit of our analysis method was 8.9 ng/g tissue. Pulmonary C60
burden decreased with time and depended on the C60 concentration
administered. The concentration of C60 in the liver and brain was
below the detection limit: 8.9 ng/g tissue. The half-life of 
intratracheally instilled C60 was 15-28 days. The deposition mass fraction
of inhaled C60 was 0.14. Mode evaluation revealed that most instilled
particles could be eliminated by the fast clearance pathway. This
finding is consistent with the transmission electron microscopy
finding that many particles were present in alveolar macrophages.

Fullerene, carbon sixty (C60), possesses unique 
physicochemical properties and is a candidate molecule for many
industrial and medical nanotechnology applications, such as
energy conversion and drug delivery. In the future, people
working in or residing near manufacturing facilities may be
exposed to airborne C60 particles.
Upon inhalation, some of these particles are deposited in the
alveoli, depending on the particle size/shape/density, animal
species, and breathing pattern. Fluid-flow models such as the
multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model have been
developed to estimate the deposition fraction of spherical particles
in rats and humans (RIVM, 2002). The deposition fractions for
rats, calculated using the MPPD model, were 0.2-0.3 for 10- to
100-nm particles and 0.05-0.2 for 100- to 1000-nm particles.
In Fischer 344 rats, the deposition fraction was greater for C60
nanoparticles (0.14 for 55-nm particles) than for C60
microparticles (0.093 for 930-nm particles) (Baker et al., 2008).
The rate clearance of carbon black particles from the lungs
was increased with the primary particle size (14-70 nm) though
the secondary particle size was similar (geometric mean [GM]:
1.4-1.6 lm) (Elder et al., 2005). The main clearance pathway
of particulate matter deposited on the alveolar surface is
phagocytosis by the alveolar macrophages followed by 
transport to the larynx (Lehnert and Morrow, 1985a,b; Naumann
and Schlesinger, 1986). Some particles are transferred to the
pulmonary interstitium and/or epithelial cells. Total pulmonary
retention and translocation to the pulmonary interstitium are
significantly greater for ultrafine titanium dioxide (TiO2)
particles than for fine TiO2 particles in rats (Oberdo¨rster
et al., 1994). The size of C60 nanoparticles in the test
suspension is very important in toxicity evaluations; however,
the size of the test samples used has not been described in
sufficient detail in most studies on the disposition of C60. In the
Japanese New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organization project, stable dispersion and stable aerosol of
C60 nanoparticles (Endoh et al., 2009; Shimada et al., 2009)
were successfully prepared and were applied to the pulmonary
toxicity tests (Morimoto et al., 2010).
IP administered C60 particles are not detected in the brain,
whereas ip or iv administered particles are detected in the liver
and spleen (Bullard-Dillard et al., 1996; Gharbi et al., 2005;
Moussa et al., 1996). In rats, iv administered C60 is rapidly
cleared from the circulation (within 1 min), largely 
accumulated in the liver (90-95%), and retained in the liver for more
than 120 h (Bullard-Dillard et al., 1996). Naota et al. (2009)
microscopically examined aggregated C60 particles in the
lumina of pulmonary capillaries and in pulmonary lymph
nodes 5 min after intratracheal C60 instillation. The 
translocation of inhaled particles from the lung to the 
extrapulmonary organs has been reported to be small (< 1%, Kreyling
et al., 2002; < 0.5%, Mo¨ller et al., 2008). However,
Oberdo¨rster et al. (2004) reported that inhaled ultrafine 13C
particles may be translocated to the brain (cerebrum and
cerebellum) via the olfactory bulb.
Quantitative data on long-term C60 clearance have not yet
been reported. Furthermore, although C60 has not been detected
in brain tissue after exposure to these particles, the detection
limit of the analytical methods used in previous studies was not
sufficiently low. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether
C60 nanoparticles are retained in the lung or translocated to the
other organs and to determine the severity of the adverse
effects of the retained particles on the basis of previous results.
Highly sensitive analytical methods are required to detect the
translocation of C60 to extrapulmonary organs, especially the
brain, because unlike gaseous chemicals nanoparticles cannot
be maintained at steadily high concentrations during inhalation
experiments. Kubota et al. (2009) and Moussa et al. (1997)
used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which are better
than radioisotope analysis for the quantification of C60, to
determine the concentration of intravital C60. The 
determination limit of these methods is 1.1 lg/g tissue (Kubota et al.,
2009). Considering the general weight of brain (approximately
2 g), the transfer to brain cannot be detected unless more than
a few percentage of the lung burden of C60 translocate to the
brain even at high concentration such as 2 mg/m3. Therefore, to
evaluate the possibility of translocation of nanoparticle to the
brain reported by Oberdo¨rster et al. (2004), this limit is
inadequate and more sensitive analytical methods are required.
In addition, long-term clearance of C60 from the lung is
difficult to measure because of the low C60 burden in the lungs
in the inhalation exposure test. Therefore, in this study, we
evaluated long-term C60 clearance by using intratracheal C60
instillation because this method results in a considerably
greater pulmonary C60 burden than C60 inhalation.
In this study, we aimed to determine the deposition,
clearance, and translocation of C60 nanoparticles by conducting
CLEARANCE KINETICS OF FULLERENE C60 NANOPARTICLES

the following experiments: (1) development of a highly
sensitive method involving sample concentration and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet (UV)
detection for the analysis of C60 in biological samples; (2)
determination of C60 burden in the lung, liver, and brain until
6 months after intratracheal C60 instillation and until 1 month
after C60 inhalation; and (3) estimation of the clearance rate and
deposition fraction of C60 nanoparticles based on the results of
these determinations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of C60 suspension and aerosol. To prepare a stable C60
nanoparticle suspension without using chemical modification or organic
solvents, C60 (nanom purple, refined by sublimation, C60 purity > 99.5%,
specific surface area 0.92 m2/g; Frontier Carbon Co. Ltd, Japan) in an aqueous
solution of 0.1% Tween 80 (MP Biomedicals LLC) was pulverized and
dispersed in an Ultra Apex Mill (UAM-015; Kotobuki Industries Co. Ltd,
Japan) according to previously described methods (Endoh et al., 2009;
Shinohara et al., 2009). The GMs of particle diameter were measured by using
a dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique (UPA, NIKKISO Co. Ltd, Japan).
Assuming a lognormal distribution of particle diameter and spherical form of
particle, these values were calculated as 18-23, 29-35, and 24-30 nm based on
number, volume (weight), and surface area, respectively. The geometric
standard deviation (GSD) of the distribution of the diameter was 1.5. However,
it must be noted that the distribution data obtained by DLS are less reliable. The
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. The f potentials of the aqueous suspension
measured by the same instrument were -28 to -30 mV. Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) image of the suspension are shown in Figures 1a and 1b.
C60 aerosol was prepared using a C60 suspension and a nebulizer by using
a previously described procedure (Shimada et al., 2009). The size distribution
and number (concentration) of aerosol particles in the exposure chamber were
measured using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and a condensation
particle counter (model 1000XP, WPS; MSP Corp.) and were found to be 96 nm
(GM; GSD, 2.0 [GM and GSD of particle diameter based on number] Table 1)
and 4.13 104 particles per cubic centimeter, respectively. The arithmetic mean ±
SD in-chamber mass concentration was obtained by weighing the sampling filter
and performing thermogravimetry and elemental carbon organic carbon analysis
aMeasured data from DLS (suspension) and DMA (aerosol). Note that the
GSD data from DLS have low reliability.

and was found to be 0.12 ± 0.03 mg/m3 (Morimoto et al., 2010). Because the
aerosol particles are composed of 25% crystalline fullerene and 75% Tween 80
(Shimada et al., 2009), the density of each aerosol particle was calculated as
1.2 mg/cm3. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the C60 aerosol
particles electrostatically sampled on a silicon wafer is shown in Figure 1c.
C60 instillation and inhalation. C60 particles (GM of diameter based on
volume: 29-35 nm) suspended in 0.4 ml distilled water at the following doses
were intratracheally instilled into male Wistar rats (age, 9 weeks): 100 lg
(330 lg/kg body weight), 200 lg (660 lg/kg body weight), and 1000 lg
(3300 lg/kg body weight). An aqueous solution of 0.1% Tween 80 was
intratracheally instilled in 36 control rats. In each of the above four groups
based on the concentration used, six rats each were dissected at 18 h (except for
the 100-lg group), 3 days (only in the case of the 1000-lg group), 1 week,
1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the instillation.
For inhalation exposure, six 9-week-old male Wistar rats were exposed to
C60 particles (mean ± SD dose, 120 ± 30 lg/m3; concentration, 4.1 3 104
particles per cubic centimeter; GM of diameter based on number, 96 nm) in
whole-body exposure chamber (volume, 0.52 m3) for 6 h/day and 5 days/week
for 4 weeks. The control rats were exposed to only clean air in a same-sized
chamber located in the same air-conditioned room. The rats were dissected
3 days and 1 month after the 4-week exposure period.
All procedures were conducted and all animals were handled according to
the guidelines in the Japanese Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, University of
Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, or by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
and Technology.
The preparation of the suspension, the exposure system, and the toxicity
tests have been reported in detail in Endoh et al. (2009), Shimada et al. (2009),
and Morimoto et al. (2010), respectively.
Analysis. Six rats in each group were anesthetized with an ip injection of
pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), weighed, and dissected. In the dissection, each organ
was perfused with saline after the blood drawing from the abdominal aora. The
left lung, liver, and brain of five rats in each group were dissected, weighed,
and cut into small pieces with scissors. The pieces were homogenized with
three times their weight of saline in an electric homogenizer (Polytron RT3100;
Kinematica AG, Switzerland) at 10 krpm and stored at 80C until analysis.
The determination of C60 in the organs of a rat was performed by LC-UV
combined with a procedure of extraction from tissue sample and concentration
of C60 in the extracted solution. The principle of the extraction procedure of C60
from tissue sample is similar to those of previous study (Kubota et al., 2009;
Moussa et al., 1997) but was optimized for our exposure sample, and
a concentration procedure of the extracted C60 was added after the extraction.
SDS (0.01M, 0.5 ml), acetic acid (0.1M, 0.5 ml), and toluene (HPLC grade,
5 ml) (all from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Japan) were added to 200 mg of
homogenized tissue samples. The resultant mixture was shaken for 5 h in
a shaker (SA300; Yamato Scientific Co. Ltd, Japan) and sonicated for 15 min in
an ultrasonic bath (model 1510; Branson Ultrasonics Co.). The mixture was
then centrifuged (Kubota 6900; Kubota Co., Japan) at 2000 3 g for 10 min to
separate the toluene solution, and the supernatant was collected in a test tube.
The residue was shaken for 15 min with 5 ml toluene, sonicated for 15 min, and
separated by centrifugation; the supernatant was collected in a test tube. The
residue was shaken for 2 min with 2 ml toluene, sonicated for 15 min, and
separated by centrifugation; the supernatant was collected in a test tube. Then
1 ml of toluene was gently added to the residue, and the supernatant toluene
was collected in a test tube twice. Approximately 14 ml of the extracted toluene
solutions (supernatants) in the test tubes were filtered with 0.2-lm filter
(polytetrafluoroethylene filter media with polypropylene housing, Whatman
Ltd, U.K.) to prevent the HPLC column from clogging by pieces of rat tissue,
which are present at the water-toluene interface and concentrated to 0.20 ml
with 0.4 ml/min of
N2 gas at 40C by using a nitrogen concentration system
(EVAN-SPE; Moritex Co., Japan).
The extracted and concentrated
C60 and fullerene oxide (Carbon sixty oxide
[C60O]) were analyzed using an HPLC system (Shimadzu LC-10A system;
Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with a UV detector (wavelength, 333 nm). The
mobile phase was 70% (vol/vol) toluene and 30% acetonitrile (vol/vol) (Wako
Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd) with a flow rate of 0.425 ml/min. The analyte (9.0 ll)
was injected into a reverse phase triacontylsilyl silica (C30) packed column
(particle size, 5 lm; internal diameter, 3.0 3 150 mm; Develosil RP Fullerene;
Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd, Japan), which was maintained at 30C.
After
C60 instillation, lung tissues of the rats were observed through an
energy-filtering TEM (EM922; Carl Zeiss SMT, Germany) equipped with an
OMEGA energy filter. The specimen for TEM was prepared as follows. Lung
tissues were fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide solution, dehydrated
in ethanol, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut using
a diamond knife microtome. Some of the specimens were stained with 2%
uranyl acetate solution and 0.5% lead citrate solution at room temperature.
Quality assurance. The detection and quantification of limits (QOL) were
defined to be 3r and 10r of the noise level. The precision of analysis
(repeatability) was checked using a standard solution of 0.024 lg/ml C60 in
toluene (N ¼ 5) and using lung tissue sample of 17 lg/g tissue C60. To
determine the efficiency of recovery, an aqueous suspension of C60
nanoparticles was spiked onto 200 mg of the lung tissues at average levels in
the real samples (12-44 lg of C60), the liver tissues at equal amount and
10 times amount of QOL (0.032-0.35 lg of C60), and the brain tissues at equal
amount and 10 times amount of QOL (0.038-0.41 lg of C60) of rats.
To confirm whether the instilled suspension had evenly spread to both sides
of the lung after intratracheal instillation, 10, 200, and 1000 lg of C60
nanoparticles in 0.4 ml distilled water were intratracheally instilled into 
9-week-old male Wistar rats. At 1 h after the instillation, six rats in each group
were dissected, their right and left lungs were weighed, and the concentration of
C60 in both lungs was measured.
Deposition fraction and clearance rate constants of C60. The clearance
of inhaled C60 particles from the lung was assumed to resemble

the alveolar surface are mainly phagocytized by macrophages, transferred to the
tracheobronchial region, and cleared via the sputum (Lehnert and Morrow,
1985a,b). Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages is responsible for rapid
clearance. Some of the deposited particles penetrate the epithelial cell barrier
and enter the epithelial cells and some penetrate the pulmonary interstitium and
are slowly cleared from the lung via the lymph nodes. These pathways are
responsible for slow clearance via compartment 2. The above mechanisms can
be represented by a 2-step decay rate as shown in Equations 1 and 2:

ð1Þ
dt
dI ¼ k12A k2I

ðt ¼ 0 : A ¼ A0; I ¼ I0Þ;
a 2-compartment model (Fig. 2) described in a previous study (Kuempel et al.,
2001). Inhaled airborne particles are deposited on the alveolar surface,
depending on their size. The amount of deposited particles is equivalent to the
pulmonary burden in compartment 1. Two clearance pathways, namely, direct
clearance from the lung (rapid clearance) and clearance via compartment 2
(slow clearance), were assumed to operate in this model. Particles deposited on
where A is the C60 burden in lung compartment 1 (micrograms), C is
exposure concentration (micrograms per cubic meter), V is inhalation rate
(cubic meter per day), f is the deposition fraction, I is the C60 burden in lung
compartment 2 (micrograms), A0 is the initial C60 burden in lung compartment 1
(micrograms), I0 is the initial C60 burden in lung compartment 2 (micrograms),
and k1, k12, and k2 are the clearance rate constants for rapid clearance (per day),
translocation from compartments 1-2, and slow clearance, respectively.
In the case of C60 instillation, A0, C, V, and I0 were the instillation doses
(100, 200, and 1000 lg), 0 lg/m3, 0.27 m3/day, and 0 lg, respectively. In the
case of C60 inhalation, A0, C, V, and I0 for the nth exposure period were the
burden in compartment 1 at the end of the (n  1)th nonexposure period an1,
120 lg/m3 and 0.27 m3/day, and the burden in compartment 2 at the end of the
(n  1)th nonexposure period in1, respectively, and those for the nth
nonexposure period were the burden in compartment 1 at the end of nth
exposure period a#n, 0 lg/m3 and 0.27 m3/day, and the burden in compartment
2 at the end of nth exposure period i#n, respectively. The inhalation rate of
Wistar rats (300 g), 0.27 m3/day, was calculated from an equation given in
a previous study (Bide et al., 2000) for rats with an average body weight of
300 g. The decay equations for A and I were derived from Equations 1 and 2 by
using Laplace transformation.
The pulmonary C60 burden was assumed to equal the sum of the C60 burden
in compartments 1 and 2 (A þ I). The clearance rate constants k1, k12, and k2
were estimated by fitting the decay curve of (A þ I) to the lung burden
measured after C60 instillation by using the least squares method with the solver
function in Microsoft Excel 2003. The deposited fraction f was estimated by
fitting the decay curve of (A þ I) to the measured pulmonary burden after C60
inhalation by using the least squares method with the solver function in
Microsoft Excel 2003, assuming that the clearance behavior of the inhaled
particles was the same as that of the injected particles because the replacement
of Tween 80 by biosurfactant could deagglomerate the inhaled agglomerated
particles into the primary particles in the rat lung.
RESULTS
Quality Assurance
Chromatograms of toluene solution, 100 and 7.1 ng/ml of
standard C60 solutions, and a standard C60O solution (100 ng/
ml) are shown in Figure 3a. The detection limit and QOL were
calculated to be 2.2 and 7.3 ng/ml for the standard solution,
respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the results
of repeated analyses of standard solution (N ¼ 5) was 1.8%.
Chromatograms of the extract from the lung tissue of
intratracheally instilled rat are shown in Figure 3b. The
detection limit and QOL were calculated to be 8.9 and 29 ng/g
568
tissue for the sample tissue, respectively. The RSD of the
results of repeated analysis of the tissue of C60 instilled rat
(N ¼ 3) was 3.0%. The mean ± SD efficiencies of C60 recovery
from the lung, liver, and brain tissues was 95 ± 5, 92 ± 10, and
94 ± 6%, respectively (Table 2).
The mean ± SD pulmonary C60 burdens (micrograms) 1 h
after the instillation were 12.4 ± 0.40, 220 ± 2.3, and 1100 ± 82
for the 10-, 200-, and 1000-lg doses, respectively. These show
that 110-120% of instilled amounts were determined in the
lungs. Thus, it was confirmed that most of the instilled C60
immediately reached the lung.
The ratio of the C60 burden in right or left lung to that in both
lungs 1 h after the instillation (right lung, 0.311-0.396; left
lung, 0.604-0.689) was almost identical to the ratio of the
weight of the right or left lung to that of both lungs (right lung,
0.343-0.357; left lung, 0.643-0.657), respectively (Table 3).
From these results, we concluded that the C60 burden after
intratracheal instillation did not differ between the right and left
lungs.
C60 Burden in the Lung, Liver, and Brain
A chromatogram of a sample solution extracted from the
lung tissue of a rat is shown in Figure 3b. The lung burdens
after instillation are shown in Table 4. After the instillation of
SHINOHARA ET AL.
100 lg C60, the mean ± SD C60 burdens in the entire lung
(micrograms per lung) at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months were
70.8 ± 14, 26.5 ± 15, 5.22 ± 0.45, and 2.86 ± 2.0, respectively.
In the case of the 200-lg dose, the pulmonary C60 burdens at
18 h and 1, 3, and 6 months were 210 ± 9.0, 62.3 ± 30, 17.3 ±
5.0, and 14.9 ± 3.1, respectively. In the case of the 1000-lg
dose, the pulmonary C60 burden at 18 h, 3 days, 1 week, and 1,
3, and 6 months were 1000 ± 170, 1000 ± 160, 1180 ± 180,
481 ± 79, 91.4 ± 25, and 22.0 ± 6.3, respectively. C60 was not
detected in the liver and brain after the instillation (detection
limit, 0.0089 lg/g tissue). Thus, if C60 translocation to
extrapulmonary organs does occur, the amount translocated
to the liver (< 0.20 lg/liver) and brain (< 0.020 lg/brain) were
confirmed to be < 0.2 and 0.02% of the instillation dose,
respectively. TEM images of the alveolar macrophages in the
lungs of rats at 1 week after the instillation of 0.2 milligrams
per body are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a is a 
low-magnification image of alveolar macrophages. Indicated arrow
shown in Figure 4a is phagosome in the alveolar macrophage.
Magnified image of phagosome in alveolar macrophage was
shown in Figure 4b. Many black particles resembling fullerene
particles are seen in the phagosome. These particles were
identified as C60 particles because high-resolution images
(Fig. 4c) show (111) lattice plane of crystalline fullerene. TEM
images of the alveolar macrophages in the lungs of rats at
6 months after the instillation of 0.2 milligrams per body were
shown in Figure 4d. It is difficult to see the fullerene particles
in the alveolar macrophages at 6 months after the instillation.
We think that most of fullerene particles are exhausted. C60
nanoparticles were also observed in the cytoplasm of the
epithelial cells of the lung. We could not, however, confirm
their presence in the pulmonary interstitium.
The lung burdens after inhalation exposure are shown in
Table 5. The mean ± SD pulmonary
C60 burdens (micrograms
per lung) 3 days and 1 month after the inhalation experiment
were 9.92 ± 2.2 and 5.36 ± 1.2, respectively. C60 was not
detected in the liver and brain after inhalation exposure
(detection limit, 0.0089 lg/g tissue). The TEM images of the
alveolar macrophages in the lungs of rats at 3 days after
inhalation exposure are shown in Figure 5. Phagosomes were

instillation. Few fullerene particles can be seen.
The pulmonary C60 burden after the inhalation experiment
was also estimated using the 2-step decay rate equation.
Assuming that the clearance behavior of the inhaled particles
was the same as that of the injected particles and by fitting the
decay curves of the estimated pulmonary C60 burden using the
clearance rate constants for the rats administered 100 lg C60 to
the measured pulmonary C60 burden, the deposition fraction of
C60 particles (GM and GSD of particle diameter based on
number, 96 nm and 2.0, respectively) after inhalation was
estimated to be 0.14. The measured data and fitting curve are
shown in Figure 6b.
Except C60, three compounds (C60O [retention time {RT} ¼
7.6 min], peak A [RT ¼ 40.5 min], peak B [RT ¼ 49.6 min])
were observed in the extract of the lung tissue of intratracheally
instilled rat (Fig. 3b). Peak A and peak B could not be
identified. The ratio of C60O/C60 concentration increased from
2.2% at 3 days after the instillation to 5.0% at 3 months after
the instillation; the ratio of C60O/C60 concentration in the C60
suspension was 2.6% (Fig. 7a). The ratio of an unidentified
compound (peak A in Fig. 3b) to the C60 area also increased
during 3 months (Fig. 7b). However, the ratio of another
unidentified compound (peak B in Fig. 3b) to the C60 area
decreased during 6 months (Fig. 7c).
observed in the alveolar macrophages and (111) lattice plane of
crystalline fullerene.
Clearance Rate Constant and Deposition Fraction of C60
By fitting the decay curves of the pulmonary C60 burden
estimated using a 2-step decay rate equation (Equations 1 and 2)
until 6 months after instillation to the measured pulmonary C60
burden, we obtained the clearance rate constants k1, k12, and k2
to be 0.029-0.047, 0.00044-0.0034, and 0-0.0042 per day,
respectively (Table 6). The measured data and fitting curve are
shown in Figure 6a. On the basis of the decay rate equations, we
calculated the half-life and 90% decay period as 15, 17, and
28 days and 58, 77, and 87 days for 100, 200, and 1000 lg
administration, respectively. The deposition fraction of C60
particles in the intratracheal instillation was assumed to be
100%; this was confirmed on the basis of the mean pulmonary
C60 burden (micrograms) at 1 h after the instillation in the
quality assurance tests.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, the extraction and concentration
procedure of C60 from tissue improved the QOL to be
considerably lower levels of intravital
C60 (0.029 lg/g tissue)
than those measured in a previous study (1.1 lg/g tissue;
Kubota et al., 2009). The low QOL of our method enabled the
evaluation of long-term
C60 clearance (at 6 months and 1 year)
when the amount of pulmonary
C60 burden was small. The
precision and recovery with this method were also adequate to
determine the C60 mass burden.
In terms of the deposition fraction of
C60 particle, Baker
et al. (2008) reported that the deposition fraction (count median
diameter of
C60 particles, 55 nm; GSD, 1.48) was 0.14. This
value is possible to be an underestimation because their study
did not take into account
C60 clearance during exposure. The
deposition fraction of
C60 nanoparticle obtained in their
inhalation test was reanalyzed using the clearance rate
constants obtained in this study and the inhalation rate reported
in the study of Baker et al. (2008), 140 ml/min, and found this
fraction to be 0.18 (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the underestimation
was considered to be negligible. In addition, the deposition
fractions of particles with median diameters of 55 nm
(GSD, 1.48; density, 1.7 g/cm3) and 96 nm (GSD, 2.0; density,
1.2 g/cm3) were estimated using an MPPD model with the
following parameters: model in MPPD, Asymn Multipath;
breathing frequency of rat, 102 breaths per minute; tidal
volume of rat, 1.37 ml (Fischer 344 rats) or 1.84 ml (Wistar
rats); and breathing type, nasal. In the present study, the
deposition fractions of the C60 nanoparticles (diameters, 55 and
96 nm) were estimated to be 0.18 and 0.14, respectively, which
were higher than those calculated using the MPPD model for
spherical particles (0.12 and 0.078, respectively). In the present
study, the clearance rates were assumed to be same as that
during the instillation test (GM, 31 nm), regardless of the
particle size. The clearance rates of smaller particles (GM,
31 nm) are higher than those of larger particles (GM, 55 and
96 nm); this difference can be explained. By using the
deposition fraction calculated using the MPPD model, k1 for
the 55- and 96-nm particles were approximately 1/10 of the k1
for the 31-nm particle. According to previous studies (Madl
et al., 1998; Oberdo¨rster et al., 1994), the clearance rate of
smaller particles might be lower than that of larger particles,
but it cannot be higher than that of larger particles. Thus, this
difference might be because of a reason other than the
assumption regarding different clearance rates among different
particle size. It may be because a small number of large
particles have a skewed lognormal distribution in the MPPD
model; such particles were not present in the air used for
experimental exposure because the deposition fraction of these
large particles is small. Thus, of models such as MPPD may
lead to the over- or underestimation of deposition fractions if
the particle size distribution is not carefully selected.
Xu et al. (2007) reported that nonaqueous C60(OH)x (x ¼ 22
or 24) nanoparticles were not detected in the brains of rats that
were intratracheally instilled with C60 particles-a finding
similar to that of the present study. In contrast, Oberdo¨rster
et al. (2004) concluded that in rats, inhaled nanoparticles
deposited on the nasal mucosa are translocated to the brain via
the olfactory bulb because they detected 13C in the olfactory
bulb, cerebellum, and cerebrum until 7 days after inhalation
exposure (for 6 h) to 13C-labeled carbon nanoparticles (count
median diameter, 37 nm; GSD, 1.66; concentration, 170 lg/m3).
In the present study, C60 was not detected in the brain (< 0.020
micrograms per brain) even though rats were exposed to
similar concentrations (count median diameter, 96 nm; GSD,
2.0; C60 concentration 120 lg/m3) of C60 particles for longer
durations (5 days/week for 4 weeks). Because the particles in
the Oberdo¨ster’s test were generated from electric spark
discharge generator, the particle in that study included much
smaller particles than that in the present study. The discrepancy
between the translocation results of the two studies may be
because of the smaller particle size.
The half-life of 55-nm-wide C60 particles calculated using
the 1-compartment model reported by Baker et al. (2008) was
similar to that calculated using the 2-compartment model and
the data obtained in the present study. This suggests that the 
1-and 2-compartment models yield similar short-term clearance
estimates until 50% decrease, including exposure duration. In
the present study, we first used a 1-compartment model to fit
the experimental data because there were few data points and
parameters. However, this model was found to be unsuitable
for the estimation of lung burden between 90 and 180 days
(Fig. 6a). Hence, a 2-compartment model and three clearance
rate constants were used to fit the experimental data. On the
basis of the 2-compartment model simulation, more than 90%
of the instilled
C60 particles were estimated to have been
eliminated via the rapid clearance pathway. Thus, for the
C60
nanoparticles, we concluded that phagocytosis by 
macrophages, migration of the macrophages to the trachea and
bronchi, and subsequent tracheobronchial clearance was the
major clearance pathway. The slow clearance rate constant k2
was estimated to be quite low (0-0.0042). At 6 months after
instillation, more than 99% of the lung burden was estimated to
be in compartment 2. These results suggest that some of the
instilled C60 nanoparticles (< 10%) are retained in the alveolar
epithelial cells for prolonged periods because C60 nanoparticles
were not observed in the pulmonary interstitium but in the
cytoplasm of alveolar epithelial cells with the TEM 
observation. Alveolar macrophages are not efficient in phagocytizing
nanoparticles and may not be as involved in the pulmonary
retention and clearance of nanoparticles as they are in those of
larger particles (Kreyling et al., 2005; Oberdo¨rster, 1993).
Naota et al. (2009) reported that intratracheally instilled C60
CLEARANCE KINETICS OF FULLERENE C60 NANOPARTICLES
nanoparticles were not observed in the alveolar macrophages
but in the lymph nodes. In the present study, however, C60
nanoparticles were observed in both alveolar macrophages and
alveolar epithelial cells.
Pulmonary particle overload has been observed in rats, with
a particle burden of nearly 1000 lg/g tissue and delayed
clearance from the lungs (Borm et al., 2000; Muhle et al.,
571
572
1990). Because the lung weights of rats were approximately
1.3 g in the present study, the highest dose (1000 lg)
administered in this study can be considered equivalent to the
overload dose in previous studies. Such an overload may
explain why the clearance rate of these particles was lower in
the case of the 1000-lg dose than in the case of the 100 and
200-lg doses in this study. However, even if overload was
induced in the rat lungs in the present study, the half-life of C60
in the rat lungs in the present study was shorter than half-life of
carbon black particles in rat lungs reported in Elder et al. (2005)
(GM, 14-70 nm; 64 days). Thus, it can be concluded that early
stage of C60 nanoparticle clearance, at least, is quite rapid.
Bullard-Dillard et al. (1996) iv injected Sprague-Dawley rats
with 14C-labeled C60 and found that C60 was rapidly cleared
from the blood circulation (within 1 min), and more than 90%
of the injected C60 was accumulated in the liver. Therefore, in
the present study, we concluded that the translocation of C60
from the lung to other organs via blood circulation was
negligible because C60 was not detected in the liver (< 0.20
micrograms per liver). Naota et al. (2009) observed C60
particles in the lumina of the pulmonary alveoli of mice 5 min
after intratracheal C60 instillation. Polystyrene latex particles
(diameter, 240 nm) and TiO2 particles (diameter, 22 nm) have
also been observed in the alveolar lumina of rats subjected to
intratracheal instillation and inhalation of these particles
(Geiser et al., 2005; Kato et al., 2003). In the above studies,
only a small population of nanoparticles can be considered to
have been microscopically observed because only very small
particles penetrate the alveolar-capillary barrier (Xu et al.,
2007).
Three compounds (C60O, unidentified peak A, and 
unidentified peak B) were detected in the extract from the lung
tissue of intratracheally instilled rat. The ratio of C60O
concentration to C60 concentration in the lung tissues increased
until 1 month after instillation and then slightly decreased until
6 months after instillation. Similar change in the ratio was also
observed for the unidentified compound represented by peak A.
The change in ratio may have been caused by two reasons:
differences in the clearance rates of C60O and C60 or the
possibility that C60O is a metabolic product of C60. The ratio of
the concentrations of the unidentified compound represented by
peak B to the C60 in the lung tissues decreased over 6 months.
This suggests that this unidentified compound (peak B) was
more rapidly cleared than C60. The clearance rates of C60O and
the other unidentified compound (peak A) may be slower than
those of C60, or C60 may be metabolized to C60O and/or to the
unidentified compound represented by peak A. Hamano et al.
(1995) reported that C60 was oxidized by the synthetic
cytochrome P-450 chemical model system; however, 
Bullard-Dillard et al. (1996) did not detect C60O in rat tissues. If C60 is
metabolized to C60O and/or to the unidentified compound
represented by peak A, the amount metabolized is quite small.
In this study, a sensitive analytical method for C60 was
developed. In addition, a stable suspension of C60 nanoparticles
SHINOHARA ET AL.
with a narrow particle size distribution (GSD, 1.5) was
prepared by using a surfactant without organic solvents and
then characterized in detail. The following conclusions related
to C60 nanoparticles can be reliably reached on the basis of the
results: (1) The experimentally obtained deposition fraction of
C60 nanoparticles corresponds to that calculated by using
previously published models such as the MPPD model (RIVM,
2002). (2) The C60 nanoparticles deposited on the lung surface
could be mainly cleared via phagocytosis by macrophages and
tracheobronchial clearance. (3) A small percentage of the C60
nanoparticles deposited on the lung surface could be retained in
the epithelial cells for prolonged periods. (4) No translocation
of inhaled C60 nanoparticles to extrapulmonary organs, e.g.,
brain and liver, was recognized by the proposed sensitive
analytical method.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, the extraction and concentration
procedure of C60 from tissue improved the QOL to be
considerably lower levels of intravital
C60 (0.029 lg/g tissue)
than those measured in a previous study (1.1 lg/g tissue;
Kubota et al., 2009). The low QOL of our method enabled the
evaluation of long-term
C60 clearance (at 6 months and 1 year)
when the amount of pulmonary
C60 burden was small. The
precision and recovery with this method were also adequate to
determine the C60 mass burden.
In terms of the deposition fraction of
C60 particle, Baker
et al. (2008) reported that the deposition fraction (count median
diameter of
C60 particles, 55 nm; GSD, 1.48) was 0.14. This
value is possible to be an underestimation because their study
did not take into account
C60 clearance during exposure. The
deposition fraction of
C60 nanoparticle obtained in their
inhalation test was reanalyzed using the clearance rate
constants obtained in this study and the inhalation rate reported
in the study of Baker et al. (2008), 140 ml/min, and found this
fraction to be 0.18 (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the underestimation
was considered to be negligible. In addition, the deposition
fractions of particles with median diameters of 55 nm
(GSD, 1.48; density, 1.7 g/cm3) and 96 nm (GSD, 2.0; density,
1.2 g/cm3) were estimated using an MPPD model with the
following parameters: model in MPPD, Asymn Multipath;
breathing frequency of rat, 102 breaths per minute; tidal
volume of rat, 1.37 ml (Fischer 344 rats) or 1.84 ml (Wistar
rats); and breathing type, nasal. In the present study, the
deposition fractions of the C60 nanoparticles (diameters, 55 and
96 nm) were estimated to be 0.18 and 0.14, respectively, which
were higher than those calculated using the MPPD model for
spherical particles (0.12 and 0.078, respectively). In the present
study, the clearance rates were assumed to be same as that
during the instillation test (GM, 31 nm), regardless of the
particle size. The clearance rates of smaller particles (GM,
31 nm) are higher than those of larger particles (GM, 55 and
96 nm); this difference can be explained. By using the
deposition fraction calculated using the MPPD model, k1 for
the 55- and 96-nm particles were approximately 1/10 of the k1
for the 31-nm particle. According to previous studies (Madl
et al., 1998; Oberdo¨rster et al., 1994), the clearance rate of
smaller particles might be lower than that of larger particles,
but it cannot be higher than that of larger particles. Thus, this
difference might be because of a reason other than the
assumption regarding different clearance rates among different
particle size. It may be because a small number of large
particles have a skewed lognormal distribution in the MPPD
model; such particles were not present in the air used for
experimental exposure because the deposition fraction of these
large particles is small. Thus, of models such as MPPD may
lead to the over- or underestimation of deposition fractions if
the particle size distribution is not carefully selected.
Xu et al. (2007) reported that nonaqueous C60(OH)x (x ¼ 22
or 24) nanoparticles were not detected in the brains of rats that
were intratracheally instilled with C60 particles-a finding
similar to that of the present study. In contrast, Oberdo¨rster
et al. (2004) concluded that in rats, inhaled nanoparticles
deposited on the nasal mucosa are translocated to the brain via
the olfactory bulb because they detected 13C in the olfactory
bulb, cerebellum, and cerebrum until 7 days after inhalation
exposure (for 6 h) to 13C-labeled carbon nanoparticles (count
median diameter, 37 nm; GSD, 1.66; concentration, 170 lg/m3).
In the present study, C60 was not detected in the brain (< 0.020
micrograms per brain) even though rats were exposed to
similar concentrations (count median diameter, 96 nm; GSD,
2.0; C60 concentration 120 lg/m3) of C60 particles for longer
durations (5 days/week for 4 weeks). Because the particles in
the Oberdo¨ster’s test were generated from electric spark
discharge generator, the particle in that study included much
smaller particles than that in the present study. The discrepancy
between the translocation results of the two studies may be
because of the smaller particle size.
The half-life of 55-nm-wide C60 particles calculated using
the 1-compartment model reported by Baker et al. (2008) was
similar to that calculated using the 2-compartment model and
the data obtained in the present study. This suggests that the 
1-and 2-compartment models yield similar short-term clearance
estimates until 50% decrease, including exposure duration. In
the present study, we first used a 1-compartment model to fit
the experimental data because there were few data points and
parameters. However, this model was found to be unsuitable
for the estimation of lung burden between 90 and 180 days
(Fig. 6a). Hence, a 2-compartment model and three clearance
rate constants were used to fit the experimental data. On the
basis of the 2-compartment model simulation, more than 90%
of the instilled
C60 particles were estimated to have been
eliminated via the rapid clearance pathway. Thus, for the
C60
nanoparticles, we concluded that phagocytosis by 
macrophages, migration of the macrophages to the trachea and
bronchi, and subsequent tracheobronchial clearance was the
major clearance pathway. The slow clearance rate constant k2
was estimated to be quite low (0-0.0042). At 6 months after
instillation, more than 99% of the lung burden was estimated to
be in compartment 2. These results suggest that some of the
instilled C60 nanoparticles (< 10%) are retained in the alveolar
epithelial cells for prolonged periods because C60 nanoparticles
were not observed in the pulmonary interstitium but in the
cytoplasm of alveolar epithelial cells with the TEM 
observation. Alveolar macrophages are not efficient in phagocytizing
nanoparticles and may not be as involved in the pulmonary
retention and clearance of nanoparticles as they are in those of
larger particles (Kreyling et al., 2005; Oberdo¨rster, 1993).
Naota et al. (2009) reported that intratracheally instilled C60
CLEARANCE KINETICS OF FULLERENE C60 NANOPARTICLES
nanoparticles were not observed in the alveolar macrophages
but in the lymph nodes. In the present study, however, C60
nanoparticles were observed in both alveolar macrophages and
alveolar epithelial cells.
Pulmonary particle overload has been observed in rats, with
a particle burden of nearly 1000 lg/g tissue and delayed
clearance from the lungs (Borm et al., 2000; Muhle et al.,
571
572
1990). Because the lung weights of rats were approximately
1.3 g in the present study, the highest dose (1000 lg)
administered in this study can be considered equivalent to the
overload dose in previous studies. Such an overload may
explain why the clearance rate of these particles was lower in
the case of the 1000-lg dose than in the case of the 100 and
200-lg doses in this study. However, even if overload was
induced in the rat lungs in the present study, the half-life of C60
in the rat lungs in the present study was shorter than half-life of
carbon black particles in rat lungs reported in Elder et al. (2005)
(GM, 14-70 nm; 64 days). Thus, it can be concluded that early
stage of C60 nanoparticle clearance, at least, is quite rapid.
Bullard-Dillard et al. (1996) iv injected Sprague-Dawley rats
with 14C-labeled C60 and found that C60 was rapidly cleared
from the blood circulation (within 1 min), and more than 90%
of the injected C60 was accumulated in the liver. Therefore, in
the present study, we concluded that the translocation of C60
from the lung to other organs via blood circulation was
negligible because C60 was not detected in the liver (< 0.20
micrograms per liver). Naota et al. (2009) observed C60
particles in the lumina of the pulmonary alveoli of mice 5 min
after intratracheal C60 instillation. Polystyrene latex particles
(diameter, 240 nm) and TiO2 particles (diameter, 22 nm) have
also been observed in the alveolar lumina of rats subjected to
intratracheal instillation and inhalation of these particles
(Geiser et al., 2005; Kato et al., 2003). In the above studies,
only a small population of nanoparticles can be considered to
have been microscopically observed because only very small
particles penetrate the alveolar-capillary barrier (Xu et al.,
2007).
Three compounds (C60O, unidentified peak A, and 
unidentified peak B) were detected in the extract from the lung
tissue of intratracheally instilled rat. The ratio of C60O
concentration to C60 concentration in the lung tissues increased
until 1 month after instillation and then slightly decreased until
6 months after instillation. Similar change in the ratio was also
observed for the unidentified compound represented by peak A.
The change in ratio may have been caused by two reasons:
differences in the clearance rates of C60O and C60 or the
possibility that C60O is a metabolic product of C60. The ratio of
the concentrations of the unidentified compound represented by
peak B to the C60 in the lung tissues decreased over 6 months.
This suggests that this unidentified compound (peak B) was
more rapidly cleared than C60. The clearance rates of C60O and
the other unidentified compound (peak A) may be slower than
those of C60, or C60 may be metabolized to C60O and/or to the
unidentified compound represented by peak A. Hamano et al.
(1995) reported that C60 was oxidized by the synthetic
cytochrome P-450 chemical model system; however, 
Bullard-Dillard et al. (1996) did not detect C60O in rat tissues. If C60 is

calculated to be 2.2 and 7.3 ng/ml for the standard solution,
respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the results
of repeated analyses of standard solution (N ¼ 5) was 1.8%.
Chromatograms of the extract from the lung tissue of
intratracheally instilled rat are shown in Figure 3b. The
detection limit and QOL were calculated to be 8.9 and 29 ng/g
568
tissue for the sample tissue, respectively. The RSD of the
results of repeated analysis of the tissue of C60 instilled rat
(N ¼ 3) was 3.0%. The mean ± SD efficiencies of C60 recovery
from the lung, liver, and brain tissues was 95 ± 5, 92 ± 10, and
94 ± 6%, respectively (Table 2).
The mean ± SD pulmonary C60 burdens (micrograms) 1 h
after the instillation were 12.4 ± 0.40, 220 ± 2.3, and 1100 ± 82
for the 10-, 200-, and 1000-lg doses, respectively. These show
that 110-120% of instilled amounts were determined in the
lungs. Thus, it was confirmed that most of the instilled C60
immediately reached the lung.
The ratio of the C60 burden in right or left lung to that in both
lungs 1 h after the instillation (right lung, 0.311-0.396; left
lung, 0.604-0.689) was almost identical to the ratio of the
weight of the right or left lung to that of both lungs (right lung,
0.343-0.357; left lung, 0.643-0.657), respectively (Table 3).
From these results, we concluded that the C60 burden after
intratracheal instillation did not differ between the right and left
lungs.
C60 Burden in the Lung, Liver, and Brain
A chromatogram of a sample solution extracted from the
lung tissue of a rat is shown in Figure 3b. The lung burdens
after instillation are shown in Table 4. After the instillation of
SHINOHARA ET AL.
100 lg C60, the mean ± SD C60 burdens in the entire lung
(micrograms per lung) at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months were
70.8 ± 14, 26.5 ± 15, 5.22 ± 0.45, and 2.86 ± 2.0, respectively.
In the case of the 200-lg dose, the pulmonary C60 burdens at
18 h and 1, 3, and 6 months were 210 ± 9.0, 62.3 ± 30, 17.3 ±
5.0, and 14.9 ± 3.1, respectively. In the case of the 1000-lg
dose, the pulmonary C60 burden at 18 h, 3 days, 1 week, and 1,
3, and 6 months were 1000 ± 170, 1000 ± 160, 1180 ± 180,
481 ± 79, 91.4 ± 25, and 22.0 ± 6.3, respectively. C60 was not
detected in the liver and brain after the instillation (detection
limit, 0.0089 lg/g tissue). Thus, if C60 translocation to
extrapulmonary organs does occur, the amount translocated
to the liver (< 0.20 lg/liver) and brain (< 0.020 lg/brain) were
confirmed to be < 0.2 and 0.02% of the instillation dose,
respectively. TEM images of the alveolar macrophages in the
lungs of rats at 1 week after the instillation of 0.2 milligrams
per body are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a is a 
low-magnification image of alveolar macrophages. Indicated arrow
shown in Figure 4a is phagosome in the alveolar macrophage.
Magnified image of phagosome in alveolar macrophage was
shown in Figure 4b. Many black particles resembling fullerene
particles are seen in the phagosome. These particles were
identified as C60 particles because high-resolution images
(Fig. 4c) show (111) lattice plane of crystalline fullerene. TEM
images of the alveolar macrophages in the lungs of rats at
6 months after the instillation of 0.2 milligrams per body were
shown in Figure 4d. It is difficult to see the fullerene particles
in the alveolar macrophages at 6 months after the instillation.
We think that most of fullerene particles are exhausted. C60
nanoparticles were also observed in the cytoplasm of the
epithelial cells of the lung. We could not, however, confirm
their presence in the pulmonary interstitium.
The lung burdens after inhalation exposure are shown in
Table 5. The mean ± SD pulmonary
C60 burdens (micrograms
per lung) 3 days and 1 month after the inhalation experiment
were 9.92 ± 2.2 and 5.36 ± 1.2, respectively. C60 was not
detected in the liver and brain after inhalation exposure
(detection limit, 0.0089 lg/g tissue). The TEM images of the
alveolar macrophages in the lungs of rats at 3 days after
inhalation exposure are shown in Figure 5. Phagosomes were

instillation. Few fullerene particles can be seen.
The pulmonary C60 burden after the inhalation experiment
was also estimated using the 2-step decay rate equation.
Assuming that the clearance behavior of the inhaled particles
was the same as that of the injected particles and by fitting the
decay curves of the estimated pulmonary C60 burden using the
clearance rate constants for the rats administered 100 lg C60 to
the measured pulmonary C60 burden, the deposition fraction of
C60 particles (GM and GSD of particle diameter based on
number, 96 nm and 2.0, respectively) after inhalation was
estimated to be 0.14. The measured data and fitting curve are
shown in Figure 6b.
Except C60, three compounds (C60O [retention time {RT} ¼
7.6 min], peak A [RT ¼ 40.5 min], peak B [RT ¼ 49.6 min])
were observed in the extract of the lung tissue of intratracheally
instilled rat (Fig. 3b). Peak A and peak B could not be
identified. The ratio of C60O/C60 concentration increased from
2.2% at 3 days after the instillation to 5.0% at 3 months after
the instillation; the ratio of C60O/C60 concentration in the C60
suspension was 2.6% (Fig. 7a). The ratio of an unidentified
compound (peak A in Fig. 3b) to the C60 area also increased
during 3 months (Fig. 7b). However, the ratio of another
unidentified compound (peak B in Fig. 3b) to the C60 area
decreased during 6 months (Fig. 7c).
observed in the alveolar macrophages and (111) lattice plane of
crystalline fullerene.
Clearance Rate Constant and Deposition Fraction of C60
By fitting the decay curves of the pulmonary C60 burden
estimated using a 2-step decay rate equation (Equations 1 and 2)
until 6 months after instillation to the measured pulmonary C60
burden, we obtained the clearance rate constants k1, k12, and k2
to be 0.029-0.047, 0.00044-0.0034, and 0-0.0042 per day,
respectively (Table 6). The measured data and fitting curve are
shown in Figure 6a. On the basis of the decay rate equations, we
calculated the half-life and 90% decay period as 15, 17, and
28 days and 58, 77, and 87 days for 100, 200, and 1000 lg
administration, respectively. The deposition fraction of C60
particles in the intratracheal instillation was assumed to be
100%; this was confirmed on the basis of the mean pulmonary
C60 burden (micrograms) at 1 h after the instillation in the
quality assurance tests.
results: (1) The experimentally obtained deposition fraction of
C60 nanoparticles corresponds to that calculated by using
previously published models such as the MPPD model (RIVM,
2002). (2) The C60 nanoparticles deposited on the lung surface
could be mainly cleared via phagocytosis by macrophages and
tracheobronchial clearance. (3) A small percentage of the C60
nanoparticles deposited on the lung surface could be retained in
the epithelial cells for prolonged periods. (4) No translocation
of inhaled C60 nanoparticles to extrapulmonary organs, e.g.,
brain and liver, was recognized by the proposed sensitive
analytical method.

Fullerene (carbon sixty [C60]) has potential industrial and medical
applications. In the future, people working in or residing near
manufacturing facilities may be exposed to C60. Therefore,
quantitative data on long-term C60 clearance from the lungs are
required. To estimate the clearance rate and deposition fraction of
C60 from inhalation exposure, the C60 burden in the lungs, liver, and
brain of rats was determined after intratracheal instillation and
inhalation. Male Wistar rats were intratracheally instilled with
different concentrations of a C60 suspension prepared with Tween
80 (geometric mean [GM] of particle diameter based on number, 
18-29 nm; geometric standard deviation [GSD] of particle diameter, 1.5;
and doses, 100, 200, and 1000 micrograms per body) or exposed to
a C60 aerosol prepared with nebulizer (GM of particle diameter
based on number, 96 nm; GSD of particle diameter, 2.0; and
exposure level, 120 mg/m3). C60 burden in the lungs, liver, and brain
was determined at various time points (1 h to 6 months) by a newly
developed sensitive high-performance liquid 
chromatography-ultraviolet absorptiometry combined with extraction and 
concentration of C60 from the organs. C60 clearance was evaluated using a
2-compartment model: fast clearance after deposition on lung surface
and slow clearance after retention in the epithelium. The detection
limit of our analysis method was 8.9 ng/g tissue. Pulmonary C60
burden decreased with time and depended on the C60 concentration
administered. The concentration of C60 in the liver and brain was
below the detection limit: 8.9 ng/g tissue. The half-life of 
intratracheally instilled C60 was 15-28 days. The deposition mass fraction
of inhaled C60 was 0.14. Mode evaluation revealed that most instilled
particles could be eliminated by the fast clearance pathway. This
finding is consistent with the transmission electron microscopy
finding that many particles were present in alveolar macrophages.

Fullerene, carbon sixty (C60), possesses unique 
physicochemical properties and is a candidate molecule for many
industrial and medical nanotechnology applications, such as
energy conversion and drug delivery. In the future, people
working in or residing near manufacturing facilities may be
exposed to airborne C60 particles.
Upon inhalation, some of these particles are deposited in the
alveoli, depending on the particle size/shape/density, animal
species, and breathing pattern. Fluid-flow models such as the
multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model have been
developed to estimate the deposition fraction of spherical particles
in rats and humans (RIVM, 2002). The deposition fractions for
rats, calculated using the MPPD model, were 0.2-0.3 for 10- to
100-nm particles and 0.05-0.2 for 100- to 1000-nm particles.
In Fischer 344 rats, the deposition fraction was greater for C60
nanoparticles (0.14 for 55-nm particles) than for C60
microparticles (0.093 for 930-nm particles) (Baker et al., 2008).
The rate clearance of carbon black particles from the lungs
was increased with the primary particle size (14-70 nm) though
the secondary particle size was similar (geometric mean [GM]:
1.4-1.6 lm) (Elder et al., 2005). The main clearance pathway
of particulate matter deposited on the alveolar surface is
phagocytosis by the alveolar macrophages followed by 
transport to the larynx (Lehnert and Morrow, 1985a,b; Naumann
and Schlesinger, 1986). Some particles are transferred to the
pulmonary interstitium and/or epithelial cells. Total pulmonary
retention and translocation to the pulmonary interstitium are
significantly greater for ultrafine titanium dioxide (TiO2)
particles than for fine TiO2 particles in rats (Oberdo¨rster
et al., 1994). The size of C60 nanoparticles in the test
suspension is very important in toxicity evaluations; however,
the size of the test samples used has not been described in
sufficient detail in most studies on the disposition of C60. In the
Japanese New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organization project, stable dispersion and stable aerosol of
C60 nanoparticles (Endoh et al., 2009; Shimada et al., 2009)
were successfully prepared and were applied to the pulmonary
toxicity tests (Morimoto et al., 2010).
IP administered C60 particles are not detected in the brain,
whereas ip or iv administered particles are detected in the liver
and spleen (Bullard-Dillard et al., 1996; Gharbi et al., 2005;
Moussa et al., 1996). In rats, iv administered C60 is rapidly
cleared from the circulation (within 1 min), largely 
accumulated in the liver (90-95%), and retained in the liver for more
than 120 h (Bullard-Dillard et al., 1996). Naota et al. (2009)
microscopically examined aggregated C60 particles in the
lumina of pulmonary capillaries and in pulmonary lymph
nodes 5 min after intratracheal C60 instillation. The 
translocation of inhaled particles from the lung to the 
extrapulmonary organs has been reported to be small (< 1%, Kreyling
et al., 2002; < 0.5%, Mo¨ller et al., 2008). However,
Oberdo¨rster et al. (2004) reported that inhaled ultrafine 13C
particles may be translocated to the brain (cerebrum and
cerebellum) via the olfactory bulb.
Quantitative data on long-term C60 clearance have not yet
been reported. Furthermore, although C60 has not been detected
in brain tissue after exposure to these particles, the detection
limit of the analytical methods used in previous studies was not
sufficiently low. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether
C60 nanoparticles are retained in the lung or translocated to the
other organs and to determine the severity of the adverse
effects of the retained particles on the basis of previous results.
Highly sensitive analytical methods are required to detect the
translocation of C60 to extrapulmonary organs, especially the
brain, because unlike gaseous chemicals nanoparticles cannot
be maintained at steadily high concentrations during inhalation
experiments. Kubota et al. (2009) and Moussa et al. (1997)
used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which are better
than radioisotope analysis for the quantification of C60, to
determine the concentration of intravital C60. The 
determination limit of these methods is 1.1 lg/g tissue (Kubota et al.,
2009). Considering the general weight of brain (approximately
2 g), the transfer to brain cannot be detected unless more than
a few percentage of the lung burden of C60 translocate to the
brain even at high concentration such as 2 mg/m3. Therefore, to
evaluate the possibility of translocation of nanoparticle to the
brain reported by Oberdo¨rster et al. (2004), this limit is
inadequate and more sensitive analytical methods are required.
In addition, long-term clearance of C60 from the lung is
difficult to measure because of the low C60 burden in the lungs
in the inhalation exposure test. Therefore, in this study, we
evaluated long-term C60 clearance by using intratracheal C60
instillation because this method results in a considerably
greater pulmonary C60 burden than C60 inhalation.
In this study, we aimed to determine the deposition,
clearance, and translocation of C60 nanoparticles by conducting

the following experiments: (1) development of a highly
sensitive method involving sample concentration and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet (UV)
detection for the analysis of C60 in biological samples; (2)
determination of C60 burden in the lung, liver, and brain until
6 months after intratracheal C60 instillation and until 1 month
after C60 inhalation; and (3) estimation of the clearance rate and
deposition fraction of C60 nanoparticles based on the results of
these determinations.
