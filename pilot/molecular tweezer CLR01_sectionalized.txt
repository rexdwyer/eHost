>>>section: conclusion
Conclusion
A single dose of CLR01, at 2,500-fold the efficacious
dose, induced behavioral distress and liver injury, but
did not result in mortality. Daily dosing at 250-fold the
efficacious dose did not result in any signs of behavioral,
serological, or pathological toxicity. In vitro evaluation of
CLR01’s influence on physiologically normal protein 
assembly did not show disruption until 55-fold excess of
CLR01 was used. These results indicate a high safety
margin for CLR01. Brain penetration of CLR01 was 
observed to be ~2% of blood levels depending on age, yet
it was persistent for 3 days. These data were used to 
verify that sufficient levels of CLR01 are present
in the
brain for the putative mechanism of action.

Methods
Mice
All procedures were compliant with the National 
Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals, and approved by the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Animal
Care Use Committee. Two-month old WT C57BL/6J
mice for toxicity studies were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, Stock 000664). 3×Tg
and WT mice with the same genetic background [14]
for BBB studies were bred at UCLA. Mice were housed
2-4 per cage under standard conditions and maintained
on a 12-h dark and 12-h light cycle with ad libitum 
access to rodent chow and water.
CLR01
CLR01 was produced and purified as described 
previously [7]. 3H-CLR01 was prepared by Moravek 
Biochem-icals (Brea, CA) using a method that provides 3H
incorporation into the hydrocarbon skeleton (i.e., 
non-labile protons) [20] yielding pure 3H-CLR01 with specific
activity 1.3 Ci/mmol.
Inhibition of tubulin polymerization
The effect of CLR01 on tubulin polymerization [21,22]
was analyzed using a commercial kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.,
Page 3 of 14
Denver, Colorado). Three mg/ml porcine brain tubulin
(~18 μM) were allowed to polymerize at 37 ºC in the 
absence or presence of CLR01 concentrations ranging
from 10-1,000 μM. The turbidity of the solution was
measured as absorbance at λ = 340 nm using a Synergy
HT microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The data
are an average of three independent experiments with
two wells per condition.
Toxicity evaluation
For acute-toxicity studies, 2-m old C57BL/6J mice were
administered saline-vehicle, 10 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg
CLR01 by a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection. The
mice were sacrificed 24-h after the injection. For chronic
toxicity studies, 2-m old C57BL/6J mice were 
administered saline-vehicle, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg CLR01 by
daily IP injection for 30 days. Acute-study mice were
visually monitored for 1 h after injection and then every
50 min for 10 min over the first 6 h of the experiment
for changes in activity and behavior. The mice also were
monitored every 110 min for 10 min during the last 6 h
of the experiment until they were sacrificed. 
Chronic-study mice were monitored for 1 h after injection and
then 3 times a day for 10 min each, every day of the first
week. During that week there were no appreciable
changes in the behavior, appearance, or weight of the
mice. Therefore, monitoring was reduced to twice a day
during the remainder of the experiment. On all 
occasions, the mice were monitored for any signs of severe
toxicity, including bruising or bleeding, pale mucous
membranes or extremities, diarrhea, dehydration, 
neurological signs, such as difficulty ambulating or paralysis,
tachypnea or dyspnea, or abdominal distension.
Following the treatment, mice were anesthetized with
pentobarbital and blood was collected by cardiac puncture
and placed in tubes containing a clot activator for serum
separation (Capiject T-MG tubes, Terumo Medical 
Products, Somerset, NJ). Then, the lungs were filled through
the trachea with 4% paraformaldehyde to prevent collapse,
and tissues (brain, heart-lung, liver, kidney, and spleen)
were collected and fixed for 72 h in 4% paraformaldehyde
at a ratio of ~1:10 tissue:fixative (v/v). Tissues then were
transferred into a 70%-ethanol solution and transferred to
the UCLA Mouse Pathology Core for paraffin embedding,
sectioning, and tissue histopathology analysis. Serum was
analyzed by the UCLA Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine (DLAM) Animal Serology & Molecular 
Diagnostic Laboratory for an 11-panel serum chemical analysis
using the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry system (Alfa
Wassermann Diagnostic Technologies, West Caldwell,
NJ). The panel included: alanine aminotransferase, 
aspar-tate aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
cre-atinine, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea
nitrogen, cholesterol, total protein, and glucose.

Plasma concentration and blood-brain barrier permeability
For studies of plasma concentration, CLR01 was 
administered by either SC or intravenous (IV) injection at
1 mg/kg, or by oral gavage at 10 mg/kg, and plasma was
collected at time points between 0.33 − 24 h. Three mice
were used per time point. The concentration of CLR01
in plasma was determined by Wolfe Laboratories Inc.
(Watertown, MA) using liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) by interpolation of sample peak
area data into the calibration curve.
The following groups of mice were used for CLR01
BBB penetration studies: 3×Tg and the corresponding
WT mice at 2-m, 12-m, and 22 − 24-m (hereafter
referred to as 22-m) of age. The groups were: 2-m WT,
2-m Tg, 12-m WT, 12-m Tg, 22-m WT, 22-m Tg. Mice
were administered 3H-CLR01 intravenously. Two μCi
per gram of mouse body weight, which are equal to
11.86 μg/g of CLR01 in which 3H-CLR01 made up 10%
of the total CLR01, were injected into the jugular vein.
Blood and brain were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 8, 24, or 72 h
(not all time points were collected for all groups, see the
Results section). For times ≤ 3 h, mice were anesthetized
by IP injection of ketamine and xylazine. The mice
remained anesthetized following the injection until the
specified time point, at which point they were given a 
lethal dose of pentobarbital. Then, blood was collected via
a cardiac puncture, and the brain harvested with or
without a perfusion step Pharmacokinetics of CLR01 in
vivo. For time points 8-72 h, mice were not anesthetized
and 3H-CLR01 was injected into the tail vein. This
change was due to the difficulty of keeping mice 
anesthetized for longer than 3 h. No differences were 
observed between mice given anesthesia and jugular vein
injections and mice receiving tail vein injections.
Euthanasia procedures were the same as described
above. For all mice, one hemisphere of the brain and
100-350 μl of blood were separately digested following
instructions from Perkin-Elmer (document: Scintillation
Cocktails and Consumables) with 1 ml Solvable (Perkin-
Elmer, Waltham, MA), added to Ultima Gold Liquid
Scintillation Cocktail (Perkin-Elmer) and read in a
Triathler Liquid Scintillation Counter model 425-034,
(Hidex, Turku, Finland). Brain permeability percentage
was calculated as counts per minute (CPM) per g of
brain relative to CPM per ml of blood. The data are an
average of values from three mice per genotype/age/time
combination.
For CLR01 transport-saturation studies using 5× the
CLR01 dose, 3H-CLR01 was kept at 10% of the total
CLR01 mixture and a total of 59.3 μg of CLR01 (10 μCi)
per g of mouse body weight was injected IV (22-m WT
5× dose). For CLR01 brain-accumulation studies, two
11.86-μg/g injections were administered at equal time
intervals (22-m WT 2× inj). In these experiments, mice
Page 4 of 14
were injected at time = 0 and at t = ½ of euthanasia time.
For example, in the original, single-injection 
experiments, a mouse would receive an injection at t = 0 and
then be euthanized at t = 1 h. In this experiment, a
mouse received one injection at t = 0, a second injection
at t = 0.5 h, and then was euthanized at t = 1 h.
In experiments using 3H-CLR01, urine was collected
when possible over the period between injection and 
euthanasia. In all cases, we found that the urine was 
radioactive. However, comparison among mice proved to be
difficult. We could not normalize the radioactivity 
because the amount of urine in the bladder prior to 
injection and the volume produced during the experiment
could not be calculated. Thus, we can simply conclude
qualitatively that CLR01 is excreted through the urine,
but cannot provide quantitative measures of what 
percentage of the compound is excreted this way.
In vitro metabolism
Potential dephosphorylation of CLR01 was analyzed by
incubating 100 nmol CLR01 with 0.08 units of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP; calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase,
Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) for 60 min at 60°C. One
enzymatic unit is defined as the amount of enzyme
required for catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of
p-nitrophenylphosphate per minute. p-Nitrophenylpho-
sphate disodium salt at 5-50 nmol (Fisher, Waltham,
Massachusetts) was used for generation of a standard
curve. The amount of inorganic phosphate generated was
measured spectrophotometrically using an EnzChek 
Phosphate Assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a DU-640
spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California)
at λ = 360 nm. Baseline values were subtracted from
readings and compared to the standard curve resulting
from serial ALP reactions to calculate the amount of
inorganic phosphate. Similarly, potential 
dephosphoryla-tion of CLR01 by brain homogenates was measured. For
these experiments, one brain hemisphere was 
homogenized by sonication in the presence of cOmplete 
protease-inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Protein
concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). A “phosphate-mop” system
was used according to the EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit
instructions to sequester inorganic phosphates naturally
present in 1.5 mg of brain, and then 50-nmol CLR01 or
different concentrations of p-nitrophenylphosphate 
di-sodium salt were added and incubated for 60 min at 60°C.
Statistics
Data are shown as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as 
appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism
6.0c (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). For all experiments,

Safety and pharmacological characterization of
the molecular tweezer CLR01 - a broad-spectrum
inhibitor of amyloid proteins’ toxicity
Aida Attar1,2, Wai-Ting Coco Chan1, Frank-Gerrit Klärner4, Thomas Schrader4 and Gal Bitan1,2,3*
Abstract
Background: The “molecular tweezer” CLR01 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of abnormal protein self-assembly,
which acts by binding selectively to Lys residues. CLR01 has been tested in several in vitro and in vivo models of
amyloidoses all without signs of toxicity. With the goal of developing CLR01 as a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer’s
disease and other amyloidoses, here we studied its safety and pharmacokinetics.
Methods: Toxicity studies were performed in 2-m old wild-type mice. Toxicity was evaluated by serum chemical
analysis, histopathology analysis, and qualitative behavioral analysis. Brain penetration studies were performed using
radiolabeled CLR01 in both wild-type mice and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease at 2-m, 12-m, and
22-m of age. Brain levels were measured from 0.5 − 72 h post administration.
Results: Examination of CLR01’s effect on tubulin polymerization, representing normal protein assembly, showed
disruption of the process only when 55-fold excess CLR01 was used, supporting the compound’s putative “process-
specific” mechanism of action.
A single-injection of 100 mg/kg CLR01 in mice - 2,500-fold higher than the efficacious dose reported previously,
induced temporary distress and liver injury, but no mortality. Daily injection of doses up to 10 mg/kg did not
produce any signs of toxicity, suggesting a high safety margin.
The brain penetration of CLR01 was found to be 1 − 3% of blood levels depending on age. Though CLR01 was
almost completely removed from the blood by 8 h, unexpectedly, brain levels of CLR01 remained steady over 72 h.
Conclusion: Estimation of brain levels compared to amyloid β-protein concentrations reported previously suggest
that the stoichiometry obtained in vitro and in vivo is similar, supporting the mechanism of action of CLR01.
The favorable safety margin of CLR01, together with efficacy shown in multiple animal models, support further
development of CLR01 as a disease-modifying agent for amyloidoses.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) along with over 30 other 
diseases, are amyloidoses, in which aberrant protein folding
and aggregation is a central pathologic process. 
Amyloidoses are characterized by self-assembly of one or
more proteins into toxic oligomers and insoluble 
amyloid. Currently, amyloidoses have no cure. Inhibition of

the aberrant aggregation process is highly challenging
because unlike traditional drug targets that have defined
structures and in many cases, specific binding sites or
active sites, toxic oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins
are metastable structures that sample numerous 
conformations and amyloid fibrils are characterized by flat 
surfaces. These structures largely are devoid of specific
binding pockets [1,2]. A possible solution to these 
challenges is to aim for one step prior to the unknown and
unfavorable structures, specifically targeting the 
aberrantly self-associating proteins at the level of amino acid
interactions.CA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
Recently, we reported that the molecular tweezer,
CLR01, is a novel, broad-spectrum inhibitor of abnormal
protein self-assembly, which acts by a “process-specific”
mechanism and inhibits the aggregation and toxicity of
multiple amyloidogenic proteins [3-5]. CLR01 is a small
molecule, originally developed as an artificial Lys 
receptor [6,7] that binds Lys residues with low micromolar 
affinity [3,6] or in certain cases, sub-micromolar affinity
[8]. The binding is highly labile [9], yet it is selective to
Lys and involves inclusion of the Lys side-chain within
the tweezer cavity (Figure 1). CLR01 also binds to Arg
with ~10-fold lower affinity [7,10]. Selective binding to
Lys is achieved by a combination of hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions. Lys is the only proteinaceous
amino acid side-chain that effectively forms both types
of interactions - hydrophobic interactions involving the
butylene chain, and Coulombic attraction/repulsion of its
ε-NH3+ group. Both types of interactions are important in
aberrant protein self-assembly. Thus, CLR01 competes for
the same interactions that are key to nucleation and
aggregation by most amyloidogenic proteins [11,12].
The moderate-affinity binding of CLR01 to Lys is key
to its process-specific mechanism. Unlike the forces that
mediate normal protein biology, those that control the
abnormal assembly of amyloidogenic proteins were not
Page 2 of 14
optimized by evolution. Consequently, the binding 
energies involved are substantially weaker than those 
controlling normal protein structure and function. Therefore,
although CLR01 may bind to exposed Lys residues in 
virtually any protein, we reasoned that at sufficiently low
concentrations, labile binding with micromolar affinity
would only affect relatively weak interactions, such as
those that mediate aberrant protein oligomerization and
nucleation.
The data generated to date have supported our 
conjecture. In vitro studies of metabolic toxicity and drug-drug
interaction involving the cytochrome P450 system
showed minimal inhibition of five major isoforms with
half-maximal inhibition concentration values above levels
expected to cause drug-drug interactions [5]. Minimal 
activation of the cytochrome P450 system by CLR01 was 
detected up to 10-μM concentrations in a cell-culture
system compared to the antibiotic rifampicin, which was
used as a positive control [5]. In nerve growth 
factor-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cells treated with
CLR01, no toxicity was detected up to 200 μM, whereas a
mild decrease in cell viability was observed at 400 μM-1 −
3 orders of magnitude higher than concentrations needed
for inhibition of the toxicity of different amyloidogenic
proteins in cell culture [3,13].
In vivo, CLR01 prevented deformation and mortality
in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein (α-syn) toxicity by
keeping α-syn soluble, preventing its neurotoxic effects,
and promoting disinhibition of the 26S 
ubiquitin-proteasome system, thus allowing it to degrade the excess
α-syn [4]. Peripheral, subcutaneous (SC) administration of
CLR01 in a triple-transgenic (3×Tg) mouse model of AD
[14] resulted in a significant decrease in amyloid plaque
burden and hyperphosphorylated tau, with an 
accompanying decrease in microgliosis [5]. Similarly, peripheral 
administration of CLR01 in a mouse model of familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy expressing mutant 
transthyretin led to a significant decrease in transthyretin 
deposition and associated endoplasmic-reticulum stress,
apoptosis, and protein oxidation markers [15]. In support
of the putative process-specific mechanism of CLR01, no
signs of toxicity were observed in any of these studies.
CLR01 was used at up to 10 μM in the zebrafish model
(in the water environment [4]), at 40 μg/kg/day in the AD
mouse model [5], and at 1.2 mg/kg/day in the 
transthyretin model [15].
Further support for the proposed process-specific
mechanism came from the observation that CLR01 did
not affect processing of amyloid β-protein precursor
(APP) in the treated AD mice. In APP, Lys residues are
located N-terminally to the α- and β-secretase cleavage
sites. Ostensibly, CLR01 binding to these residues could
have affected APP processing. However, no differences
were found in levels of APP cleavage products between

brain extracts of vehicle- or CLR01-treated mice [5]. To
further examine the putative process-specific mechanism
and toxicity profile of CLR01, here we evaluated the
effect of the compound in vitro on a physiologic (as 
opposed to aberrant) protein self-assembly process-tubu-
lin polymerization-and in vivo using wild-type (WT)
mice to which CLR01 was administered at high doses 
either as a one-time bolus or daily for 1 month.
A large number of amyloidoses affect the central 
nervous system (CNS). If molecular tweezers are to be 
developed as drugs for these diseases, they likely will need
to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the 
AD-mouse-treatment study, SC administration of CLR01
resulted in clear CNS effects [5], suggesting that the
compound penetrated through the BBB into the brain of
the mice. However, in that study we only began to 
measure the brain penetration levels and did not address the
effect of age or disease. The BBB becomes compromised
with aging [16] and this compromise is thought to be 
exacerbated in patients with certain neurodegenerative 
diseases, including AD [17-19]. Previously, using 3H-CLR01
injected intravenously, we found radioactivity levels in the
brain to be ~2% of blood levels in 12-m old WTand 3×Tg
AD mice [5]. We present here a characterization of the
BBB’s permeability to CLR01 and the effects of age and
presence of AD-linked transgenes. We also assess a likely
route of metabolism of CLR01 in mouse brain.
Methods
Mice
All procedures were compliant with the National 
Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals, and approved by the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Animal
Care Use Committee. Two-month old WT C57BL/6J
mice for toxicity studies were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, Stock 000664). 3×Tg
and WT mice with the same genetic background [14]
for BBB studies were bred at UCLA. Mice were housed
2-4 per cage under standard conditions and maintained
on a 12-h dark and 12-h light cycle with ad libitum 
access to rodent chow and water.
CLR01
CLR01 was produced and purified as described 
previously [7]. 3H-CLR01 was prepared by Moravek 
Biochem-icals (Brea, CA) using a method that provides 3H
incorporation into the hydrocarbon skeleton (i.e., 
non-labile protons) [20] yielding pure 3H-CLR01 with specific
activity 1.3 Ci/mmol.
Inhibition of tubulin polymerization
The effect of CLR01 on tubulin polymerization [21,22]
was analyzed using a commercial kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.,
Page 3 of 14
Denver, Colorado). Three mg/ml porcine brain tubulin
(~18 μM) were allowed to polymerize at 37 ºC in the 
absence or presence of CLR01 concentrations ranging
from 10-1,000 μM. The turbidity of the solution was
measured as absorbance at λ = 340 nm using a Synergy
HT microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The data
are an average of three independent experiments with
two wells per condition.
Toxicity evaluation
For acute-toxicity studies, 2-m old C57BL/6J mice were
administered saline-vehicle, 10 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg
CLR01 by a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection. The
mice were sacrificed 24-h after the injection. For chronic
toxicity studies, 2-m old C57BL/6J mice were 
administered saline-vehicle, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg CLR01 by
daily IP injection for 30 days. Acute-study mice were
visually monitored for 1 h after injection and then every
50 min for 10 min over the first 6 h of the experiment
for changes in activity and behavior. The mice also were
monitored every 110 min for 10 min during the last 6 h
of the experiment until they were sacrificed. 
Chronic-study mice were monitored for 1 h after injection and
then 3 times a day for 10 min each, every day of the first
week. During that week there were no appreciable
changes in the behavior, appearance, or weight of the
mice. Therefore, monitoring was reduced to twice a day
during the remainder of the experiment. On all 
occasions, the mice were monitored for any signs of severe
toxicity, including bruising or bleeding, pale mucous
membranes or extremities, diarrhea, dehydration, 
neurological signs, such as difficulty ambulating or paralysis,
tachypnea or dyspnea, or abdominal distension.
Following the treatment, mice were anesthetized with
pentobarbital and blood was collected by cardiac puncture
and placed in tubes containing a clot activator for serum
separation (Capiject T-MG tubes, Terumo Medical 
Products, Somerset, NJ). Then, the lungs were filled through
the trachea with 4% paraformaldehyde to prevent collapse,
and tissues (brain, heart-lung, liver, kidney, and spleen)
were collected and fixed for 72 h in 4% paraformaldehyde
at a ratio of ~1:10 tissue:fixative (v/v). Tissues then were
transferred into a 70%-ethanol solution and transferred to
the UCLA Mouse Pathology Core for paraffin embedding,
sectioning, and tissue histopathology analysis. Serum was
analyzed by the UCLA Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine (DLAM) Animal Serology & Molecular 
Diagnostic Laboratory for an 11-panel serum chemical analysis
using the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry system (Alfa
Wassermann Diagnostic Technologies, West Caldwell,
NJ). The panel included: alanine aminotransferase, 
aspar-tate aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
cre-atinine, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea
nitrogen, cholesterol, total protein, and glucose.

Plasma concentration and blood-brain barrier permeability
For studies of plasma concentration, CLR01 was 
administered by either SC or intravenous (IV) injection at
1 mg/kg, or by oral gavage at 10 mg/kg, and plasma was
collected at time points between 0.33 − 24 h. Three mice
were used per time point. The concentration of CLR01
in plasma was determined by Wolfe Laboratories Inc.
(Watertown, MA) using liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) by interpolation of sample peak
area data into the calibration curve.
The following groups of mice were used for CLR01
BBB penetration studies: 3×Tg and the corresponding
WT mice at 2-m, 12-m, and 22 − 24-m (hereafter
referred to as 22-m) of age. The groups were: 2-m WT,
2-m Tg, 12-m WT, 12-m Tg, 22-m WT, 22-m Tg. Mice
were administered 3H-CLR01 intravenously. Two μCi
per gram of mouse body weight, which are equal to
11.86 μg/g of CLR01 in which 3H-CLR01 made up 10%
of the total CLR01, were injected into the jugular vein.
Blood and brain were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 8, 24, or 72 h
(not all time points were collected for all groups, see the
Results section). For times ≤ 3 h, mice were anesthetized
by IP injection of ketamine and xylazine. The mice
remained anesthetized following the injection until the
specified time point, at which point they were given a 
lethal dose of pentobarbital. Then, blood was collected via
a cardiac puncture, and the brain harvested with or
without a perfusion step Pharmacokinetics of CLR01 in
vivo. For time points 8-72 h, mice were not anesthetized
and 3H-CLR01 was injected into the tail vein. This
change was due to the difficulty of keeping mice 
anesthetized for longer than 3 h. No differences were 
observed between mice given anesthesia and jugular vein
injections and mice receiving tail vein injections.
Euthanasia procedures were the same as described
above. For all mice, one hemisphere of the brain and
100-350 μl of blood were separately digested following
instructions from Perkin-Elmer (document: Scintillation
Cocktails and Consumables) with 1 ml Solvable (Perkin-
Elmer, Waltham, MA), added to Ultima Gold Liquid
Scintillation Cocktail (Perkin-Elmer) and read in a
Triathler Liquid Scintillation Counter model 425-034,
(Hidex, Turku, Finland). Brain permeability percentage
was calculated as counts per minute (CPM) per g of
brain relative to CPM per ml of blood. The data are an
average of values from three mice per genotype/age/time
combination.
For CLR01 transport-saturation studies using 5× the
CLR01 dose, 3H-CLR01 was kept at 10% of the total
CLR01 mixture and a total of 59.3 μg of CLR01 (10 μCi)
per g of mouse body weight was injected IV (22-m WT
5× dose). For CLR01 brain-accumulation studies, two
11.86-μg/g injections were administered at equal time
intervals (22-m WT 2× inj). In these experiments, mice
Page 4 of 14
were injected at time = 0 and at t = ½ of euthanasia time.
For example, in the original, single-injection 
experiments, a mouse would receive an injection at t = 0 and
then be euthanized at t = 1 h. In this experiment, a
mouse received one injection at t = 0, a second injection
at t = 0.5 h, and then was euthanized at t = 1 h.
In experiments using 3H-CLR01, urine was collected
when possible over the period between injection and 
euthanasia. In all cases, we found that the urine was 
radioactive. However, comparison among mice proved to be
difficult. We could not normalize the radioactivity 
because the amount of urine in the bladder prior to 
injection and the volume produced during the experiment
could not be calculated. Thus, we can simply conclude
qualitatively that CLR01 is excreted through the urine,
but cannot provide quantitative measures of what 
percentage of the compound is excreted this way.
In vitro metabolism
Potential dephosphorylation of CLR01 was analyzed by
incubating 100 nmol CLR01 with 0.08 units of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP; calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase,
Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) for 60 min at 60°C. One
enzymatic unit is defined as the amount of enzyme
required for catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of
p-nitrophenylphosphate per minute. p-Nitrophenylpho-
sphate disodium salt at 5-50 nmol (Fisher, Waltham,
Massachusetts) was used for generation of a standard
curve. The amount of inorganic phosphate generated was
measured spectrophotometrically using an EnzChek 
Phosphate Assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a DU-640
spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California)
at λ = 360 nm. Baseline values were subtracted from
readings and compared to the standard curve resulting
from serial ALP reactions to calculate the amount of
inorganic phosphate. Similarly, potential 
dephosphorylation of CLR01 by brain homogenates was measured. For
these experiments, one brain hemisphere was 
homogenized by sonication in the presence of cOmplete 
protease-inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Protein
concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). A “phosphate-mop” system
was used according to the EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit
instructions to sequester inorganic phosphates naturally
present in 1.5 mg of brain, and then 50-nmol CLR01 or
different concentrations of p-nitrophenylphosphate 
disodium salt were added and incubated for 60 min at 60°C.
Statistics
Data are shown as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as 
appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism
6.0c (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). For all experiments, 
2-way analysis of variance followed by Sidak’s multiple

comparisons test post-hoc analysis were used. The level
of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
In vitro examination of the process-specific mechanism
of CLR01
As stated above, the mechanism by which CLR01 
remodels the assembly of amyloidogenic proteins into
non-toxic assemblies that can be degraded by normal
clearance mechanisms is by its specific binding to Lys
residues. The mechanism is “process-specific” because it
is postulated to affect only the aberrant assembly of 
proteins that leads to toxic oligomers and aggregates, but
not normal protein structure, function, or assembly as
happens, e.g., in tubulin polymerization. To test whether
this indeed is the case, we examined the effect of CLR01
on tubulin polymerization [21,22]. Three mg/ml (~18 μM)
porcine brain tubulin, which contains 3.8% Lys and 4.8%
Arg, was allowed to polymerize in the absence or presence
of CLR01 concentrations ranging from 10-1,000 μM.
In the absence of CLR01 or in the presence of up to
300 μM of the compound, the change in turbidity
followed a typical sigmoidal curve, starting at 0.05-0.09
absorbance units (Figure 2). The absorbance remained
unchanged for the first 10-15 minutes, which is a typical
lag phase in this reaction, and then increased gradually
up to ~60 min, at which point the rate of increase began
to decline, and the reaction was followed for another
10 min. The only concentration at which significant
modulation of the polymerization was observed was
Page 5 of 14
1,000 μM (Figure 2, blue curve), i.e., at a tubulin:CLR01
concentration ratio ~1:55. At this high ratio, a high 
absorbance, 0.15, was observed immediately, followed by a
slight gradual decline during the lag phase. Then, the 
absorbance began to increase for 30 min, followed by a
slow decline for the rest of the experiment. One 
interpretation of these data is that at the high concentration
used, 1,000 μM, binding of CLR01 to tubulin induced
immediate self-assembly into irregular aggregates. 
Similar immediate induction of self-assembly was observed
with 4 of the 9 amyloidogenic proteins tested by Sinha
et al. [3], suggesting that this reaction occurs with some,
but not all proteins. In all the cases studied by Sinha
et al., these aggregates were non-amyloidogenic and
non-toxic.
Presumably, following the immediate aggregation in
the presence of 1,000 μM CLR01, the irregular tubulin
aggregates observed at t = 0 partially disassembled as the
polymerization reaction progressed, between 10-30 min.
At that point, the high CLR01 concentration appeared
to interfere with the polymerization reaction and the
tubulin polymers gradually disassembled. Validation of
this interpretation will require further investigation, yet
it was not the focus of the current study.
The motivation for this experiment was to test
whether the concentration of CLR01 needed to interfere
with a controlled self-assembly process was substantially
different from that required for modulation of aberrant
self-assembly, which was found indeed to be the case.
Most of the protein:CLR01 concentration ratios needed
for inhibition of amyloidogenic protein aggregation were
in the range 1:1-1:3 [3], compared to the 1:55 tubulin:
CLR01 concentration ratio at which disruption of 
tubulin polymerization was observed. These results support
the specificity of CLR01 for inhibition of aberrant 
aggregation as opposed to controlled polymerization.
CLR01 safety
If CLR01 indeed operates by a process-specific 
mechanism and remodels the abnormal aggregation of 
amyloidogenic proteins at substantially lower concentrations
than concentrations that would perturb normal 
physiological processes, one would expect the compound to
have a high therapeutic index. To calculate the 
therapeutic index, a lethal dose must be reached. The in vitro
data described above suggested that disruption of 
tubulin polymerization occurs at concentration ratios 20-50
times higher than those needed for inhibition of 
aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. In addition, cell 
culture experiments indicated that CLR01 began to show
toxicity at concentrations 1-3 orders of magnitude
higher than those required for inhibition of toxicity by
different amyloidogenic proteins [3,4]. The next rational
step was to test the safety margin of CLR01 in vivo.
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
Based on the in vitro and cell culture data, we expected
that 100 mg/kg would be lethal to mice and therefore
used it as the highest dose in our safety-evaluation 
experiments. We assessed the safety of CLR01 in 2-m old,
male, WT mice either 24 h following a single IP 
injection of 10 or 100 mg/kg (acute administration) or after
daily IP injection of 3 or 10 mg/kg for 30 days (chronic
administration). Following euthanasia, serum was 
collected for chemical analysis and tissues were harvested
for histopathology evaluation.
All CLR01-treated groups, except for the 100-mg/kg
acute-administration group, behaved indistinguishably
from control mice in terms of levels and type of activity
and grooming. The administration of 100-mg/kg CLR01
caused obvious signs of distress immediately, which
lasted for ~30 min following the injection. For most
mice, activity level decreased and eyelids became droopy.
Some of the mice exhibited arching of the back, sporadic
gasping, lying down, dragging one leg, and twitching.
These signs of distress diminished after the first 30 min,
at which point the mice resumed grooming and sitting
on hind legs. Some mice showed decreased activity and
droopy eyelids for up to 2 h following the injection. No
symptoms of severe toxicity, as defined by the UCLA
DLAM veterinarians, were observed for any mice, 
including bruising, bleeding, pale mucous membranes or
extremities, diarrhea, paralysis, tachypnea or dyspnea, or
abdominal distension.
Page 6 of 14
Liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were 
collected for histopathology analysis. Tissue samples from
heart, lung, spleen, and brain of all acutely 
CLR01-administered mice were indistinguishable from those of
control mice. In all 100-mg/kg-dosed mice and one of
eight 10-mg/kg-dosed mice of the acute-administration
groups, liver degeneration and necrosis was detected in
centrilobular and midlobular regions (Figure 3). Zonal
nature of liver toxicity is common in drug-toxicity 
studies and was expected in the high-dose group.
The fact that all the mice in the high-dose group 
survived meant that the actual therapeutic index could not
be calculated because contrary to our expectation,
100 mg/kg was under the lethal dose. However, we 
considered the observation of obvious liver toxicity at this
high dose as sufficient for determining the maximal dose
in future efficacy experiments and therefore did not treat
mice with higher doses. Rather, we conducted next a 
30-day, chronic-toxicity experiment in which mice were
administered IP either 3 or 10 mg/kg/day of CLR01. 
Because one mouse of the eight used in the 10-mg/kg
acute-administration group showed signs of liver 
toxicity, 10 mg/kg/day was chosen to be the highest dose in
this experiment.
Heart, lung, spleen, and brain from both chronically
CLR01-treated groups of mice were indistinguishable
from vehicle-treated mice and were free of signs of
malformation, degeneration, necrosis, or inflammation
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
within normal variability among mice. A few mice in the
3-mg/kg group showed signs of mild-to-moderate 
multi-focal extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver. The 
consulting veterinary pathologist concluded that this was
possibly immune-stimulated but not pathogenic. Mild
pancreatitis also was observed in one of the mice 
showing liver hematopoiesis and one additional mouse in the
3-mg/kg group. In contrast, no signs of tissue pathology
or liver necrosis were detected in any of the mice in the
10-mg/kg dosed group. Thus, it is unlikely that the
hematopoiesis or inflammation found in the low-dose
group were related to the CLR01 treatment.
Serum chemical analysis mainly consisted of tests of
renal and liver function (Table 1). No significant 
differences were observed between the control and low-dose
groups in either the acute-administration or 
chronic-administration experiments. The acute-administration,
100-mg/kg group showed significant increase in alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate
dehydrogenase, and a significant decrease in cholesterol
compared to both the control group and what is 
considered a normal range (UCLA DLAM, modified [23]). All
of these changes are consistent with acute liver injury.
Glucose levels were significantly lower in the 100-mg/kg
acute-administration group than in the control group,
but were within the normal range. Production of glucose
is often the last function to be lost in liver damage.
Other changes indicating liver damage, including
changes in concentrations of albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, or total bilirubin, were not observed. In the 
chronic-administration experiment, the only significant 
serum-chemistry difference observed was ~40% reduction in
Page 7 of 14
blood cholesterol in the 10-mg/kg group compared to
the control group. The cholesterol level was within the
normal range.
Pharmacokinetics of CLR01 in vivo
The plasma concentration of CLR01 was measured by
LC-MS in 2-m old WT mice following administration by
a SC or IV injection or by oral gavage. The SC 
bioavail-ability was found to be identical, within experimental
error, to the IV administration, which was considered as
100% bioavailable (Figure 4). In both routes, ~30% of the
administered dose was detected in the blood at the 
earliest time point measured - 20 min, and the plasma 
halflife was found to be ~2.5 h. Approximately 5% of the 
initial CLR01 levels were found in the plasma 8 h following
either SC or IV administration. Oral bioavailability was
negligible, suggesting that CLR01 gets metabolized in
the gastrointestinal tract and/or does not pass from the
gut to the blood.
Next, we asked what percentage of the administered
CLR01 penetrates through the BBB and gets into the
CNS. Our first attempt was to measure CLR01 in brain
extracts using LC-MS. However, this proved to be 
difficult. Due to the multiple negative charges of CLR01, its
partial protonation at physiologic pH, and the presence
of various counter-ions in biological fluids, the MS 
signal splits into multiple peaks resulting in low signal-to-
noise ratio. The difficulty to observe the CLR01 signal in
brain extracts using LC-MS suggested that the 
concentration was low and detection would necessitate 
considerable optimization of the extraction and LC-MS
methods, which would require substantial effort and
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
high costs. Therefore, we decided to test first whether
CLR01 could be found in the CNS by using a 
radiola-beled derivative of the compound.
As the permeability of the BBB has been shown to be
dependent on age and morbidity, and in particular to be
increased in AD [17] and in mouse models of AD
[24,25], we assessed how age and disease progression 
affected the brain penetration of CLR01 by using WT and
3×Tg mice at three different ages. The 3×Tg model was
chosen because it was used in a previous study, in which
CLR01 was found to reduce AD-like pathology in the
brain [5]. Mouse ages were chosen to correspond with:
1) a stage before Aβ burden and cognitive deficits are
found at 2-m of age [14,26]; 2) a stage with mild-to-
moderate plaque and tangle pathology but with 
observable memory deficits at 12-m of age [14,27]; and 3) a
stage of abundant plaque and tangle pathology with 
consistent behavioral deficits at 22-m of age [28]. Mice were
administered 3H-CLR01 IV, blood and brain were 
collected at time points between 0.5 − 72 h following
CLR01 administration, and radioactivity levels were
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity
is presented as CPM/g of brain or CPM/ml of blood.
To correct for the radioactivity associated with 
blood-borne 3H-CLR01 in the brain vasculature, we performed
both perfusion and subtraction analyses. In perfusion 
experiments, WT and 3×Tg mice at each of the three ages
analyzed (n = 3 per group) were perfused with 
phosphate buffered saline following euthanasia. Perfusion
lasted for either 5 min or until the liver changed color
from a red to yellow, whichever was longer. In other 
experiments, mice were not perfused, but radioactivity 
associated with 10 μl of blood per g of brain [29,30] was
calculated based on brain weight and blood radioactivity
levels and subtracted from brain radioactivity levels. At
Page 8 of 14
1 h post injection, perfusion-corrected brain values were
statistically similar to subtraction-corrected brain values
(Figure 5). Due to difficulties associated with the 
perfusion analysis, specifically liver color being used as an 
indirect readout of brain perfusion level, and because
including a perfusion step could increase variability
among experiments, the rest of the experiments utilized
the subtraction method, which is a common practice in
BBB-permeability studies [29,30].
At 0.5 h following injection, blood radioactivity levels
in 12-m old mice were 39 ± 13% and 40 ± 6% of the
injected levels, for WT and 3×Tg mice, respectively.
These values were in agreement with the CLR01 
concentration levels detected in plasma by LC-MS. About 5 −
10% of the radioactivity observed at time 0.5 h remained
in the blood after 8 h (Figure 6).
Brain-radioactivity levels, calculated as a percentage of
blood-radioactivity levels (CPM/g)/(CPM/ml) at 1 h 
following the injection ranged from 0.86-3.09% depending
on age and genotype (WT versus 3×Tg, Figure 7). 
Analysis of brain penetration levels at 1 h by absence or
presence of AD transgenes and by age showed a 
statistically significant effect of age but not of genotype. 
Interestingly however, 2-m old 3×Tg mice significantly
differed from 12-m and 24-m old 3×Tg mice (2-m: 3.09 ±
0.55%; 12-m: 1.43 ± 0.17%; 24-m: 1.45 ± 0.28%; p < 0.05),
whereas in the WT group, the only significant difference
was between the 2-m and 24-m old mice (2-m: 2.68 ±
0.31%; 12-m: 2.11 ± 0.69%; 24-m: 0.86 ± 0.17%; p < 0.05).
This suggests that changes in BBB permeability occur 
earlier and more sharply in 3×Tg mice compared to WT
mice.
Surprisingly, although blood radioactivity levels declined
rapidly (Figure 6), the radioactivity levels measured in the
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
brain did not change significantly up to 72 h 
post-injection (Figure 8). Brain radioactivity levels were 
insensitive to genotype or time after injection and thus the 24-h
time point was assessed only in the 22-m old mice (both
3×Tg and WT) and the 72-h time point was assessed only
in the 22-m old WT mice. Differences were statistically 
insignificant and within experimental error.
To explore further the mechanics of CLR01 transport
across the BBB, we asked whether the transport system
was saturated. To answer this question, we injected 
5-times the amount of total CLR01, keeping the ratio of
3H-CLR01:CLR01 at 1:9, into 22-m old WT mice. This
experiment resulted on average, in 5-times the absolute
amount of radioactivity detected in the brain. The 
percentage of brain penetration at 1 h following the injection
did not change significantly (1× CLR01 brain penetration:
0.86 ± 0.30% of blood; 5× CLR01 brain penetration: 0.97 ±
0.28% of blood; Figure 8). This result suggests that
the transport mechanism, whether active or passive, is
concentration-dependent because there was an increase in
the absolute value but not the relative value of CLR01 
entering the brain.
To begin to explore whether additional dosing would
increase the effective CLR01 concentration in the brain,
we injected 22-m old WT mice twice over two equal
time intervals and compared brain levels to mice that 
received one injection. On average, over the 1-, 3-, and 8-h
time points measured, the amount of radioactivity found
in the brain following the double-injection was twice the
amount measured following the single-injection protocol
(1 h: 3.3× compared to one injection, 3 h: 1.6×, 8 h:
1.9×; Figure 8). These data suggest that upon continuous
dosing, as with the SC osmotic mini-pumps used in our
previous efficacy study [5], CLR01 could reach 
sufficiently high brain concentration levels to inhibit Aβ
aggregation even though the dose was relatively low -
40 μg/kg/day - when brain penetration levels are taken
into account (see Discussion).
In vitro catabolism of CLR01
The BBB permeability experiments described above used
radioactivity as an indirect readout of CLR01 
concentration levels, which could have reflected the parent 
compound, CLR01 itself, or its metabolites. The question of
the source of radioactivity seemed particularly important
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
in view of the surprising persistence of radioactivity 
attributed to CLR01 in the brain. The most likely 
metabolism of CLR01 is cleavage of one or both phosphate
groups resulting in monophosphate and hydroquinone
derivatives, respectively (Figure 9). Each such 
dephosphorylation would decrease the polarity of the 
compound and increase its potential partition into the
lipophilic brain parenchyma environment relative to the
blood. In particular, the hydroquinone product is 
insoluble in aqueous solutions, in contrast to CLR01 and its
monophosphate metabolite, which are soluble at 
milli-molar concentrations. Thus, double dephosphorylation
could result in precipitation and accumulation of the
hydroquinone in the brain, potentially leading to 
misinterpretation of the BBB permeability data. Complete
analysis of CLR01 metabolism in the brain was beyond
the scope of the study described here. However, to
evaluate the potential for dephosphorylation, we 
incubated CLR01 in vitro with ALP or brain extracts and
measured the release of inorganic phosphate.
ALP is a widely distributed plasma enzyme found in
many tissues which can be released into body fluids [31].
The enzyme received its name because it shows optimal
activity at pH ~9. There are four isoforms of ALP: 
intestinal, placental, germ cell, and tissue non-specific. All
four isoforms are non-specific enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of a wide range of phosphate esters [32]. 
Tissue non-specific ALP concentration levels increase in
both brain and plasma of patients with familial or sporadic
AD relative to age-matched healthy individuals [33], 
possibly as a compensatory mechanism because the enzyme
catalyzes tau dephosphorylation [34].
Because of its promiscuous hydrolysis activity, we
tested whether calf intestinal ALP catalyzed CLR01 
dephosphorylation by incubating the molecular tweezer
with ALP and comparing the amount of inorganic 
phosphate released to a standard curve obtained by 
incubating ALP with increasing concentrations of a common
substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate. This standard curve
had a detection sensitivity limit of 5 nmol. Incubation of
Page 10 of 14
up to 100 nmol CLR01 with ALP resulted in undetectable
levels of inorganic phosphate, suggesting that despite its
promiscuity, ALP did not catalyze dephosphorylation of
CLR01.
To test whether CLR01 dephosphorylation might be
catalyzed by brain phosphatases other than ALP, we 
incubated 50 nmol CLR01 with 1.5 mg of mouse-brain
homogenate. The brain homogenate dephosphorylated
the positive control substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate,
at 99 − 130% of the activity of 0.8 enzymatic units of
ALP. In contrast, similarly to the reaction with ALP, no
release of inorganic phosphate was detected when the
brain homogenates were incubated with CLR01 under
the same conditions. Based on these results, 
dephosphorylation of CLR01 likely did not happen in our BBB
permeability experiments and the radioactivity measured
in mouse brains plausibly reflected CLR01 itself.
Discussion
Recently, we have reported that CLR01, an inhibitor of
aberrant assembly and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins
[3], protected primary neurons from Aβ-induced 
decrease in synaptic spine density, basal synaptic activity,
and long-term potentiation [5]. In addition, CLR01 
treatment of 15-m old 3×Tg mice with 40 μg/kg/day CLR01
for 28 days resulted in decreased AD-related brain 
pathology, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles,
and microglia levels [5]. In a mouse model of familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy, CLR01 significantly 
decreased transthyretin deposition and associated 
pathological markers, including ER stress, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis [15]. Following up on these promising efficacy
data, here, we explored the putative process-specific
mechanism of CLR01, its safety margin in mice, its BBB
permeability and how it might be affected by age and
disease, and the most likely route of CLR01 metabolism.
As stated above, no signs of toxicity have been 
observed in in vivo efficacy studies. Towards determining
optimal dosing for subsequent studies, we sought to find
out the lethal dose, which would provide an upper limit
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
for future dosing decisions. Effectively, we found that
our highest acute dose of 100 mg/kg was not lethal but
did elicit obvious behavioral signs of distress and liver
damage (Table 1). Thus, chronic dosing at this 
concentration could lead to mortality. Importantly, we found
that high doses of CLR01 had no effect on brain, heart,
lung, spleen, or kidney. Liver injury, found by both 
histology and serum analysis, was the main indicator of
acute toxicity. These data will be used to direct 
monitoring for potential toxicity in future studies using higher
doses than those used previously and potentially using
species other than mouse.
In the chronic-administration experiment, the only
meaningful finding was a decrease in cholesterol levels,
which were still within the normal range, in the 10-mg/
kg/day group (Table 1). This was an unexpected effect of
CLR01 treatment, and may be of interest for further 
exploration especially for dual treatment of AD as high
cholesterol in middle age is associated with increased
risk for AD [35,36]. Importantly, the chronically 
administered dose of 10 mg/kg/day is 250-times higher than
the efficacious dose of 40 μg/kg/day used in the AD
model [5] and thus provides a large safety margin. In
support of this conclusion, concentrations up to 300 μM
did not significantly affect the polymerization of tubulin
in vitro (Figure 2), suggesting that CLR01 does not 
inhibit physiologic protein assembly unless the 
concentrations used are substantially higher than those needed for
therapeutic effects.
Several previous observations support the safety of
CLR01. As mentioned above, in vivo, CLR01 decreased
significantly brain Aβ deposition without interfering with
APP processing [5], and inhibited α-synuclein 
aggregation but not its ubiquitination, which requires free Lys
residues [4]. In addition, when CLR01 was tested in vitro
as an inhibitor of enzymatic activity, the CLR01:enzyme
concentration ratio needed for inhibition was orders of
magnitude higher than the ratios needed for inhibition
of abnormal protein aggregation. Thus, CLR01 inhibited
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity with IC50 =
180 μM at ADH concentration of 208 nM [7]. Thus, the
CLR01:ADH ratio needed for inhibition was 865:1. In
another study, CLR01 was tested as an inhibitor of Poly
[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1). Inhibition was
found with an IC50 of 3.3 μM at an enzyme 
concentration of 2.3 nM (T. Schrader, unpublished results). The
ratio in this case was 1435:1. These findings support the
proposed process-specific mechanism and the 
development of molecular tweezers in general, and CLR01 in
particular, towards initiation of clinical trials.
It is important to note that animal dose should not be
extrapolated to a human equivalent dose by conversion
of body weight, but rather by normalization to body 
surface area [37]. This method correlates well with several
Page 11 of 14
parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, 
caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, 
circulating plasma proteins, and renal function [38]. An
extrapolation using the body surface area suggests that a
dosing window between 0.04 - 10 mg/kg/day in mice
corresponds to 0.003 − 0.81 mg/kg/day in humans.
Many of the properties of the BBB that determine the
extent to which drugs are taken up by the brain are
known to be altered in AD, such as disruption of tight
junctions, decreased CSF reabsorption, decreased 
cerebral blood flow, and decreased efflux pump activity [17].
Similar BBB compromise has been reported in animal
models of AD [24,25], thus, we set out to explore the
differences in CLR01 brain penetration in both WT and
the 3×Tg mouse model of AD. Because many of these
properties, such as CSF reabsorption and BBB 
disruption, are not simply binary, we chose animals at three
different ages, from 2 − 22-m, which correlate with 
different stages of disease progression, to evaluate the effect
of age and disease on drug uptake. Using 3H-labeled
CLR01, we found brain penetration levels between 1 −
3% in the different ages, whereas the absence or 
presence of AD transgenes had little effect on CLR01 uptake
into the brain (Figure 7). There was no statistically 
significant interaction between age and presence of AD
transgenes. However, we did find that 2-m old 3×Tg
mice differed significantly from 12-m and 22-m old
3×Tg mice. In comparison, in the WT group, the only
significant difference was between the 2-m and 22-m old
mice. These data suggest that the presence of the 
AD-related transgenes expedites the disintegration of the
BBB and thus increases the brain penetration of CLR01
by a small, yet potentially meaningful, amount. 
Unexpectedly, we found higher penetration of CLR01 in the
brains of the younger mice. One possible explanation of
these findings, assuming that CLR01 enters the brain by
a passive transport mechanism, is that the increased
BBB permeability observed at old age results in faster
leakage of CLR01 out of the brain than in the young
mice. Alternatively, CLR01 may be taken up by a 
serendipitous active transport system that is more efficient in
younger, than in older mice.
The observation that brain radioactivity did not 
decline with time (Figure 8) was peculiar. Linear regression
analysis of the values between 1-72 h for the 22-m old
WT mice resulted in a slope that was not significantly
different from zero. This unexpected behavior raised a
concern for a systematic error producing these data.
However, both the double-injection-, and the 5×-dose-
experiments showed a linear increase in brain 
radioactivity, suggesting that the radioactivity measured in the
brain reflected bona fide uptake of CLR01 through the
BBB. Another concern was that the radioactivity 
measured in the brain actually came from residual blood that
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
was not accounted for by either perfusion or subtraction
of the expected values. However, the observations that
blood CLR01 or 3H-CLR01 decreased to ~5% of the
starting values by 8 h (Figures 4 and 6) without a 
correlating decrease in brain radioactivity, which remained
steady over that same period, indicated that the 
radioactivity measured in the brain was not related to residual
blood levels. In addition, actual sample counts (≥500
CPM) were well above the minimum sensitivity of the
liquid scintillation counting system (background was
< 150 CPM). Thus, the radioactivity measured in the
brain reflected the actual 3H-CLR01 levels that 
penetrated the brain.
The observation that CLR01 penetration levels were
consistent among groups and persistent over time 
suggests that CLR01 enters the brain and accumulates with
parameters that are age-specific, as age was found to be
a significant determinant of BBB penetration (Figure 7).
One possible mechanism by which CLR01 passes across
the BBB is by binding to Lys residues on receptors that
span the membrane or get endocytosed. An analysis of
the amino acid sequence of four major human cellular
receptors involved in transferring cargo across the BBB -
transferrin, low density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1, glucose transporter 1, and large neutral amino acid
transporter - reveals that Lys makes up 3.3 − 6.6% of their
sequences. If these Lys residues are exposed and are 
positioned within the receptor’s channel, or get endocytosed
upon ligand binding, they may allow CLR01 to “hitchhike”
its way across the BBB through its labile binding to these
receptors and potentially through the transport of the
natural cargo.
An important question is whether the mechanism of
action of CLR01 in vivo is similar to, or different from,
its mechanism in vitro. Though complete 
characterization of the in vivo mechanism is difficult to achieve, an
important question is whether the stoichiometry of the
molecular tweezer and its target proteins is similar
in vitro and in vivo. Based on experiments using SC
pumps in which 0.7% of the administered CLR01 was in
the blood at steady-state (Lopes DHJ, Attar A, Du Z,
McDaniel K, Dutt S, Bravo-Rodriguez K, 
Ramirez-Anguita JM, Sancez-Garcia E, Klärner F-G, Wang C,
Schrader T, Bitan G: The molecular tweezer CLR01 
inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide assembly and toxicity via
an unexpected mechanism, submitted), the brain 
penetration of ~2% of blood levels found here, and the 
efficacy studies in the 15-m old 3×Tg mice using a 40-μg/
kg/day dose [5], we estimate that ~200 fmol of CLR01
enter the brain per day. A literature search for brain
concentration levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 resulted in 
reported values from zero to a maximum of 280 fmol/mg
brain [14]. The masses of the mouse brains used in our
studies were ~0.5 g. Thus, a total of ~140 fmol Aβ may
Page 12 of 14
be found at a given point in 13-m old 3×Tg mice [14].
Upon accumulation of CLR01 in the brain, as we 
observed in the double-injection experiment, the 
concentration levels of CLR01 entering the brain at a 40-μg/kg/
day dose and of Aβ are expected to be on the same
order of magnitude, specifically, in the range of 
hundreds of fmols. This is not to suggest that CLR01 does
not interact with all exposed Lys residues on any 
protein. It likely does. However, whereas the high on-off
rate of CLR01 binding to Lys residues [9] is unlikely to
disrupt stable protein structures significantly, because
self-association of amyloidogenic proteins depends on
the improbable formation of a nucleus comprising 
multiple monomers, presumably binding of CLR01 to a
small percentage of the monomers would be sufficient
for disruption of nucleus formation. The same rationale
is applicable to formation of metastable toxic oligomers,
which are made of multiple monomers. Thus, 
substoi-chiometric concentrations of CLR01 relative to its target
protein are expected to be sufficient for producing a
beneficial effect. The analysis outlined above suggests
that the intracranial Aβ:CLR01 stoichiometry achieved
in our in vivo study, in which we found substantial 
decrease in AD-like pathology [5], was similar to the 
stoichiometry in in vitro and cell culture experiments [3]
providing strong support for the putative mechanism of
action of CLR01.
The estimate of 200 fmol of CLR01 entering the brain
per day upon administration of 40 μg/kg/day [5] is a
conservative one, when considering two additional 
factors. First, the levels of CLR01 detected in the plasma
following an IV injection, which is considered 100% 
bio-available, were about 30% of amount injected. Thus, the
amount detected may reflect the limitation of the 
detection method and the CLR01 actual concentration in the
blood may be higher. Second, the cerebrovascular 
volume of the 3×Tg mice at 11-m of age has been shown to
be 26% lower than that of non-transgenic littermates,
potentially due to cerebrovascular amyloid deposition
[39]. We did not take this difference into account in our
correction for cerebral blood when calculating brain
radioactivity and thus might have biased our data to 
reflect lower radioactivity in the older 3×Tg mice than 
actual values. Taking these potential biases into account
lends additional support to the suggested mechanism of
action of CLR01 in vivo.
An important factor for development of CLR01 and/or
other molecular tweezer derivatives as therapeutic drugs
is identifying the active pharmaceutical ingredient. In
vitro data suggest that binding of CLR01 itself to free
Lys residues is what modulates the self-assembly of 
amyloidogenic proteins into non-amyloidogenic, non-toxic
species. However, in vivo, CLR01 may be metabolized in
currently unknown ways and the active pharmaceutical
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
ingredient may be a metabolite. To examine potential
CLR01 metabolism, previously, we tested the stability of
the compound in mouse and human, plasma and liver
microsomes and found 100% stability in all preparations
[5]. To explore the question of stability and potential
metabolism further, here, we hypothesized that the 
phosphate groups would be the most likely targets of 
metabolism and therefore asked whether they were substrates
for dephosphorylation by ALP or other brain 
phosphatases. The question was of particular importance in view
of the reported increase in ALP concentration in both
brain and plasma of patients with AD relative to healthy
individuals [33]. We tested the potential 
dephosphorylation of CLR01 under stringent conditions of excess ALP
in buffer and did not find release of inorganic phosphate
upon incubation of CLR01 with either the purified 
phosphatase or the brain extracts. A plausible explanation for
the observed stability of CLR01’s phosphate groups to
enzymatic dephosphorylation is the rigid structure of the
hydrocarbon backbone of the compound (Figures 1 and
9), which likely prevents its accommodation in the active
sites of phosphatases.
Process-specific modulation of amyloid protein 
assembly is a useful approach that can be adopted for a 
multitude of amyloidoses. The beneficial therapeutic effects of
CLR01 have been demonstrated in mouse models of AD
and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, and a zebrafish
model of Parkinson’s disease [11]. Here, we found a 
favorable safety profile and small yet persistent brain
penetration - a formidable starting point for future 
formal development of CLR01 towards human therapy.
Conclusion
A single dose of CLR01, at 2,500-fold the efficacious
dose, induced behavioral distress and liver injury, but
did not result in mortality. Daily dosing at 250-fold the
efficacious dose did not result in any signs of behavioral,
serological, or pathological toxicity. In vitro evaluation of
CLR01’s influence on physiologically normal protein 
assembly did not show disruption until 55-fold excess of
CLR01 was used. These results indicate a high safety
margin for CLR01. Brain penetration of CLR01 was 
observed to be ~2% of blood levels depending on age, yet
it was persistent for 3 days. These data were used to 
verify that sufficient levels of CLR01 are present
in the
brain for the putative mechanism of action.

Abstract
Background: The “molecular tweezer” CLR01 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of abnormal protein self-assembly,
which acts by binding selectively to Lys residues. CLR01 has been tested in several in vitro and in vivo models of
amyloidoses all without signs of toxicity. With the goal of developing CLR01 as a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer’s
disease and other amyloidoses, here we studied its safety and pharmacokinetics.
Methods: Toxicity studies were performed in 2-m old wild-type mice. Toxicity was evaluated by serum chemical
analysis, histopathology analysis, and qualitative behavioral analysis. Brain penetration studies were performed using
radiolabeled CLR01 in both wild-type mice and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease at 2-m, 12-m, and
22-m of age. Brain levels were measured from 0.5 − 72 h post administration.
Results: Examination of CLR01’s effect on tubulin polymerization, representing normal protein assembly, showed
disruption of the process only when 55-fold excess CLR01 was used, supporting the compound’s putative “process-
specific” mechanism of action.
A single-injection of 100 mg/kg CLR01 in mice - 2,500-fold higher than the efficacious dose reported previously,
induced temporary distress and liver injury, but no mortality. Daily injection of doses up to 10 mg/kg did not
produce any signs of toxicity, suggesting a high safety margin.
The brain penetration of CLR01 was found to be 1 − 3% of blood levels depending on age. Though CLR01 was
almost completely removed from the blood by 8 h, unexpectedly, brain levels of CLR01 remained steady over 72 h.
Conclusion: Estimation of brain levels compared to amyloid β-protein concentrations reported previously suggest
that the stoichiometry obtained in vitro and in vivo is similar, supporting the mechanism of action of CLR01.
The favorable safety margin of CLR01, together with efficacy shown in multiple animal models, support further
development of CLR01 as a disease-modifying agent for amyloidoses.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) along with over 30 other 
diseases, are amyloidoses, in which aberrant protein folding
and aggregation is a central pathologic process.

more proteins into toxic oligomers and insoluble 
amyloid. Currently, amyloidoses have no cure. Inhibition of

the aberrant aggregation process is highly challenging
because unlike traditional drug targets that have defined
structures and in many cases, specific binding sites or
active sites, toxic oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins
are metastable structures that sample numerous 
conformations and amyloid fibrils are characterized by flat 
surfaces. These structures largely are devoid of specific
binding pockets [1,2]. A possible solution to these 
challenges is to aim for one step prior to the unknown and
unfavorable structures, specifically targeting the 
aberrantly self-associating proteins at the level of amino acid
interactions.CA

Recently, we reported that the molecular tweezer,
CLR01, is a novel, broad-spectrum inhibitor of abnormal
protein self-assembly, which acts by a “process-specific”
mechanism and inhibits the aggregation and toxicity of
multiple amyloidogenic proteins [3-5]. CLR01 is a small
molecule, originally developed as an artificial Lys 
receptor [6,7] that binds Lys residues with low micromolar 
affinity [3,6] or in certain cases, sub-micromolar affinity
[8]. The binding is highly labile [9], yet it is selective to
Lys and involves inclusion of the Lys side-chain within
the tweezer cavity (Figure 1). CLR01 also binds to Arg
with ~10-fold lower affinity [7,10]. Selective binding to
Lys is achieved by a combination of hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions. Lys is the only proteinaceous
amino acid side-chain that effectively forms both types
of interactions - hydrophobic interactions involving the
butylene chain, and Coulombic attraction/repulsion of its
ε-NH3+ group. Both types of interactions are important in
aberrant protein self-assembly. Thus, CLR01 competes for
the same interactions that are key to nucleation and
aggregation by most amyloidogenic proteins [11,12].
The moderate-affinity binding of CLR01 to Lys is key
to its process-specific mechanism. Unlike the forces that
mediate normal protein biology, those that control the
abnormal assembly of amyloidogenic proteins were not
Page 2 of 14
optimized by evolution. Consequently, the binding 
energies involved are substantially weaker than those 
controlling normal protein structure and function. Therefore,
although CLR01 may bind to exposed Lys residues in 
virtually any protein, we reasoned that at sufficiently low
concentrations, labile binding with micromolar affinity
would only affect relatively weak interactions, such as
those that mediate aberrant protein oligomerization and
nucleation.
The data generated to date have supported our 
conjecture. In vitro studies of metabolic toxicity and drug-drug
interaction involving the cytochrome P450 system
showed minimal inhibition of five major isoforms with
half-maximal inhibition concentration values above levels
expected to cause drug-drug interactions [5]. Minimal 
activation of the cytochrome P450 system by CLR01 was 
detected up to 10-μM concentrations in a cell-culture
system compared to the antibiotic rifampicin, which was
used as a positive control [5]. In nerve growth 
factor-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cells treated with
CLR01, no toxicity was detected up to 200 μM, whereas a
mild decrease in cell viability was observed at 400 μM-1 −
3 orders of magnitude higher than concentrations needed
for inhibition of the toxicity of different amyloidogenic
proteins in cell culture [3,13].
In vivo, CLR01 prevented deformation and mortality
in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein (α-syn) toxicity by
keeping α-syn soluble, preventing its neurotoxic effects,
and promoting disinhibition of the 26S 
ubiquitin-proteasome system, thus allowing it to degrade the excess
α-syn [4]. Peripheral, subcutaneous (SC) administration of
CLR01 in a triple-transgenic (3×Tg) mouse model of AD
[14] resulted in a significant decrease in amyloid plaque
burden and hyperphosphorylated tau, with an 
accompanying decrease in microgliosis [5]. Similarly, peripheral 
administration of CLR01 in a mouse model of familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy expressing mutant 
transthyretin led to a significant decrease in transthyretin 
deposition and associated endoplasmic-reticulum stress,
apoptosis, and protein oxidation markers [15]. In support
of the putative process-specific mechanism of CLR01, no
signs of toxicity were observed in any of these studies.
CLR01 was used at up to 10 μM in the zebrafish model
(in the water environment [4]), at 40 μg/kg/day in the AD
mouse model [5], and at 1.2 mg/kg/day in the 
transthyretin model [15].
Further support for the proposed process-specific
mechanism came from the observation that CLR01 did
not affect processing of amyloid β-protein precursor
(APP) in the treated AD mice. In APP, Lys residues are
located N-terminally to the α- and β-secretase cleavage
sites. Ostensibly, CLR01 binding to these residues could
have affected APP processing. However, no differences
were found in levels of APP cleavage products between

brain extracts of vehicle- or CLR01-treated mice [5]. To
further examine the putative process-specific mechanism
and toxicity profile of CLR01, here we evaluated the
effect of the compound in vitro on a physiologic (as 
opposed to aberrant) protein self-assembly process-tubu-
lin polymerization-and in vivo using wild-type (WT)
mice to which CLR01 was administered at high doses 
either as a one-time bolus or daily for 1 month.
A large number of amyloidoses affect the central 
nervous system (CNS). If molecular tweezers are to be 
developed as drugs for these diseases, they likely will need
to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the 
AD-mouse-treatment study, SC administration of CLR01
resulted in clear CNS effects [5], suggesting that the
compound penetrated through the BBB into the brain of
the mice. However, in that study we only began to 
measure the brain penetration levels and did not address the
effect of age or disease. The BBB becomes compromised
with aging [16] and this compromise is thought to be 
exacerbated in patients with certain neurodegenerative 
diseases, including AD [17-19]. Previously, using 3H-CLR01
injected intravenously, we found radioactivity levels in the
brain to be ~2% of blood levels in 12-m old WTand 3×Tg
AD mice [5]. We present here a characterization of the
BBB’s permeability to CLR01 and the effects of age and
presence of AD-linked transgenes. We also assess a likely
route of metabolism of CLR01 in mouse brain.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Recently, we have reported that CLR01, an inhibitor of
aberrant assembly and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins
[3], protected primary neurons from Aβ-induced 
decrease in synaptic spine density, basal synaptic activity,
and long-term potentiation [5]. In addition, CLR01 
treatment of 15-m old 3×Tg mice with 40 μg/kg/day CLR01
for 28 days resulted in decreased AD-related brain 
pathology, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles,
and microglia levels [5]. In a mouse model of familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy, CLR01 significantly 
decreased transthyretin deposition and associated 
pathological markers, including ER stress, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis [15]. Following up on these promising efficacy
data, here, we explored the putative process-specific
mechanism of CLR01, its safety margin in mice, its BBB
permeability and how it might be affected by age and
disease, and the most likely route of CLR01 metabolism.
As stated above, no signs of toxicity have been 
observed in in vivo efficacy studies. Towards determining
optimal dosing for subsequent studies, we sought to find
out the lethal dose, which would provide an upper limit
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
for future dosing decisions. Effectively, we found that
our highest acute dose of 100 mg/kg was not lethal but
did elicit obvious behavioral signs of distress and liver
damage (Table 1). Thus, chronic dosing at this 
concentration could lead to mortality. Importantly, we found
that high doses of CLR01 had no effect on brain, heart,
lung, spleen, or kidney. Liver injury, found by both 
histology and serum analysis, was the main indicator of
acute toxicity. These data will be used to direct 
monitoring for potential toxicity in future studies using higher
doses than those used previously and potentially using
species other than mouse.
In the chronic-administration experiment, the only
meaningful finding was a decrease in cholesterol levels,
which were still within the normal range, in the 10-mg/
kg/day group (Table 1). This was an unexpected effect of
CLR01 treatment, and may be of interest for further 
exploration especially for dual treatment of AD as high
cholesterol in middle age is associated with increased
risk for AD [35,36]. Importantly, the chronically 
administered dose of 10 mg/kg/day is 250-times higher than
the efficacious dose of 40 μg/kg/day used in the AD
model [5] and thus provides a large safety margin. In
support of this conclusion, concentrations up to 300 μM
did not significantly affect the polymerization of tubulin
in vitro (Figure 2), suggesting that CLR01 does not 
inhibit physiologic protein assembly unless the 
concentrations used are substantially higher than those needed for
therapeutic effects.
Several previous observations support the safety of
CLR01. As mentioned above, in vivo, CLR01 decreased
significantly brain Aβ deposition without interfering with
APP processing [5], and inhibited α-synuclein 
aggregation but not its ubiquitination, which requires free Lys
residues [4]. In addition, when CLR01 was tested in vitro
as an inhibitor of enzymatic activity, the CLR01:enzyme
concentration ratio needed for inhibition was orders of
magnitude higher than the ratios needed for inhibition
of abnormal protein aggregation. Thus, CLR01 inhibited
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity with IC50 =
180 μM at ADH concentration of 208 nM [7]. Thus, the
CLR01:ADH ratio needed for inhibition was 865:1. In
another study, CLR01 was tested as an inhibitor of Poly
[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1). Inhibition was
found with an IC50 of 3.3 μM at an enzyme 
concentration of 2.3 nM (T. Schrader, unpublished results). The
ratio in this case was 1435:1. These findings support the
proposed process-specific mechanism and the 
development of molecular tweezers in general, and CLR01 in
particular, towards initiation of clinical trials.
It is important to note that animal dose should not be
extrapolated to a human equivalent dose by conversion
of body weight, but rather by normalization to body 
surface area [37]. This method correlates well with several
Page 11 of 14
parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, 
caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, 
circulating plasma proteins, and renal function [38]. An
extrapolation using the body surface area suggests that a
dosing window between 0.04 - 10 mg/kg/day in mice
corresponds to 0.003 − 0.81 mg/kg/day in humans.
Many of the properties of the BBB that determine the
extent to which drugs are taken up by the brain are
known to be altered in AD, such as disruption of tight
junctions, decreased CSF reabsorption, decreased 
cerebral blood flow, and decreased efflux pump activity [17].
Similar BBB compromise has been reported in animal
models of AD [24,25], thus, we set out to explore the
differences in CLR01 brain penetration in both WT and
the 3×Tg mouse model of AD. Because many of these
properties, such as CSF reabsorption and BBB 
disruption, are not simply binary, we chose animals at three
different ages, from 2 − 22-m, which correlate with 
different stages of disease progression, to evaluate the effect
of age and disease on drug uptake. Using 3H-labeled
CLR01, we found brain penetration levels between 1 −
3% in the different ages, whereas the absence or 
presence of AD transgenes had little effect on CLR01 uptake
into the brain (Figure 7). There was no statistically 
significant interaction between age and presence of AD
transgenes. However, we did find that 2-m old 3×Tg
mice differed significantly from 12-m and 22-m old
3×Tg mice. In comparison, in the WT group, the only
significant difference was between the 2-m and 22-m old
mice. These data suggest that the presence of the 
AD-related transgenes expedites the disintegration of the
BBB and thus increases the brain penetration of CLR01
by a small, yet potentially meaningful, amount. 
Unexpectedly, we found higher penetration of CLR01 in the
brains of the younger mice. One possible explanation of
these findings, assuming that CLR01 enters the brain by
a passive transport mechanism, is that the increased
BBB permeability observed at old age results in faster
leakage of CLR01 out of the brain than in the young
mice. Alternatively, CLR01 may be taken up by a 
serendipitous active transport system that is more efficient in
younger, than in older mice.
The observation that brain radioactivity did not 
decline with time (Figure 8) was peculiar. Linear regression
analysis of the values between 1-72 h for the 22-m old
WT mice resulted in a slope that was not significantly
different from zero. This unexpected behavior raised a
concern for a systematic error producing these data.
However, both the double-injection-, and the 5×-dose-
experiments showed a linear increase in brain 
radioactivity, suggesting that the radioactivity measured in the
brain reflected bona fide uptake of CLR01 through the
BBB. Another concern was that the radioactivity 
measured in the brain actually came from residual blood that
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
was not accounted for by either perfusion or subtraction
of the expected values. However, the observations that
blood CLR01 or 3H-CLR01 decreased to ~5% of the
starting values by 8 h (Figures 4 and 6) without a 
correlating decrease in brain radioactivity, which remained
steady over that same period, indicated that the 
radioactivity measured in the brain was not related to residual
blood levels. In addition, actual sample counts (≥500
CPM) were well above the minimum sensitivity of the
liquid scintillation counting system (background was
< 150 CPM). Thus, the radioactivity measured in the
brain reflected the actual 3H-CLR01 levels that 
penetrated the brain.
The observation that CLR01 penetration levels were
consistent among groups and persistent over time 
suggests that CLR01 enters the brain and accumulates with
parameters that are age-specific, as age was found to be
a significant determinant of BBB penetration (Figure 7).
One possible mechanism by which CLR01 passes across
the BBB is by binding to Lys residues on receptors that
span the membrane or get endocytosed. An analysis of
the amino acid sequence of four major human cellular
receptors involved in transferring cargo across the BBB -
transferrin, low density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1, glucose transporter 1, and large neutral amino acid
transporter - reveals that Lys makes up 3.3 − 6.6% of their
sequences. If these Lys residues are exposed and are 
positioned within the receptor’s channel, or get endocytosed
upon ligand binding, they may allow CLR01 to “hitchhike”
its way across the BBB through its labile binding to these
receptors and potentially through the transport of the
natural cargo.
An important question is whether the mechanism of
action of CLR01 in vivo is similar to, or different from,
its mechanism in vitro. Though complete 
characterization of the in vivo mechanism is difficult to achieve, an
important question is whether the stoichiometry of the
molecular tweezer and its target proteins is similar
in vitro and in vivo. Based on experiments using SC
pumps in which 0.7% of the administered CLR01 was in
the blood at steady-state (Lopes DHJ, Attar A, Du Z,
McDaniel K, Dutt S, Bravo-Rodriguez K, 
Ramirez-Anguita JM, Sancez-Garcia E, Klärner F-G, Wang C,
Schrader T, Bitan G: The molecular tweezer CLR01 
inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide assembly and toxicity via
an unexpected mechanism, submitted), the brain 
penetration of ~2% of blood levels found here, and the 
efficacy studies in the 15-m old 3×Tg mice using a 40-μg/
kg/day dose [5], we estimate that ~200 fmol of CLR01
enter the brain per day. A literature search for brain
concentration levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 resulted in 
reported values from zero to a maximum of 280 fmol/mg
brain [14]. The masses of the mouse brains used in our
studies were ~0.5 g. Thus, a total of ~140 fmol Aβ may
Page 12 of 14
be found at a given point in 13-m old 3×Tg mice [14].
Upon accumulation of CLR01 in the brain, as we 
observed in the double-injection experiment, the 
concentration levels of CLR01 entering the brain at a 40-μg/kg/
day dose and of Aβ are expected to be on the same
order of magnitude, specifically, in the range of 
hundreds of fmols. This is not to suggest that CLR01 does
not interact with all exposed Lys residues on any 
protein. It likely does. However, whereas the high on-off
rate of CLR01 binding to Lys residues [9] is unlikely to
disrupt stable protein structures significantly, because
self-association of amyloidogenic proteins depends on
the improbable formation of a nucleus comprising 
multiple monomers, presumably binding of CLR01 to a
small percentage of the monomers would be sufficient
for disruption of nucleus formation. The same rationale
is applicable to formation of metastable toxic oligomers,
which are made of multiple monomers. Thus, 
substoi-chiometric concentrations of CLR01 relative to its target
protein are expected to be sufficient for producing a
beneficial effect. The analysis outlined above suggests
that the intracranial Aβ:CLR01 stoichiometry achieved
in our in vivo study, in which we found substantial 
decrease in AD-like pathology [5], was similar to the 
stoichiometry in in vitro and cell culture experiments [3]
providing strong support for the putative mechanism of
action of CLR01.
The estimate of 200 fmol of CLR01 entering the brain
per day upon administration of 40 μg/kg/day [5] is a
conservative one, when considering two additional 
factors. First, the levels of CLR01 detected in the plasma
following an IV injection, which is considered 100% 
bio-available, were about 30% of amount injected. Thus, the
amount detected may reflect the limitation of the 
detection method and the CLR01 actual concentration in the
blood may be higher. Second, the cerebrovascular 
volume of the 3×Tg mice at 11-m of age has been shown to
be 26% lower than that of non-transgenic littermates,
potentially due to cerebrovascular amyloid deposition
[39]. We did not take this difference into account in our
correction for cerebral blood when calculating brain
radioactivity and thus might have biased our data to 
reflect lower radioactivity in the older 3×Tg mice than 
actual values. Taking these potential biases into account
lends additional support to the suggested mechanism of
action of CLR01 in vivo.
An important factor for development of CLR01 and/or
other molecular tweezer derivatives as therapeutic drugs
is identifying the active pharmaceutical ingredient. In
vitro data suggest that binding of CLR01 itself to free
Lys residues is what modulates the self-assembly of 
amyloidogenic proteins into non-amyloidogenic, non-toxic
species. However, in vivo, CLR01 may be metabolized in
currently unknown ways and the active pharmaceutical
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
ingredient may be a metabolite. To examine potential
CLR01 metabolism, previously, we tested the stability of
the compound in mouse and human, plasma and liver
microsomes and found 100% stability in all preparations
[5]. To explore the question of stability and potential
metabolism further, here, we hypothesized that the 
phosphate groups would be the most likely targets of 
metabolism and therefore asked whether they were substrates
for dephosphorylation by ALP or other brain 
phosphatases. The question was of particular importance in view
of the reported increase in ALP concentration in both
brain and plasma of patients with AD relative to healthy
individuals [33]. We tested the potential 
dephosphorylation of CLR01 under stringent conditions of excess ALP
in buffer and did not find release of inorganic phosphate
upon incubation of CLR01 with either the purified 
phosphatase or the brain extracts. A plausible explanation for
the observed stability of CLR01’s phosphate groups to
enzymatic dephosphorylation is the rigid structure of the
hydrocarbon backbone of the compound (Figures 1 and
9), which likely prevents its accommodation in the active
sites of phosphatases.
Process-specific modulation of amyloid protein 
assembly is a useful approach that can be adopted for a 
multitude of amyloidoses. The beneficial therapeutic effects of
CLR01 have been demonstrated in mouse models of AD
and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, and a zebrafish
model of Parkinson’s disease [11]. Here, we found a 
favorable safety profile and small yet persistent brain
penetration - a formidable starting point for future 
formal development of CLR01 towards human therapy.

Results
In vitro examination of the process-specific mechanism
of CLR01
As stated above, the mechanism by which CLR01 
remodels the assembly of amyloidogenic proteins into
non-toxic assemblies that can be degraded by normal
clearance mechanisms is by its specific binding to Lys
residues. The mechanism is “process-specific” because it
is postulated to affect only the aberrant assembly of 
proteins that leads to toxic oligomers and aggregates, but
not normal protein structure, function, or assembly as
happens, e.g., in tubulin polymerization. To test whether
this indeed is the case, we examined the effect of CLR01
on tubulin polymerization [21,22]. Three mg/ml (~18 μM)
porcine brain tubulin, which contains 3.8% Lys and 4.8%
Arg, was allowed to polymerize in the absence or presence
of CLR01 concentrations ranging from 10-1,000 μM.
In the absence of CLR01 or in the presence of up to
300 μM of the compound, the change in turbidity
followed a typical sigmoidal curve, starting at 0.05-0.09
absorbance units (Figure 2). The absorbance remained
unchanged for the first 10-15 minutes, which is a typical
lag phase in this reaction, and then increased gradually
up to ~60 min, at which point the rate of increase began
to decline, and the reaction was followed for another
10 min. The only concentration at which significant
modulation of the polymerization was observed was
Page 5 of 14
1,000 μM (Figure 2, blue curve), i.e., at a tubulin:CLR01
concentration ratio ~1:55. At this high ratio, a high 
absorbance, 0.15, was observed immediately, followed by a
slight gradual decline during the lag phase. Then, the 
absorbance began to increase for 30 min, followed by a
slow decline for the rest of the experiment. One 
interpretation of these data is that at the high concentration
used, 1,000 μM, binding of CLR01 to tubulin induced
immediate self-assembly into irregular aggregates. 
Similar immediate induction of self-assembly was observed
with 4 of the 9 amyloidogenic proteins tested by Sinha
et al. [3], suggesting that this reaction occurs with some,
but not all proteins. In all the cases studied by Sinha
et al., these aggregates were non-amyloidogenic and
non-toxic.
Presumably, following the immediate aggregation in
the presence of 1,000 μM CLR01, the irregular tubulin
aggregates observed at t = 0 partially disassembled as the
polymerization reaction progressed, between 10-30 min.
At that point, the high CLR01 concentration appeared
to interfere with the polymerization reaction and the
tubulin polymers gradually disassembled. Validation of
this interpretation will require further investigation, yet
it was not the focus of the current study.
The motivation for this experiment was to test
whether the concentration of CLR01 needed to interfere
with a controlled self-assembly process was substantially
different from that required for modulation of aberrant
self-assembly, which was found indeed to be the case.
Most of the protein:CLR01 concentration ratios needed
for inhibition of amyloidogenic protein aggregation were
in the range 1:1-1:3 [3], compared to the 1:55 tubulin:
CLR01 concentration ratio at which disruption of 
tubulin polymerization was observed. These results support
the specificity of CLR01 for inhibition of aberrant 
aggregation as opposed to controlled polymerization.
CLR01 safety
If CLR01 indeed operates by a process-specific 
mechanism and remodels the abnormal aggregation of 
amyloidogenic proteins at substantially lower concentrations
than concentrations that would perturb normal 
physiological processes, one would expect the compound to
have a high therapeutic index. To calculate the 
therapeutic index, a lethal dose must be reached. The in vitro
data described above suggested that disruption of 
tubulin polymerization occurs at concentration ratios 20-50
times higher than those needed for inhibition of 
aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. In addition, cell 
culture experiments indicated that CLR01 began to show
toxicity at concentrations 1-3 orders of magnitude
higher than those required for inhibition of toxicity by
different amyloidogenic proteins [3,4]. The next rational
step was to test the safety margin of CLR01 in vivo.

Based on the in vitro and cell culture data, we expected
that 100 mg/kg would be lethal to mice and therefore
used it as the highest dose in our safety-evaluation 
experiments. We assessed the safety of CLR01 in 2-m old,
male, WT mice either 24 h following a single IP 
injection of 10 or 100 mg/kg (acute administration) or after
daily IP injection of 3 or 10 mg/kg for 30 days (chronic
administration). Following euthanasia, serum was 
collected for chemical analysis and tissues were harvested
for histopathology evaluation.
All CLR01-treated groups, except for the 100-mg/kg
acute-administration group, behaved indistinguishably
from control mice in terms of levels and type of activity
and grooming. The administration of 100-mg/kg CLR01
caused obvious signs of distress immediately, which
lasted for ~30 min following the injection. For most
mice, activity level decreased and eyelids became droopy.
Some of the mice exhibited arching of the back, sporadic
gasping, lying down, dragging one leg, and twitching.
These signs of distress diminished after the first 30 min,
at which point the mice resumed grooming and sitting
on hind legs. Some mice showed decreased activity and
droopy eyelids for up to 2 h following the injection. No
symptoms of severe toxicity, as defined by the UCLA
DLAM veterinarians, were observed for any mice, 
including bruising, bleeding, pale mucous membranes or
extremities, diarrhea, paralysis, tachypnea or dyspnea, or
abdominal distension.
Page 6 of 14
Liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were 
collected for histopathology analysis. Tissue samples from
heart, lung, spleen, and brain of all acutely 
CLR01-administered mice were indistinguishable from those of
control mice. In all 100-mg/kg-dosed mice and one of
eight 10-mg/kg-dosed mice of the acute-administration
groups, liver degeneration and necrosis was detected in
centrilobular and midlobular regions (Figure 3). Zonal
nature of liver toxicity is common in drug-toxicity 
studies and was expected in the high-dose group.
The fact that all the mice in the high-dose group 
survived meant that the actual therapeutic index could not
be calculated because contrary to our expectation,
100 mg/kg was under the lethal dose. However, we 
considered the observation of obvious liver toxicity at this
high dose as sufficient for determining the maximal dose
in future efficacy experiments and therefore did not treat
mice with higher doses. Rather, we conducted next a 
30-day, chronic-toxicity experiment in which mice were
administered IP either 3 or 10 mg/kg/day of CLR01. 
Because one mouse of the eight used in the 10-mg/kg
acute-administration group showed signs of liver 
toxicity, 10 mg/kg/day was chosen to be the highest dose in
this experiment.
Heart, lung, spleen, and brain from both chronically
CLR01-treated groups of mice were indistinguishable
from vehicle-treated mice and were free of signs of
malformation, degeneration, necrosis, or inflammation
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
within normal variability among mice. A few mice in the
3-mg/kg group showed signs of mild-to-moderate 
multi-focal extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver. The 
consulting veterinary pathologist concluded that this was
possibly immune-stimulated but not pathogenic. Mild
pancreatitis also was observed in one of the mice 
showing liver hematopoiesis and one additional mouse in the
3-mg/kg group. In contrast, no signs of tissue pathology
or liver necrosis were detected in any of the mice in the
10-mg/kg dosed group. Thus, it is unlikely that the
hematopoiesis or inflammation found in the low-dose
group were related to the CLR01 treatment.
Serum chemical analysis mainly consisted of tests of
renal and liver function (Table 1). No significant 
differences were observed between the control and low-dose
groups in either the acute-administration or 
chronic-administration experiments. The acute-administration,
100-mg/kg group showed significant increase in alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate
dehydrogenase, and a significant decrease in cholesterol
compared to both the control group and what is 
considered a normal range (UCLA DLAM, modified [23]). All
of these changes are consistent with acute liver injury.
Glucose levels were significantly lower in the 100-mg/kg
acute-administration group than in the control group,
but were within the normal range. Production of glucose
is often the last function to be lost in liver damage.
Other changes indicating liver damage, including
changes in concentrations of albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, or total bilirubin, were not observed. In the 
chronic-administration experiment, the only significant 
serum-chemistry difference observed was ~40% reduction in
Page 7 of 14
blood cholesterol in the 10-mg/kg group compared to
the control group. The cholesterol level was within the
normal range.
Pharmacokinetics of CLR01 in vivo
The plasma concentration of CLR01 was measured by
LC-MS in 2-m old WT mice following administration by
a SC or IV injection or by oral gavage. The SC 
bioavailability was found to be identical, within experimental
error, to the IV administration, which was considered as
100% bioavailable (Figure 4). In both routes, ~30% of the
administered dose was detected in the blood at the 
earliest time point measured - 20 min, and the plasma 
halflife was found to be ~2.5 h. Approximately 5% of the 
initial CLR01 levels were found in the plasma 8 h following
either SC or IV administration. Oral bioavailability was
negligible, suggesting that CLR01 gets metabolized in
the gastrointestinal tract and/or does not pass from the
gut to the blood.
Next, we asked what percentage of the administered
CLR01 penetrates through the BBB and gets into the
CNS. Our first attempt was to measure CLR01 in brain
extracts using LC-MS. However, this proved to be 
difficult. Due to the multiple negative charges of CLR01, its
partial protonation at physiologic pH, and the presence
of various counter-ions in biological fluids, the MS 
signal splits into multiple peaks resulting in low signal-to-
noise ratio. The difficulty to observe the CLR01 signal in
brain extracts using LC-MS suggested that the 
concentration was low and detection would necessitate 
considerable optimization of the extraction and LC-MS
methods, which would require substantial effort and
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
high costs. Therefore, we decided to test first whether
CLR01 could be found in the CNS by using a 
radiolabeled derivative of the compound.
As the permeability of the BBB has been shown to be
dependent on age and morbidity, and in particular to be
increased in AD [17] and in mouse models of AD
[24,25], we assessed how age and disease progression 
affected the brain penetration of CLR01 by using WT and
3×Tg mice at three different ages. The 3×Tg model was
chosen because it was used in a previous study, in which
CLR01 was found to reduce AD-like pathology in the
brain [5]. Mouse ages were chosen to correspond with:
1) a stage before Aβ burden and cognitive deficits are
found at 2-m of age [14,26]; 2) a stage with mild-to-
moderate plaque and tangle pathology but with 
observable memory deficits at 12-m of age [14,27]; and 3) a
stage of abundant plaque and tangle pathology with 
consistent behavioral deficits at 22-m of age [28]. Mice were
administered 3H-CLR01 IV, blood and brain were 
collected at time points between 0.5 − 72 h following
CLR01 administration, and radioactivity levels were
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity
is presented as CPM/g of brain or CPM/ml of blood.
To correct for the radioactivity associated with 
blood-borne 3H-CLR01 in the brain vasculature, we performed
both perfusion and subtraction analyses. In perfusion 
experiments, WT and 3×Tg mice at each of the three ages
analyzed (n = 3 per group) were perfused with 
phosphate buffered saline following euthanasia. Perfusion
lasted for either 5 min or until the liver changed color
from a red to yellow, whichever was longer. In other 
experiments, mice were not perfused, but radioactivity 
associated with 10 μl of blood per g of brain [29,30] was
calculated based on brain weight and blood radioactivity
levels and subtracted from brain radioactivity levels. At
Page 8 of 14
1 h post injection, perfusion-corrected brain values were
statistically similar to subtraction-corrected brain values
(Figure 5). Due to difficulties associated with the 
perfusion analysis, specifically liver color being used as an 
indirect readout of brain perfusion level, and because
including a perfusion step could increase variability
among experiments, the rest of the experiments utilized
the subtraction method, which is a common practice in
BBB-permeability studies [29,30].
At 0.5 h following injection, blood radioactivity levels
in 12-m old mice were 39 ± 13% and 40 ± 6% of the
injected levels, for WT and 3×Tg mice, respectively.
These values were in agreement with the CLR01 
concentration levels detected in plasma by LC-MS. About 5 −
10% of the radioactivity observed at time 0.5 h remained
in the blood after 8 h (Figure 6).
Brain-radioactivity levels, calculated as a percentage of
blood-radioactivity levels (CPM/g)/(CPM/ml) at 1 h 
following the injection ranged from 0.86-3.09% depending
on age and genotype (WT versus 3×Tg, Figure 7). 
Analysis of brain penetration levels at 1 h by absence or
presence of AD transgenes and by age showed a 
statistically significant effect of age but not of genotype. 
Interestingly however, 2-m old 3×Tg mice significantly
differed from 12-m and 24-m old 3×Tg mice (2-m: 3.09 ±
0.55%; 12-m: 1.43 ± 0.17%; 24-m: 1.45 ± 0.28%; p < 0.05),
whereas in the WT group, the only significant difference
was between the 2-m and 24-m old mice (2-m: 2.68 ±
0.31%; 12-m: 2.11 ± 0.69%; 24-m: 0.86 ± 0.17%; p < 0.05).
This suggests that changes in BBB permeability occur 
earlier and more sharply in 3×Tg mice compared to WT
mice.
Surprisingly, although blood radioactivity levels declined
rapidly (Figure 6), the radioactivity levels measured in the
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
brain did not change significantly up to 72 h 
post-injection (Figure 8). Brain radioactivity levels were 
insensitive to genotype or time after injection and thus the 24-h
time point was assessed only in the 22-m old mice (both
3×Tg and WT) and the 72-h time point was assessed only
in the 22-m old WT mice. Differences were statistically 
insignificant and within experimental error.
To explore further the mechanics of CLR01 transport
across the BBB, we asked whether the transport system
was saturated. To answer this question, we injected 
5-times the amount of total CLR01, keeping the ratio of
3H-CLR01:CLR01 at 1:9, into 22-m old WT mice. This
experiment resulted on average, in 5-times the absolute
amount of radioactivity detected in the brain. The 
percentage of brain penetration at 1 h following the injection
did not change significantly (1× CLR01 brain penetration:
0.86 ± 0.30% of blood; 5× CLR01 brain penetration: 0.97 ±
0.28% of blood; Figure 8). This result suggests that
the transport mechanism, whether active or passive, is
concentration-dependent because there was an increase in
the absolute value but not the relative value of CLR01 
entering the brain.
To begin to explore whether additional dosing would
increase the effective CLR01 concentration in the brain,
we injected 22-m old WT mice twice over two equal
time intervals and compared brain levels to mice that 
received one injection. On average, over the 1-, 3-, and 8-h
time points measured, the amount of radioactivity found
in the brain following the double-injection was twice the
amount measured following the single-injection protocol
(1 h: 3.3× compared to one injection, 3 h: 1.6×, 8 h:
1.9×; Figure 8). These data suggest that upon continuous
dosing, as with the SC osmotic mini-pumps used in our
previous efficacy study [5], CLR01 could reach 
sufficiently high brain concentration levels to inhibit Aβ
aggregation even though the dose was relatively low -
40 μg/kg/day - when brain penetration levels are taken
into account (see Discussion).
In vitro catabolism of CLR01
The BBB permeability experiments described above used
radioactivity as an indirect readout of CLR01 
concentration levels, which could have reflected the parent 
compound, CLR01 itself, or its metabolites. The question of
the source of radioactivity seemed particularly important
Attar et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/23
in view of the surprising persistence of radioactivity 
attributed to CLR01 in the brain. The most likely 
metabolism of CLR01 is cleavage of one or both phosphate
groups resulting in monophosphate and hydroquinone
derivatives, respectively (Figure 9). Each such 
dephosphorylation would decrease the polarity of the 
compound and increase its potential partition into the
lipophilic brain parenchyma environment relative to the
blood. In particular, the hydroquinone product is 
insoluble in aqueous solutions, in contrast to CLR01 and its
monophosphate metabolite, which are soluble at 
milli-molar concentrations. Thus, double dephosphorylation
could result in precipitation and accumulation of the
hydroquinone in the brain, potentially leading to 
misinterpretation of the BBB permeability data. Complete
analysis of CLR01 metabolism in the brain was beyond
the scope of the study described here. However, to
evaluate the potential for dephosphorylation, we 
incubated CLR01 in vitro with ALP or brain extracts and
measured the release of inorganic phosphate.
ALP is a widely distributed plasma enzyme found in
many tissues which can be released into body fluids [31].
The enzyme received its name because it shows optimal
activity at pH ~9. There are four isoforms of ALP: 
intestinal, placental, germ cell, and tissue non-specific. All
four isoforms are non-specific enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of a wide range of phosphate esters [32]. 
Tissue non-specific ALP concentration levels increase in
both brain and plasma of patients with familial or sporadic
AD relative to age-matched healthy individuals [33], 
possibly as a compensatory mechanism because the enzyme
catalyzes tau dephosphorylation [34].
Because of its promiscuous hydrolysis activity, we
tested whether calf intestinal ALP catalyzed CLR01 
dephosphorylation by incubating the molecular tweezer
with ALP and comparing the amount of inorganic 
phosphate released to a standard curve obtained by 
incubating ALP with increasing concentrations of a common
substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate. This standard curve
had a detection sensitivity limit of 5 nmol. Incubation of
Page 10 of 14
up to 100 nmol CLR01 with ALP resulted in undetectable
levels of inorganic phosphate, suggesting that despite its
promiscuity, ALP did not catalyze dephosphorylation of
CLR01.
To test whether CLR01 dephosphorylation might be
catalyzed by brain phosphatases other than ALP, we 
incubated 50 nmol CLR01 with 1.5 mg of mouse-brain
homogenate. The brain homogenate dephosphorylated
the positive control substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate,
at 99 − 130% of the activity of 0.8 enzymatic units of
ALP. In contrast, similarly to the reaction with ALP, no
release of inorganic phosphate was detected when the
brain homogenates were incubated with CLR01 under
the same conditions. Based on these results, 
dephosphorylation of CLR01 likely did not happen in our BBB
permeability experiments and the radioactivity measured
in mouse brains plausibly reflected CLR01 itself.
