Conclusions
In conclusion, intrapulmonary administration of PFOB
and PFOC appeared to be well tolerated regarding 
respiratory function and gas exchanges after awakening in
pigs. PFOC was rapidly cleared from the lung and 
virtually disappeared after 4 days whereas PFOB persisted at
significant levels and led to foam macrophage 
infiltration. PFOC could be relevant in the setting of 
intrapul-monary administration for short durations, e.g., for total
liquid ventilation induced-cooling. In comparison, PFD

was poorly tolerated and compromised gas exchange,
probably as a consequence of large PFC residues.

Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with French
regulations after approval by the local ethical committee
(Ethical committee #16 of the “Comité National de Réfle-
xion Ethique sur l’Expérimentation Animale”; Additional
file 1). All experiments were performed in laboratory
female pigs crossed between Large White and Landrace
(≈25 kg and ≈ 3 months), after an appropriate control of
the clinical status.
Animal preparation
Pigs were anesthetized using ketamine (20 mg/kg i.m.),
acepromazine (0.25 mg/kg i.m.) and pentobarbital
(10 mg/kg/h i.v.). They were intubated and mechanically
ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator (Alpha Vet,
Minerve, France; FiO2 = 30%). Respiratory rate and tidal
volume were set at 17 cycles/min and ≈ 330-350 ml/cycle,
respectively. Left carotid artery and left external jugular
vein catheters were inserted for blood pressure 
measurement and sampling and drug administration, respectively.
End-tidal CO2 concentration in the expired air (EtCO2)
and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were continuously
monitored (Mindray PM-8000 Vet, Hamburg, Germany).
We also recorded electrocardiogram as well as rectal and
esophageal temperatures and measured arterial blood pH,
O2 and CO2 partial pressures (PaO2 and PaCO2, 
respect-ively). After surgery, animals received antibiotics (amoxi-
cillin; 15 mg/kg s.c.) and analgesia (meloxicam; 0.4 mg/kg/
day i.m.). Throughout experiments, hemodynamic data
were digitalized and analyzed using the data acquisition
software HEM v3.5 (Notocord, Croissy-sur-Seine, France).
Experimental protocol
After surgical preparation and stabilisation, pigs were
randomly divided into 4 groups. In the Control group,
animals were submitted to 12 h of mechanical 
ventilation and subsequent weaning and awakening without
any other treatment. In the other groups, animals 
received a static intratracheal administration of 15 ml/kg
of PFD (C10F18; F2Chemicals®, Preston, Lancashire, UK)
or PFOC (C8F18; F2-Chemicals®, Preston, Lancashire, UK)
or PFOB (C8F17Br, OriGen®, Helsingborg, Sweden). These
PFC were infused using a catheter into the endotracheal
tube without interrupting mechanical ventilation. The

volume of 15 ml/kg was chosen as the average volume
used in clinical trials with partial liquid ventilation [14]. In
order to facilitate perfluorocarbon spreading within the
lungs, the filling was separated in 3 consecutive 
administrations of 5 ml/kg while the animal was placed in the
right, supine and left positions, respectively. Prior to any
administration, PFC were bubbled with 100% O2 for
5 min. In all groups, animals were mechanically ventilated
during 12 h under anaesthesia before subsequent weaning
and awakening. Ventilatory parameters were maintained
as previously described (FiO2 = 30%; Respiratory rate and
tidal volume = 17 cycles/min and ≈ 330-350 ml/cycle, 
re-spectively). Animals then returned to their cages for a daily
follow-up during a total duration of 96 h after PFC 
administration. Hemodynamic parameters and blood gases were
assessed under anaesthesia throughout the initial 
procedure, as well as at t = 48 h and 96 h in awake animals.
After the last recording (at t = 96 h), animals were 
eutha-nized by an overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg i.v.) for
organ sampling.
Pathology and histology
After euthanasia, a complete autopsy of each animal was
performed. All analyses were systematically blinded for
group allocation. Lungs were removed, photographed and
each lobe was sampled for subsequent analyses. Samples
were fixed by formaldehyde and stored for the assessment
of residual PFC contents, as described in the next section
(one section for each lobe = 6 sections for each pig). They
were subsequently prepared for histological analyses using
haematoxylin-eosin-saffron staining. Beyond the 
description of any pathological appearance, the pathologist 
attributed a 0 to 10 semi-quantitative score to the most
common lesions observed in these samples, i.e., abnormal
alveolar wall thickening and alveolar infiltration with foam
macrophages (0 = normal, 10 = very severe lesion). A score
was attributed for each lobe and a mean lung score was
then calculated for each animal.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
In order to assess the amount of residual PFC within the
lung, formaldehyde-fixed samples were studied using
fluorine MRI with a 1.5 T system equipped with the 
multi-nuclei option (Achieva, Philips, Best, The Netherlands).
Dedicated transmit-receive radiofrequency switch and
pre-amplifier tuned to 19 F frequency were designed. A
two-port dual-resonant volume coil comprising a 10-cm
diameter Helmholtz coil (19 F) and a 10-cm long saddle
coil (1H) were built and connected to transmit-receive
switches. For each pig, the seven lobe samples were 
imaged at the same time and 3 samples of pure PFD, PFOC
and PFOB were added in the field-of-view of the coil for
signal calibration and quantification. For parenchyma 
imaging, a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence with 1 mm
Page 3 of 9
isotropic resolution, TR/TE = 8.1/3.7 ms, 
bandwidth-per-pixel 191 Hz, matrix size 164×72×72, was applied to
obtain T1-weigthed (flip angle 20°, 1 average) and 
proton density (flip angle 5°, 8 averages) scans. To evaluate
PFC, fluorine images were acquired using a 3D spoiled
gradient echo sequence with isotropic 1.5 mm resolution,
TR/TE = 12/2.9 ms, bandwidth-per-pixel 2.2 kHz, matrix
size 116×52×52, flip angle 10° and 16 averages. Bandwidth
and echo time were chosen such that chemical shift
artifact was minimized and that the various peaks of the
complex spectra were approximately in phase for all
PFC used.
Each sample was segmented in 3D by manually tracing
regions-of-interest (ROI) using the T1W and proton
density images. The ROI were used to evaluate the lung
sample volumes and were reported onto the fluorine 
images for PFC quantification. ROI were traced over the
tubes containing pure PFCs in the 19 F images and the
mean signal was calculated. Noise was measured as the
standard deviation in a region void of signal. Fluorine
images were thresholded at 3 times the noise level and
converted to concentration using the adequate reference
PFC signal from the tubes. The mean concentration
within each sample was then estimated.
Statistical analysis
Parametric data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Non
parametric data were expressed as median and individual
values. Hemodynamic parameters, temperature and blood
pH and gases partial pressure were considered as 
parametric data. They were compared between groups throughout
the protocol using a two-way analysis of variance for 
repeated measures. In order to avoid multiple comparisons,
post-hoc analyses were only made between groups but not
among different time-points. Accordingly, when the global
analysis did not show a significant group effect or an 
interaction between time and groups, we did not perform 
post-hoc analysis. When a group effect was significant, we
always had a significant interaction between time and
groups. Therefore, we performed post-hoc analysis at each
time-point between groups, but not between the different
time-points in a single group. Histological scores and lung
concentrations of PFC assessed by MRI were considered
as non parametric data. They were compared between
groups using a non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis analysis.
The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

Abstract
Background: The respiratory properties of perfluorocarbons (PFC) have been widely studied for liquid ventilation in
humans and animals. Several PFC were tested but their tolerance may depend on the species. Here, the effects of a
single administration of liquid PFC into pig lungs were assessed and compared. Three different PFC having distinct
evaporative and spreading coefficient properties were evaluated (Perfluorooctyl bromide [PFOB], perfluorodecalin
[PFD] and perfluoro-N-octane [PFOC]).
Methods: Pigs were anesthetized and submitted to mechanical ventilation. They randomly received an intra-tracheal
administration of 15 ml/kg of either PFOB, PFD or PFOC with 12 h of mechanical ventilation before awakening and
weaning from ventilation. A Control group was submitted to mechanical ventilation with no PFC administration. All
animals were followed during 4 days after the initial PFC administration to investigate gas exchanges and clinical
recovery. They were ultimately euthanized for histological analyses and assessment of PFC residual concentrations
within the lungs using dual nuclei fluorine and hydrogen Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Sixteen animals were
included (4/group).
Results: In the PFD group, animals tended to be hypoxemic after awakening. In PFOB and PFOC groups, blood gases
were not significantly different from the Control group after awakening. The poor tolerance of PFD was likely related to
a large amount of residual PFC, as observed using MRI in all lung samples (≈10% of lung volume). This percentage was
lower in the PFOB group (≈1%) but remained significantly greater than in the Control group. In the PFOC group, the
percentage of residual PFC was not significantly different from that of the Control group (≈0.1%). Histologically, the
most striking feature was an alveolar infiltration with foam macrophages, especially in the groups treated by PFD or
PFOB.
Conclusions: Of the three tested perfluorocarbons, PFOC offered the best tolerance in terms of lung function, gas
exchanges and residuum in the lung. PFOC was rapidly cleared from the lungs and virtually disappeared after 4 days
whereas PFOB persisted at significant levels and led to foam macrophage infiltration. PFOC could be relevant for short
term total liquid ventilation with a rapid weaning.

Background
Liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons (PFC) has been
proposed to improve gas exchanges and lung compliance
in adults [1,2] and infants [3] with acute respiratory 
distress. Chemically, these liquids are fluorinated organic
compounds with high density, low surface tension and
great solubility for oxygen and carbon dioxide [4] as 
compared to blood or water. During “total liquid ventilation”,
lungs are filled with liquid PFC and ventilated with liquid
tidal volumes [5]. This requires specific ventilators not yet
tested in humans. An easier approach has been formerly
tested using “partial liquid ventilation” in which lungs
were partially filled with PFC (approximately up to the
functional residual capacity) and conventionally ventilated
with gas ventilation [5].
In animals, different PFC have been tested for partial
and/or total liquid ventilation, including Rimar 101 [6-8],
FC-77 [9], perfluorodecalin (PFD) [3,10] or perfluorooctyl
bromide (PFOB), which was the most widely investigated
[2,10-13]. In humans, PFOB was investigated for its 
excellent spreading properties and low vapor pressure allowing
homogenous pulmonary repartition and low replacement
rate for prolonged episodes of partial liquid ventilation.
Despite promising preliminary results [2,12], this was not
shown to improve outcome after acute respiratory distress
syndrome in adults [14].
Another possible application for total liquid ventilation
with PFC is ultra-fast induction of hypothermia [8,15-18].
In this application, PFC are used as cooling liquids and
the lung as a thermal exchanger. This technique requires
dedicated liquid ventilators [8,19-21] and can induce
ultra-fast cooling and potent cardiac and neurological 
protection after cardiac arrest in animals [8,9,15-17,21,22]. In
this indication, total liquid ventilation is expected to be
very short and used only for induction of hypothermia
(<30 min). The protective effects of hypothermic liquid
ventilation have been extensively shown in rabbits
[8,15,22] but need now to be confirmed in pigs. These
species are indeed considered as a gold-standard for all
confirmation studies in the field of cardiac arrest. 
However, pigs were shown to be very sensitive to some PFC as
macrophages infiltration could compromise lung recovery
after liquid ventilation with FC-77 [9]. Our present goal
was to investigate the tolerance in pigs of several other
PFC approved for a medical use in humans.
Accordingly, the effect of several PFC, including 
liquids with distinct evaporative and spreading coefficient
properties (PFOB, PFD and perfluoro-N-octane [PFOC]),
were properly assessed in pigs. To evaluate the intrinsic
effect of these PFC, they were infused in a single and
static administration within the lungs, with no further
total liquid ventilation or hypothermia. We choose this
design for two reasons: 1) it resembles to the weaning
phase that follows liquid ventilation, without any other
Page 2 of 9
confounding factor related to the putative effects induced
by liquid ventilation; 2) data suggests that this transition
phase where liquid coexist with gas ventilation, exposes
the most lungs to possible injury. Lung recovery was
assessed by gas exchanges and histological appearance
after 4 days of follow-up. Importantly, residual PFC 
distribution within the lungs was also assessed using an original
clinically-relevant tool with fluorine magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) technique [23-25].

follow-up during a total duration of 96 h after PFC 
administration. Hemodynamic parameters and blood gases were
assessed under anaesthesia throughout the initial 
procedure, as well as at t = 48 h and 96 h in awake animals.
After the last recording (at t = 96 h), animals were 
euthanized by an overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg i.v.) for
organ sampling.
Pathology and histology
After euthanasia, a complete autopsy of each animal was
performed. All analyses were systematically blinded for
group allocation. Lungs were removed, photographed and
each lobe was sampled for subsequent analyses. Samples
were fixed by formaldehyde and stored for the assessment
of residual PFC contents, as described in the next section
(one section for each lobe = 6 sections for each pig). They
were subsequently prepared for histological analyses using
haematoxylin-eosin-saffron staining. Beyond the 
description of any pathological appearance, the pathologist 
attributed a 0 to 10 semi-quantitative score to the most
common lesions observed in these samples, i.e., abnormal
alveolar wall thickening and alveolar infiltration with foam
macrophages (0 = normal, 10 = very severe lesion). A score
was attributed for each lobe and a mean lung score was
then calculated for each animal.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
In order to assess the amount of residual PFC within the
lung, formaldehyde-fixed samples were studied using
fluorine MRI with a 1.5 T system equipped with the 
multi-nuclei option (Achieva, Philips, Best, The Netherlands).
Dedicated transmit-receive radiofrequency switch and
pre-amplifier tuned to 19 F frequency were designed. A
two-port dual-resonant volume coil comprising a 10-cm
diameter Helmholtz coil (19 F) and a 10-cm long saddle
coil (1H) were built and connected to transmit-receive
switches. For each pig, the seven lobe samples were 
imaged at the same time and 3 samples of pure PFD, PFOC
and PFOB were added in the field-of-view of the coil for
signal calibration and quantification. For parenchyma 
imaging, a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence with 1 mm
Page 3 of 9
isotropic resolution, TR/TE = 8.1/3.7 ms, 
bandwidth-per-pixel 191 Hz, matrix size 164×72×72, was applied to
obtain T1-weigthed (flip angle 20°, 1 average) and 
proton density (flip angle 5°, 8 averages) scans. To evaluate
PFC, fluorine images were acquired using a 3D spoiled
gradient echo sequence with isotropic 1.5 mm resolution,
TR/TE = 12/2.9 ms, bandwidth-per-pixel 2.2 kHz, matrix
size 116×52×52, flip angle 10° and 16 averages. Bandwidth
and echo time were chosen such that chemical shift
artifact was minimized and that the various peaks of the
complex spectra were approximately in phase for all
PFC used.
Each sample was segmented in 3D by manually tracing
regions-of-interest (ROI) using the T1W and proton
density images. The ROI were used to evaluate the lung
sample volumes and were reported onto the fluorine 
images for PFC quantification. ROI were traced over the
tubes containing pure PFCs in the 19 F images and the
mean signal was calculated. Noise was measured as the
standard deviation in a region void of signal. Fluorine
images were thresholded at 3 times the noise level and
converted to concentration using the adequate reference
PFC signal from the tubes. The mean concentration
within each sample was then estimated.
Statistical analysis
Parametric data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Non
parametric data were expressed as median and individual
values. Hemodynamic parameters, temperature and blood
pH and gases partial pressure were considered as 
parametric data. They were compared between groups throughout
the protocol using a two-way analysis of variance for 
repeated measures. In order to avoid multiple comparisons,
post-hoc analyses were only made between groups but not
among different time-points. Accordingly, when the global
analysis did not show a significant group effect or an 
interaction between time and groups, we did not perform 
post-hoc analysis. When a group effect was significant, we
always had a significant interaction between time and
groups. Therefore, we performed post-hoc analysis at each
time-point between groups, but not between the different
time-points in a single group. Histological scores and lung
concentrations of PFC assessed by MRI were considered
as non parametric data. They were compared between
groups using a non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis analysis.
The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Number of animals, hemodynamic and respiratory
parameters
Sixteen animals were included in the present study, i.e.,
4 pigs in each group. They all completed the protocol,
except one animal which experienced severe respiratory
failure after awakening in the PFD group. This pig was

prematurely euthanized at 24 h for ethical reasons and
its lung samples were analyzed using the same 
procedures than those used for other animals (fluorine MRI
and histology). As shown in Table 1, heart rate, mean 
arterial pressure, rectal and esophageal temperatures were
not different among groups throughout the follow-up.
At baseline, the animals had similar blood pH and 
partial pressure for O2 and CO2 (Table 2). Ventilator 
parameters were similar among groups (minute volume =
0.30 ± 0.03, 0.26 ± 0.03, 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.31 ± 0.01 ml/
min/kg in the Control, PFD, PFOC and PFOB groups,
respectively). After PFC administration (t = 1 h), a 
transient decrease in PaO2 and PaC02 were observed in the
PFD, perfluorodecalin; PFOC, perfluoro-N-octane; PFOB, perfluorooctylbromide; *, One animal was euthanized for respiratory distress at t = 24 h in the PFD group.

PFOB and PFOC groups as compared to Control. At
t = 12 h, PaO2 values were significantly decreased in the
PFD group as compared to Control and PFOC groups.
One animal of the PFD group was even more hypoxemic
after awakening (at t = 24 h, PaO2 and PaCO2 = 22 and
60 mmHg, respectively). As mentioned above, this 
animal was euthanized for ethical reasons before 
completing the protocol. The surviving animals in the PFD
group also elicited abnormal blood gases with a 
significant increase in PaCO2 at t = 96 h. In the PFOB and
PFOC groups, blood gases after awakening and 
subsequent follow-up were not significantly altered as 
compared to the Control group (t = 48 and 96 h).

Assessment of lung residual PFC with MRI
Figure 1A illustrates typical images of fluorine MRI in an
animal of each group. An image for each lung lobe is 
provided, which corresponds to a central slice within each
sample. As expected, no signal was detected in the control
animal and only noise can be seen. The samples from the
PFD group are easily identified (arrows) with a large 
quantity of signal in almost every lobe. The samples from the
PFOB group has detectable amount of signal in several
lobes. The PFO group samples only displayed limited PFC
traces. MRI data post-processing provided the mean 
concentration of each PFC within each lung sample. As 
illustrated in Figure 1B, the amount of residual PFC was very
high in all samples from the PFD group, averaging ~10%
of lung volume. This percentage was lower in the PFOB
group (~1%) but remained significant as compared to
Control values. In the PFOC group, the percentage of 
residual PFC was not significant when compared to the
Control group (~0.1%, i.e., on the order of the noise level
observed in Control samples).
Lung histology
Macroscopic examinations of the lungs revealed an 
apparent overdistension in the groups treated with PFC as 
compared to the Control group (Figure 2). This observation
was not quantified but appeared to be dramatic in the
PFD group and only very mild in the PFOB and PFOC
groups. The blind analyses of histological slices further
revealed alveolar wall thickening in several samples, 
probably as a consequence of the mechanical ventilation 
episode. This alteration was not related to PFC treatment as
it was also often observed in the Control group. As an 
example, Figures 3A and B illustrate the normal appearance
of the lung in a sample from the PFOC group as 
compared to a mild alveolar wall thickening showing some
hypercellularity but no fibrosis in the PFOB group. 
However, these lesions were mild in most samples. The most
striking feature was rather an alveolar infiltration with
foam macrophages as illustrated in samples from the PFD
and PFOB groups in Figures 3C, D and E (arrows). In a
few samples, foam macrophages were even identified in
bronchioles (e.g., Figure 3F from the PFOB group). In
order to compare the severity of macrophage infiltration
among groups, a semi-quantitative score was blindly 
attributed to each animal using the mean value of the 
different lobes. As illustrated in Figure 4, foam macrophage
infiltration was only observed in the groups treated by
PFC but not in the Control group. It was more 
pronounced in the PFD and PFOB groups as compared to the
PFOC group.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that static administration of
PFOB or PFOC did not compromise gas exchanges after
rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation whereas
PFD was poorly tolerated and led to severe hypoxemia
in pigs. In order to link lung recovery and PFC residues,
we assessed simultaneously lung histology and PFC
concentrations using fluorine MRI on lung samples.
This imaging tool is highly specific and can be used with
all PFC. The poor tolerance of PFD in the present study
was probably related to the large amount of residual
PFC while PFOB was present at only low levels within
the lungs. In comparison, PFOC was virtually 
eliminated from the lungs after 12 h of mechanical 
ventilation and 4 days of recovery. This is in agreement with a
previous report in humans experiencing liquid 
ventilation with PFOB and showing residual detectable PFC
levels at radiography during at least 4 days after the last
administration [26].
The rapid elimination of PFOC can be explained by its
high vapour pressure and evaporative properties as 
compared to PFOB and PFD (vapour pressure ≈ 50 vs 10.4 and
13.6 mmHg at 37°C, respectively) [27,28]. Conversely, 
differences in vapour pressures do not explain the amount of
residual PFC in the PFD group as compared to PFOB. As
described by Faithfull et al. [29], PFC distribution actually
depends on the interface between PFC and both gas and
aqueous phases during liquid ventilation. Depending on the
surface tensions between PFC and both air and water, a
PFC could either become “wettable” and widely distributed
or conversely form droplet and be poorly distributed.
Faithfull et al. [29] calculated the spreading coefficient of
several PFC and demonstrated that positive values (good
“wettibility”) can be obtained with PFOB (+2.7 dyn/cm
at 25°C) whereas negative values were obtained with
PFD (−1.5 dyn/cm at 25°C). Using the surface tensions
calculated by Meinert and Roy for PFOC, we also 
estimated the spreading coefficient of PFOC to +3.0 dyn/
cm at 25°C [30]. It means that PFOB and PFOC can be
distributed homogenously at the interface between air
and water while PFD tends to form droplets. The more
homogeneous distribution of PFOB was confirmed by
tomography in rabbits as compared to PFD [13]. These
phenomenona can also explain air trapping and 
formation of menisci of PFD within lung airways. This could
be linked to the severe hypoxia and apparent lung 
overdistension observed in the present study in the PFD group.
Such overdistension can also be induced or worsened by
the mechanical ventilation after PFC administration. 
Indeed, one can argue that our protocol used constant tidal
volumes during mechanical ventilation even after PFC
administration, as previously done in most trials with 
partial liquid ventilation. Ricard et al. showed that such a
strategy combined with high doses of PFOB can worsen
Page 6 of 9

ventilation-induced lung injury of healthy [31] or 
prein-jured lungs [32], respectively. This may provide some 
explanation for the negative results of the large-scale clinical
trial conducted with partial liquid ventilation in adults
with acute respiratory distress syndrome [14]. It might be
more relevant to temporally decrease tidal volumes after
PFC administration in order to prevent putative trauma

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/53
inducing secondary distension, until sufficient evaporation
of the PFC.
The results regarding PFC residual concentrations were
corroborated by histological analyses. Indeed we observed
numerous foam macrophages within alveoli and/or 
airways in PFOB and PFD groups, probably as a result of
PFC clearance. In accordance with the low concentrations
of PFC residues in the PFOC group, we observed only few
foam macrophages in this group. Indeed, such histological
appearance was likely expected as macrophages are well
known to form vacuoles and become foamy in the 
presence of PFC [33,34]. Lung foam macrophages were 
observed in previous reports, e.g., in rabbits submitted to
total liquid ventilation with PFD [22] or after intravenous
administration of PFC through secondary lung elimination
[34]. It was also proposed that pigs could be highly 
sensitive to PFC-induced macrophage activation through a high
concentration of alveolar resident macrophages in 
comparison to other species. As an example, total liquid 
ventilation with PFD was much better tolerated in rabbits
[10,13,22] and lambs [3]. The present study suggests,
however, that even in pigs, specific PFCs may be well
tolerated, while others will be toxic. Pigs could therefore
be an appropriate species for safety experiments with
PFC but for studies of treatment effects (e.g., 
resuscitation studies), it will depend on the specific PFC used.
From these observations, it is also clear that PFOC
could be well tolerated and rapidly eliminated when a
very rapid weaning/awakening is expected after PFC 
administration, while PFOB might be more relevant for
longer term mechanical ventilation. As a limitation of
our study, we should however emphasize that we only
followed animals during a short period (4 days). 
Previous trials investigated this aspect in other conditions,
e.g., with perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion [35].
Finally, our study also showed the importance of 
fluorine MRI for PFC imaging. This technique offers promising
perspectives for general lung imaging using fluorinated
gases or liquids [25], and especially for clinical testing with
liquid ventilation. As previously demonstrated [36,37], this
is a highly specific technique that could be a useful 
additional tool before taking any decision of patient weaning
of ventilation support.
Conclusions
In conclusion, intrapulmonary administration of PFOB
and PFOC appeared to be well tolerated regarding 
respiratory function and gas exchanges after awakening in
pigs. PFOC was rapidly cleared from the lung and 
virtually disappeared after 4 days whereas PFOB persisted at
significant levels and led to foam macrophage 
infiltration. PFOC could be relevant in the setting of 
intrapulmonary administration for short durations, e.g., for total
liquid ventilation induced-cooling. In comparison, PFD

was poorly tolerated and compromised gas exchange,
probably as a consequence of large PFC residues.

Abstract
Background: The respiratory properties of perfluorocarbons (PFC) have been widely studied for liquid ventilation in
humans and animals. Several PFC were tested but their tolerance may depend on the species. Here, the effects of a
single administration of liquid PFC into pig lungs were assessed and compared. Three different PFC having distinct
evaporative and spreading coefficient properties were evaluated (Perfluorooctyl bromide [PFOB], perfluorodecalin
[PFD] and perfluoro-N-octane [PFOC]).
Methods: Pigs were anesthetized and submitted to mechanical ventilation. They randomly received an intra-tracheal
administration of 15 ml/kg of either PFOB, PFD or PFOC with 12 h of mechanical ventilation before awakening and
weaning from ventilation. A Control group was submitted to mechanical ventilation with no PFC administration. All
animals were followed during 4 days after the initial PFC administration to investigate gas exchanges and clinical
recovery. They were ultimately euthanized for histological analyses and assessment of PFC residual concentrations
within the lungs using dual nuclei fluorine and hydrogen Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Sixteen animals were
included (4/group).
Results: In the PFD group, animals tended to be hypoxemic after awakening. In PFOB and PFOC groups, blood gases
were not significantly different from the Control group after awakening. The poor tolerance of PFD was likely related to
a large amount of residual PFC, as observed using MRI in all lung samples (≈10% of lung volume). This percentage was
lower in the PFOB group (≈1%) but remained significantly greater than in the Control group. In the PFOC group, the
percentage of residual PFC was not significantly different from that of the Control group (≈0.1%). Histologically, the
most striking feature was an alveolar infiltration with foam macrophages, especially in the groups treated by PFD or
PFOB.
Conclusions: Of the three tested perfluorocarbons, PFOC offered the best tolerance in terms of lung function, gas
exchanges and residuum in the lung. PFOC was rapidly cleared from the lungs and virtually disappeared after 4 days
whereas PFOB persisted at significant levels and led to foam macrophage infiltration. PFOC could be relevant for short
term total liquid ventilation with a rapid weaning.

Background
Liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons (PFC) has been
proposed to improve gas exchanges and lung compliance
in adults [1,2] and infants [3] with acute respiratory 
distress. Chemically, these liquids are fluorinated organic
compounds with high density, low surface tension and
great solubility for oxygen and carbon dioxide [4] as 
compared to blood or water. During “total liquid ventilation”,
lungs are filled with liquid PFC and ventilated with liquid
tidal volumes [5]. This requires specific ventilators not yet
tested in humans. An easier approach has been formerly
tested using “partial liquid ventilation” in which lungs
were partially filled with PFC (approximately up to the
functional residual capacity) and conventionally ventilated
with gas ventilation [5].
In animals, different PFC have been tested for partial
and/or total liquid ventilation, including Rimar 101 [6-8],
FC-77 [9], perfluorodecalin (PFD) [3,10] or perfluorooctyl
bromide (PFOB), which was the most widely investigated
[2,10-13]. In humans, PFOB was investigated for its 
excellent spreading properties and low vapor pressure allowing
homogenous pulmonary repartition and low replacement
rate for prolonged episodes of partial liquid ventilation.
Despite promising preliminary results [2,12], this was not
shown to improve outcome after acute respiratory distress
syndrome in adults [14].
Another possible application for total liquid ventilation
with PFC is ultra-fast induction of hypothermia [8,15-18].
In this application, PFC are used as cooling liquids and
the lung as a thermal exchanger. This technique requires
dedicated liquid ventilators [8,19-21] and can induce
ultra-fast cooling and potent cardiac and neurological 
protection after cardiac arrest in animals [8,9,15-17,21,22]. In
this indication, total liquid ventilation is expected to be
very short and used only for induction of hypothermia
(<30 min). The protective effects of hypothermic liquid
ventilation have been extensively shown in rabbits
[8,15,22] but need now to be confirmed in pigs. These
species are indeed considered as a gold-standard for all
confirmation studies in the field of cardiac arrest. 
However, pigs were shown to be very sensitive to some PFC as
macrophages infiltration could compromise lung recovery
after liquid ventilation with FC-77 [9]. Our present goal
was to investigate the tolerance in pigs of several other
PFC approved for a medical use in humans.
Accordingly, the effect of several PFC, including 
liquids with distinct evaporative and spreading coefficient
properties (PFOB, PFD and perfluoro-N-octane [PFOC]),
were properly assessed in pigs. To evaluate the intrinsic
effect of these PFC, they were infused in a single and
static administration within the lungs, with no further
total liquid ventilation or hypothermia. We choose this
design for two reasons: 1) it resembles to the weaning
phase that follows liquid ventilation, without any other
Page 2 of 9
confounding factor related to the putative effects induced
by liquid ventilation; 2) data suggests that this transition
phase where liquid coexist with gas ventilation, exposes
the most lungs to possible injury. Lung recovery was
assessed by gas exchanges and histological appearance
after 4 days of follow-up. Importantly, residual PFC 
distribution within the lungs was also assessed using an original
clinically-relevant tool with fluorine magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) technique [23-25].

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
This study demonstrates that static administration of
PFOB or PFOC did not compromise gas exchanges after
rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation whereas
PFD was poorly tolerated and led to severe hypoxemia
in pigs. In order to link lung recovery and PFC residues,
we assessed simultaneously lung histology and PFC
concentrations using fluorine MRI on lung samples.
This imaging tool is highly specific and can be used with
all PFC. The poor tolerance of PFD in the present study
was probably related to the large amount of residual
PFC while PFOB was present at only low levels within
the lungs. In comparison, PFOC was virtually 
eliminated from the lungs after 12 h of mechanical 
ventilation and 4 days of recovery. This is in agreement with a
previous report in humans experiencing liquid 
ventilation with PFOB and showing residual detectable PFC
levels at radiography during at least 4 days after the last
administration [26].
The rapid elimination of PFOC can be explained by its
high vapour pressure and evaporative properties as 
compared to PFOB and PFD (vapour pressure ≈ 50 vs 10.4 and
13.6 mmHg at 37°C, respectively) [27,28]. Conversely, 
differences in vapour pressures do not explain the amount of
residual PFC in the PFD group as compared to PFOB. As
described by Faithfull et al. [29], PFC distribution actually
depends on the interface between PFC and both gas and
aqueous phases during liquid ventilation. Depending on the
surface tensions between PFC and both air and water, a
PFC could either become “wettable” and widely distributed
or conversely form droplet and be poorly distributed.
Faithfull et al. [29] calculated the spreading coefficient of
several PFC and demonstrated that positive values (good
“wettibility”) can be obtained with PFOB (+2.7 dyn/cm
at 25°C) whereas negative values were obtained with
PFD (−1.5 dyn/cm at 25°C). Using the surface tensions
calculated by Meinert and Roy for PFOC, we also 
estimated the spreading coefficient of PFOC to +3.0 dyn/
cm at 25°C [30]. It means that PFOB and PFOC can be
distributed homogenously at the interface between air
and water while PFD tends to form droplets. The more
homogeneous distribution of PFOB was confirmed by
tomography in rabbits as compared to PFD [13]. These
phenomenona can also explain air trapping and 
formation of menisci of PFD within lung airways. This could
be linked to the severe hypoxia and apparent lung 
overdistension observed in the present study in the PFD group.
Such overdistension can also be induced or worsened by
the mechanical ventilation after PFC administration. 
Indeed, one can argue that our protocol used constant tidal
volumes during mechanical ventilation even after PFC
administration, as previously done in most trials with 
partial liquid ventilation. Ricard et al. showed that such a
strategy combined with high doses of PFOB can worsen

ventilation-induced lung injury of healthy [31] or 
prein-jured lungs [32], respectively. This may provide some 
explanation for the negative results of the large-scale clinical
trial conducted with partial liquid ventilation in adults
with acute respiratory distress syndrome [14]. It might be
more relevant to temporally decrease tidal volumes after
PFC administration in order to prevent putative trauma

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/53
inducing secondary distension, until sufficient evaporation
of the PFC.
The results regarding PFC residual concentrations were
corroborated by histological analyses. Indeed we observed
numerous foam macrophages within alveoli and/or 
airways in PFOB and PFD groups, probably as a result of
PFC clearance. In accordance with the low concentrations
of PFC residues in the PFOC group, we observed only few
foam macrophages in this group. Indeed, such histological
appearance was likely expected as macrophages are well
known to form vacuoles and become foamy in the 
presence of PFC [33,34]. Lung foam macrophages were 
observed in previous reports, e.g., in rabbits submitted to
total liquid ventilation with PFD [22] or after intravenous
administration of PFC through secondary lung elimination
[34]. It was also proposed that pigs could be highly 
sensitive to PFC-induced macrophage activation through a high
concentration of alveolar resident macrophages in 
comparison to other species. As an example, total liquid 
ventilation with PFD was much better tolerated in rabbits
[10,13,22] and lambs [3]. The present study suggests,
however, that even in pigs, specific PFCs may be well
tolerated, while others will be toxic. Pigs could therefore
be an appropriate species for safety experiments with
PFC but for studies of treatment effects (e.g., 
resuscitation studies), it will depend on the specific PFC used.
From these observations, it is also clear that PFOC
could be well tolerated and rapidly eliminated when a
very rapid weaning/awakening is expected after PFC 
administration, while PFOB might be more relevant for
longer term mechanical ventilation. As a limitation of
our study, we should however emphasize that we only
followed animals during a short period (4 days). 
Previous trials investigated this aspect in other conditions,
e.g., with perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion [35].
Finally, our study also showed the importance of 
fluorine MRI for PFC imaging. This technique offers promising
perspectives for general lung imaging using fluorinated
gases or liquids [25], and especially for clinical testing with
liquid ventilation. As previously demonstrated [36,37], this
is a highly specific technique that could be a useful 
additional tool before taking any decision of patient weaning
of ventilation support.

Results
Number of animals, hemodynamic and respiratory
parameters
Sixteen animals were included in the present study, i.e.,
4 pigs in each group. They all completed the protocol,
except one animal which experienced severe respiratory
failure after awakening in the PFD group. This pig was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/53
prematurely euthanized at 24 h for ethical reasons and
its lung samples were analyzed using the same 
procedures than those used for other animals (fluorine MRI
and histology). As shown in Table 1, heart rate, mean 
arterial pressure, rectal and esophageal temperatures were
not different among groups throughout the follow-up.
At baseline, the animals had similar blood pH and 
partial pressure for O2 and CO2 (Table 2). Ventilator 
parameters were similar among groups (minute volume =
0.30 ± 0.03, 0.26 ± 0.03, 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.31 ± 0.01 ml/
min/kg in the Control, PFD, PFOC and PFOB groups,
respectively). After PFC administration (t = 1 h), a 
transient decrease in PaO2 and PaC02 were observed in the
PFD, perfluorodecalin; PFOC, perfluoro-N-octane; PFOB, perfluorooctylbromide; *, One animal was euthanized for respiratory distress at t = 24 h in the PFD group.

PFOB and PFOC groups as compared to Control. At
t = 12 h, PaO2 values were significantly decreased in the
PFD group as compared to Control and PFOC groups.
One animal of the PFD group was even more hypoxemic
after awakening (at t = 24 h, PaO2 and PaCO2 = 22 and
60 mmHg, respectively). As mentioned above, this 
animal was euthanized for ethical reasons before 
completing the protocol. The surviving animals in the PFD
group also elicited abnormal blood gases with a 
significant increase in PaCO2 at t = 96 h. In the PFOB and
PFOC groups, blood gases after awakening and 
subsequent follow-up were not significantly altered as 
compared to the Control group (t = 48 and 96 h).

Assessment of lung residual PFC with MRI
Figure 1A illustrates typical images of fluorine MRI in an
animal of each group. An image for each lung lobe is 
provided, which corresponds to a central slice within each
sample. As expected, no signal was detected in the control
animal and only noise can be seen. The samples from the
PFD group are easily identified (arrows) with a large 
quantity of signal in almost every lobe. The samples from the
PFOB group has detectable amount of signal in several
lobes. The PFO group samples only displayed limited PFC
traces. MRI data post-processing provided the mean 
concentration of each PFC within each lung sample. As 
illustrated in Figure 1B, the amount of residual PFC was very
high in all samples from the PFD group, averaging ~10%
of lung volume. This percentage was lower in the PFOB
group (~1%) but remained significant as compared to
Control values. In the PFOC group, the percentage of 
residual PFC was not significant when compared to the
Control group (~0.1%, i.e., on the order of the noise level
observed in Control samples).
Lung histology
Macroscopic examinations of the lungs revealed an 
apparent overdistension in the groups treated with PFC as 
compared to the Control group (Figure 2). This observation
was not quantified but appeared to be dramatic in the
PFD group and only very mild in the PFOB and PFOC
groups. The blind analyses of histological slices further
revealed alveolar wall thickening in several samples, 
probably as a consequence of the mechanical ventilation 
episode. This alteration was not related to PFC treatment as
it was also often observed in the Control group. As an 
example, Figures 3A and B illustrate the normal appearance
of the lung in a sample from the PFOC group as 
compared to a mild alveolar wall thickening showing some
hypercellularity but no fibrosis in the PFOB group. 
However, these lesions were mild in most samples. The most
striking feature was rather an alveolar infiltration with
foam macrophages as illustrated in samples from the PFD
and PFOB groups in Figures 3C, D and E (arrows). In a
few samples, foam macrophages were even identified in
bronchioles (e.g., Figure 3F from the PFOB group). In
order to compare the severity of macrophage infiltration
among groups, a semi-quantitative score was blindly 
attributed to each animal using the mean value of the 
different lobes. As illustrated in Figure 4, foam macrophage
infiltration was only observed in the groups treated by
PFC but not in the Control group. It was more 
pronounced in the PFD and PFOB groups as compared to the
PFOC group.
