Background: The fundamental cause of overweight and obesity is consumption of calorie-dense
foods. We have introduced a zero-calorie sweet sugar, d-psicose (d-allulose), a rare sugar that
has been proven to have strong antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects, and could
be used as a replacement of natural sugar for the obese and diabetic subjects.
Aim: Above mentioned efficacy of d-psicose (d-allulose) has been confirmed in our previous
studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty
(OLETF) rats with short-term treatment. In this study we investigated the long-term effect of
d-psicose in preventing the commencement and progression of T2DM with the mechanism of
preservation of pancreatic β-cells in OLETF rats.
Methods: Treated OLETF rats were fed 5% d-psicose dissolved in water and control rats only
water. Nondiabetic control rats, Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO), were taken as healthy
control and fed water. To follow the progression of diabetes, periodic measurements of blood
glucose, plasma insulin, and body weight changes were continued till sacrifice at 60 weeks.
Periodic in vivo body fat mass was measured. On sacrifice, pancreas, liver, and abdominal
adipose tissues were collected for various staining tests.
Results: d-Psicose prevented the commencement and progression of T2DM till 60 weeks
through the maintenance of blood glucose levels, decrease in body weight gain, and the control
of postprandial hyperglycemia, with decreased levels of HbA  in comparison to nontreated
1c
control rats. This improvement in glycemic control was accompanied by the maintenance of
plasma insulin levels and the preservation of pancreatic β-cells with the significant reduction in
inflammatory markers. Body fat accumulation was significantly lower in the treatment group,
with decreased infiltration of macrophages in the abdominal adipose tissue.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the rare sugar d-psicose could be beneficial for the
prevention and control of obesity and hyperglycemia with the preservation of β-cells in the
progression of T2DM.

Introduction
Overweight and obesity are not only the leading risk factors for global deaths but also
the major contributor to other serious diseases worldwide, including heart disease,
cancers, and type 2 diabetes. Mainly because of the uncontrolled intake of high-fat
and high-cholesterol diet, the prevalence of overweight and rate of obesity drastically
increase. Following this, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inevitably arises, which 
warrants attentive consideration of the vital role of food for prevention and treatment.

The inextricably interlinked overweight, obesity, and
T2DM, usually commencing from obesity, if not arrested,
might be associated with life-threatening consequences of
cardiac and metabolic diseases, high blood pressure, 
atherosclerosis, and T2DM.1 Moreover, chronic intake of high
calories forces the pancreatic β-cells to produce more insulin
in order to cope with body demands to maintain glucose
homeostasis, which, in turn, increases β-cell function and
mass.2 When the pancreas fails, insulin resistance becomes
decompensated and hyperglycemia is detected. Among the
leading mechanisms of insulin resistance, nonresolving
low-grade inflammation that involves a number of 
inflammatory cytokines,3 lipids and their metabolites, and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) have been mentioned.4 It is found
that macrophages accumulate in inflammation tissue and
discharge cytokines3 such as proinflammatory cytokines,
interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin (IL-1β), and tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Obesity itself is also closely related
to systemic adipose inflammation with aggregation of
macrophages, and high levels of those cytokines from them
aggravate altogether insulin resistance with the progression
of T2DM.4 Although regular exercise and low-calorie diet
could improve hyperglycemia and associated complications
related to T2DM, most patients need medication. Although
some antihyperglycemic products can improve the 
interrelated complications, they cause weight gain and, in turn, be
associated with high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. 
Pharmacological approaches such as sulfonylureas and metformin
have not been able to adequately improve the consequences
of insulin resistance so far.
Therefore, attention has been focused on the study of
herbal medicines that may not only provide better 
protection with lesser side effects but also ameliorate the 
associated comorbidities with the prevention of β-cell failure.5
Additionally, with the intense attention of researchers and
the growing interest of the general public concerning the
treatment and prevention of diseases, functional foods have
been explored.6 It has been shown that functional foods 
contribute to the improvement of overall health and reduce the
occurrence of diseases.7 Recently, in an attempt to produce
functional foods aimed at low calorie and less sugar intake,
various foods with d-psicose added as a substitute for sugar
have been prepared and marketed locally as FOSHU (Food
for Specific Health Use).
d-Psicose (d-allulose), one of the rare sugars, has been
proven to have antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic,
and anti-inflammatory effects. Owing to less 
availability, the biological functions of d-psicose have not been
Dovepress
sufficiently explored. However, the innovation of a unique
production method developed by Izumori8 enabled a number
of investigations. Studies have shown that d-psicose is 
effective experimentally against obesity and T2DM in normal9,10
and in T2DM rat models,11-13 and clinically in healthy14 and
borderline diabetic humans.15 Thus, these studies reflect the
commercial use of d-psicose as a sugar substitute against
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. The possible 
mechanisms of controlling high glucose levels, such as potency of
absorption of d-psicose over d-glucose from the intestine16
and inhibition of the activities of enzymes glucoamylase and
maltase, have been investigated.10 Our previous study showed
that d-psicose could play a role in the metabolic regulation in
T2DM OLETF (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty) rats
through maintaining blood glucose levels and preventing fat
accumulation in the abdomen.12 The possible mechanisms
to maintain hyperglycemia may be through the translocation
of glucokinase activity, which has been shown to be lower
in hyperglycemic or diabetic condition,17 as well as through
the protection of the pancreatic β-cells from injury caused
by hyperglycemia.13
d-Psicose has also been shown to inhibit hepatic fatty
acid synthase as the mechanism of fat control, followed by
decreased body weight gain, when compared to d-glucose.18
In addition to the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic
effects of d-psicose, its zero-calorie credit and 70% relative
sweetness9 also attracted some of the food companies to
produce various foodstuffs containing d-psicose. US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized d-psicose as
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and has permitted its
use as a food ingredient, with GRN Number 400.19
In our previous studies,12,13 we fed OLETF rats with
d-psicose for 3 months till the age of 20 weeks, around when
these rats usually develop mild hyperglycemia.20 However,
in this study we continued d-psicose feeding till the age of
60 weeks in order to study several issues such as whether
d-psicose could maintain prolonged sustained 
normoglyce-mia; protect β-cells against severe damage observed at this
stage; control the cytokines related to inflammation since
amelioration of oxidative stress and modulation of 
proinflammatory parameters have been shown to be beneficial
for T2DM patients.21
Materials and methods
animals, drugs, foods, and drinks
Both OLETF and LETO (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka) rats
were bought from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokushima,
Japan) at 4-week age and were allowed to adapt for 2 weeks.

The animals were maintained at 23°C±2°C and 55%±5%
humidity with 12-hour light/dark cycle. d-Psicose (d-allulose
or d-ribo-2-hexulose; molecular formula, C H O ; molecular
weight, 180.156) is a rare ketohexose, named “rare sugar,”
supplied by Kagawa University Rare Sugar Research Center
(Miki, Kagawa, Japan). Rats were fed MF rat chow (Orien-
tal Yeast Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan). d-Psicose was
dissolved in normal tap water, and the rats were allowed to
drink freely.
experimental protocol
Six-week-old OLETF rats were divided into 2 groups (n=10
each): OLETF psicose (O-P) and OLETF control (O-C).
Psicose group was given 5% d-psicose; O-C and LETO were
given water only. All rats were supplied MF food pellets and
their respective drinks. Body weight was measured every
week till 60 weeks. Food and drink intakes were measured
for three consecutive days each week and the average rat/
day intake was calculated. Periodic fasting and postprandial
blood glucose levels were measured using a freestyle 
glucose meter (YSI 2300-STAT) from tip of the tail. Plasma
was collected from the blood by centrifugation and was
stored at -80°C until analysis. At the end of 60 weeks, the
rats were fasted for 12 hours and then anaesthetized deeply.
Then, the abdomen was opened, blood was withdrawn, and
necessary organs were removed, weighed, and preserved
as per measurements and staining procedures. Abdominal
fat was collected from the epididymal, retroperitoneal, and
mesenteric spaces and weighed.
Tests and measurements
Rats were fasted 12 hours for oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), 0-minute sample was collected, and then each rat
was fed 2 g/kg body weight glucose by gavage and blood
was collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after gavage.
The frozen plasma was used to measure insulin and lipids
(total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TG], and high- and
low-density lipoproteins [HDL and LDL]). Serum levels
of glutathione (GSH), IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, and adiponectin
were measured using rat-specific enzyme-linked 
immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations.
For in vivo body composition measurement, bioimpedance
spectroscopy (ImpediVet, ImpediMed Ltd., Brisbane, QLD,
Australia) was used to estimate total fat mass (FM), fat-free
body mass, and body mass index (BMI).22
To evaluate insulin resistance severity, homeostasis
model assessment (HOMA) was calculated.23 The details
6 12 6
d-Psicose prevents diabetes development
of this calculation are mentioned in our previous study.13
To measure the inflammatory profile, the pancreas and 
adipose tissues were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Light microscopy
was used to evaluate adipocyte histology, and ImageJ (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA) software was used to count the 
pancreas islet number, but it was very difficult to identify clearly
because of the disorganized and broken status of the islets
of Langerhans. Hence, the islets were counted after insulin
immunostaining. However, the islet cell mass was calculated
by multiplying β-cell percentage by total pancreatic weight
and the percentage by insulin-positive staining. For 
immu-nostaining of insulin and glucagon, the pancreas tissue was
embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and
stained with respective antibodies (Funakoshi, Japan).
statistics
All values presented are the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Significant difference among the groups was determined by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences
between groups were analyzed by the post hoc test 
Hoech-berg’s for equal and Games-Howell for unequal variances by
using the SPSS software (version 17.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). A P-value of 0.05 was taken as significant.
Results
antihyperglycemic effect of d-psicose
Changes in blood glucose and serum insulin concentration:
Fasting blood glucose levels increased gradually in the
OLETF groups and were significantly higher all through the
experimental period as compared with those in nondiabetic
LETO group (Figure 1A). In the O-C group, the glucose
levels started to increase slowly from 25 weeks and then
sharply till 60 weeks, whereas in the O-P group the 
glucose levels started to increase slightly from 45 weeks and
remained constant till 60 weeks (Figure 1A). In contrast,
glucose levels in LETO group remained unchanged until 60
weeks. The rise of blood glucose levels between O-C and O-P
groups was significant from 35 weeks (P0.01) till sacrifice.
Periodic fasting serum insulin levels increased gradually
from week 10 in the O-C group, peaked at 30 weeks, and
decreased thereafter, even decreasing to almost zero level at
week 60 (Figure 1B). These increases from weeks 20 to 40
were significantly higher than those in both O-P and LETO
groups. In contrast, plasma insulin levels in both O-P and
LETO groups increased slightly from week 10 and then
remained almost unchanged until week 60. Glucose levels
from the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly higher

in the O-C group in all time points at every week than those
in the O-P group. And the levels in the LETO group were
significantly lower than in the O-C group at every week and
the O-P group at weeks 40 and 60 (Figure 1C-E). Initially,
at week 10 blood glucose levels returned close to base line
120 minutes after gavage in all groups, whereas the return
values in 120 minutes were much higher in both O-C and
O-P groups at week 40 and markedly higher in the O-C
group at week 60. At week 40, plasma insulin levels in the
O-C group were significantly higher than in O-P group in
all time points, including 0 minutes, whereas at week 60
the levels became significantly lower than those in the O-P
group (Figure 1F-H).
Both HOMA-IR and HOMA-β indexes were significantly
higher in the O-C group than in both O-P and LETO groups,
indicating the state of insulin resistance in O-C rats in which
β-cells attempted to cope with increased insulin demand. In
the O-P group the levels of HOMA-IR and HOMA-β were
decreased and HOMA-%S (insulin sensitivity) was 
consistently increased (Figure 1I-K).
Postprandial blood glucose levels elevated significantly
in the O-C group gradually at weeks 20 and 30 (P0.01) and
then markedly till week 60 (P0.001) than in both O-P and
LETO groups, whereas there was no difference between O-P
and LETO groups (Figure 1L). The levels of HbA  were 
sig-1c
nificantly higher in the O-C group than in both O-P and LETO
groups; however, the O-P group also showed a significantly
higher value than that in LETO group at week 60, which was
still significantly lower than that in O-C group (Figure 1M).
antiobesity effect of d-psicose
Body weight, and food and drink consumption: Although the
body weight of both the OLETF groups increased 
progressively with age, the body weight of all individual O-C rats
was higher than that of all individual O-P rats till 33 weeks
of age, and thereafter, 5 out of 9 (56%) O-C rats started to
show a decline in body weight but none (0%) in the O-P
group (Figure 2A, B). At 50 weeks, one more rat in the O-C
group showed a decline in body weight (Figure 2A) and
the rest of the 3 rats continued to gain body weight slowly
till 55 weeks and finally started to decline till 60 weeks. In
contrast, with long-term d-psicose treatment, the O-P rats
continued to gain body weight spontaneously with age like
healthy rats till 60 weeks (Figure 2B). However, the average
weight gain in the O-P group was significantly lower than
that in the O-C group (Figure 2C).
d-Psicose decreased food intake, with the average daily
intake of the O-C, O-P, and LETO groups being 33.90±8.40,
26.11±7.02, and 22.63±0.34 g/rat/d, respectively (Figure 2D).
Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2015:9
d-Psicose prevents diabetes development
Drink consumption was also significantly lower in the O-P
group than in the O-C group from week 35 (Figure 2E).
Plasma lipids, body composition, and FM: Fasting plasma
concentration of TC in OLETF groups increased significantly
from week 30 than that in the LETO group, and among the
OLETF groups, TC level was significantly lower in the O-P
group than in the O-C group at 50 and 60 weeks (Figure 3A).
There was no significant difference in TG levels except at
week 60 (Figure 3B). Percent FM was lower in the O-P
group than in the O-C group, significantly at week 30 and
nonsignificantly at week 60 (Figure 3C). However, FM
was significantly lower with corresponding high fat-free
body mass in LETO than in OLETF rats. Body mass index
was significantly higher in the O-C group than in both O-P
and LETO groups (Figure 3D). Plasma lipoproteins were
significantly higher in OLETF groups than in LETO from
30 weeks onward, and significantly higher levels of HDL
at weeks 40 and 60 and LDL at weeks 50 and 60 in the
O-C than in the O-P (Figure 3E and F) were observed. The
amount of fat deposits (mesenteric + epididymal + 
retro-peritoneal) (Figure 3G) and the number of large adipocytes
(Figure 3H) were significantly lower in the O-P group than
in the O-C group, whereas the total number of adipocytes in
the O-P group was significantly higher than that in the O-C
group (Figure 3I). Representative H&E-stained 
photomicrographs of adipocytes are presented as O-C (Figure 3J), O-P
(Figure 3K), and LETO (Figure 3L).
Anti-inflammatory and β-cell-preserving
effects of d-psicose
In light microscopic findings, O-C rats showed striking
hyperplastic changes in the islets of Langerhans with 
extensive fibrosis. Most of the islets were disorganized, fibrotic,
separated into small clusters, resulting in multinodular
islets which were separated by connective tissue bands. As
a result, the number of islet cells was decreased (Figure 4,
adjacent table). Fatty degeneration was pronounced in the
hypertrophied islets. These histological alterations were
prominent and severe in the O-C group (Figure 4A) in 
comparison to the O-P group (Figure 4B). In the O-C group,
large or medium-size islets were hardly observed, while
many were seen in both the O-P and the LETO groups.
In the LETO group, these histological changes were not
observed, except for some fatty degeneration (Figure 4C).
To elucidate the islet architecture, better immunofluorescence
studies using anti-insulin and antiglucagon antibodies were
performed. The pattern of β-cells in the islets of LETO
rats was normal, with β-cells (red color) located centrally
and α-cells (green color) at the periphery (Figure 4F).

However, the distribution was changed to a mixed pattern at
week 60 in the O-C group (Figure 4D), where many of the
insulin-positive cells lost their normal structure and were seen
as a mixture of single or group of cells distributed all over the
pancreas. This scattered distribution was rarely observed in
the O-P group (Figure 4E) and not at all in the LETO group.
The replacement of insulin-containing granules in β-cells by
fat droplets and the distorted or diminished boundary of islets
were very prominent in the O-C group (Figure 4A and D).
Plasma levels of leptin were elevated significantly in
the O-C group than in both O-P and LETO groups from
20 weeks of age (Figure 4G), although there was no
significant difference in plasma adiponectin levels among
530
Dovepress
the groups (Figure 4H). As for the inflammatory cytokines,
significantly high levels of both TNF-α and IL-6 were
observed in the O-C group than in both O-P and LETO
groups (Figure 4I and J). Plasma GSH was significantly high
in the LETO group at 30 weeks of age, whereas these high
levels decreased to trace amounts at 60 weeks (Figure 4K),
although there was no significant difference among the
groups at week 60.
In relation to adipocyte inflammation, immunostaining
of macrophage-expressed CD68 and F4/80 in adipose tissue
was performed and an increased expression of both CD68
(Figure 5A-C) and F4/80 (Figure 5D-F) was found in the
O-C group than in both O-P and LETO groups.

Discussion
Our study distinctly demonstrated that long-term treatment
with d-psicose until 60 weeks exerted beneficial effects
against the progression of the sequences of T2DM and 
pancreatic β-cell damage in OLETF rats. Onset of T2DM occurs
on failure of β-cells, and among the proposed mechanisms of
β-cell failure, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, ER
stress, and amyloid deposition24 were mentioned, and almost
all these factors may induce islet inflammation.
Severe damage with marked β-cell loss in the 
nontreated O-C animals was observed with H&E staining
of the pancreas, and the damage was consistent with the
high levels of both serum IL-6 and TNF-α. The levels
of cytokines usually rise in insulin-resistant states, such
as obesity,25 impaired glucose tolerance,26 and T2DM.27
The most important source of both pro- (IL-6, TNF-α)
and anti-inflammatory (adiponectin) cytokines is visceral
adipose tissue,28 the aggregation of which was significantly
reduced in the animals treated with d-psicose (Figure 3G).
We think the inflammatory damage of β-cells was related
to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the
control animals, which, in turn, contributed to the 
development of insulin resistance and T2DM. As shown in
Figure 4A-F, the destructive damage of the islets was
observed in OLETF control rats but not in d-psicose-treated
OLETF rats at 60 weeks of age. Of course, no pathological
damage was observed at 10 weeks of age in all groups,
since diabetic onset usually starts around 20 weeks of
age. Therefore, it is assumed that the improvement of
insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome by d-psicose
Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2015:9
d-Psicose prevents diabetes development
treatment was facilitated through the control of 
proinflammatory cytokines after the onset of diabetes in OLETF
rats. A study has shown that obesity and obesity-related
metabolic disturbances were entangled with elevated 
low-grade noninfectious inflammation and oxidative stress.29
This obesity-associated inflammation originates mainly
in visceral white adipose tissue.30 Also, proinflammatory
cytokine IL-6 is released from inflamed adipocytes, which
in turn activate macrophages to release another cytokine,
TNF-α.31 Our results demonstrated that d-psicose treatment
exhibited significantly less macrophage infiltration in 
comparison to nontreated control rats (Figure 5), which in turn
resulted in decreased serum levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α
(Figure 4I and J). Hence, we could conclude that the 
antiinflammatory effect of d-psicose may indirectly suppress
the release of proinflammatory cytokines.
Additionally, d-psicose also exerted its anti-inflammatory
effects through the significant decrease in serum leptin levels
and thus contributed to the improvement of insulin 
resistance, although serum adiponectin levels were not altered.
Accumulation of macrophages in adipose tissue is closely
correlated with weight gain and insulin resistance in both
rodents and humans,32 and reduction of macrophage content
correlates with weight loss.3 The restoration of body weight
by d-psicose (Figure 2B) might be considered to be due to
the improvement of insulin resistance through the control
of glucose. d-Psicose prevented excess fat accumulation,
confirmed by decreased in vivo FM (Figure 3C) as well as
abdominal fat weight (Figure 3G), with the significant 
reduction in body mass index (Figure 3D).

Among the potential mechanisms of the toxic effects
of glucose on β-cell function is chronic oxidative stress
because glucose can generate ROS,33 which has adverse
effects on islet function.23,34 Moreover, pancreas contains trace
amounts of antioxidant enzymes and thus β-cells become
liable to be injured by oxidative stress. Elevation in GSH
level and super oxide dismutase may compensate oxidative
stress. Studies have shown d-psicose as a strong antioxidant
through the scavenging of ROS and expression of antioxidant
enzymes.35-37 d-Psicose, in the present study, significantly
restored the antioxidant GSH (Figure 4K), consistent with
an earlier report,38 although we were unable to detect super
oxide dismutase. Control of blood glucose level remains the
gold standard in the prevention and management of diabetic
complications.39 Treatment of OLETF rats with d-psicose
was found to control blood glucose levels uniquely till the
end of 60 weeks (Figure 1A). The oral glucose tolerance
test also revealed that the glucose tolerance was improved
(Figure 1C-E) with the significant restoration of insulin
(Figure 1F-H) secretion after the glucose load. Insulin
resistance initially leads to hyperinsulinemia,40 followed by
hypoinsulinemia when β-cell volume is reduced through
ROS-induced injury. Consistently, the present data showing
initial hyperinsulinemia and hypoinsulinemia afterward 
suggest β-cell proliferation followed by damage in the control
rats. d-Psicose treatment prevented β-cell injury through
its antioxidative effects and thus improved glucose 
tolerance, consistent with Lee et al’s findings in OLETF rats.41
Moreover, glycated hemoglobin A  is considered another
gold standard in monitoring glucose control in view of the
distinct relation between glucose and A  in both fasting and
postprandial periods.42,43 d-Psicose was able to reduce HbA
level (Figure 1M) through maintaining normoglycemia during
both fasting (Figure 1A) and postprandial (Figure 1L) periods.
Moreover, postprandial hyperglycemia itself is hazardous for
vascular diseases and thus considered as a predictive tool for
myocardial infarction and mortality.44 Vascular diseases are
mentioned as crucial results of elevated lipoproteins which
may also affect β-cell survival and function.45 Our study
confirmed the antihyperlipidemic effect of d-psicose with
significant decrease in serum LDL (Figure 3F), although the
protective HDL levels remained static all through (Figure 3E).
Studies have also demonstrated that insulin resistance is
a predisposing factor for dyslipidemia46 and that diabetic
dyslipidemia is typically marked by elevated TC, TG, and
LDL and decreased HDL, and these constitute an important
risk factor for T2DM.47 d-Psicose treatment also resulted in
significant decreases in plasma TC, TG, and LDL levels when
compared to those in control (Figure 3A and B).

The presented data strongly suggest the potential of
d-psicose in the commencement of diabetes rather than
being a “remedy” after diabetes is already established.
Although we have not tested this part, further investigation
remains on process to clarify this issue. However, our results
demonstrated that prolonged treatment with the rare sugar
d-psicose maintained blood glucose levels, lipid profile with
the amelioration of oxidative stress, and proinflammatory
cytokines in T2DM in OLETF rats.
Finally, in addition to making functional foods, d-psicose
might be used as a combination drug, not only for 
antihyperglycemic effect but also to counter some side effects marked
by the chronic use of antidiabetic agents.

Figure  4  changes  in  light  microscopic  features  of  pancreas  of  rats  of  all  groups  at  week  60  with  long-term  treatment  with  or  without  rare  sugar  d-psicose. 
Notes:  The  O-P  group  was  treated  with  5%  d-psicose  dissolved  in  drinking  water,  where  O-c  and  non-diabetic  leTO  were  fed  drinking  water  only.  all  the  rats  were  
supplied  a  standard  rat  diet.  changes  of  the  pancreas  of  O-c  (A),  O-P  (B),  and  leTO  (C)  rats  stained  with  HE  at  age  60  weeks  during  sacrifice.  (A)  islet  disorganization  with  
severe  fibrosis,  atrophy,  and  markedly  infiltrated  inflammatory  cells.  (B)  Some  islets  were  enlarged,  but  minimal  fibrosis  and  infiltration  of  inflammatory  cells  were  observed  
in  the  pancreas  in  d-psicose-treated  rats.  (C)  histological  changes  were  absent  or  rarely  observed  in  the  pancreas  of  nondiabetic  control  leTO  rats.  The  table  adjacent  
to  the  he  pictures  depicts  the  number  of  different-sized  islets  in  all  groups,  with  almost  absent  intact  large  and  medium-size  islets  in  the  O-c  group  in  comparison  to  O-P  
and  leTO  groups.  (D-F)  show  immunofluorescence  staining  for  insulin  (red  color)  stained  with  anti-insulin  antibody  and  glucagon  (green  color)  stained  with  antiglucagon  
antibody  to  identify  the  presence  and  organization  of  both  β-   and  α-cells  in  the  pancreas  at  age  60  weeks.  (G,  H)  serial  changes  of  serum  levels  of  leptin  and  adiponectin,  
respectively.  (I-K)  show  serum  levels  of  TnF-α  and  il-6  at  age  30  weeks,  and  serum  gsh  at  ages  30  and  60  weeks.  aSignificant  difference  versus  O-C  group  at  corresponding  
age.  bSignificant  difference  versus  O-P  group  at  corresponding  age.  Values  are  expressed  as  mean  ±  sD  (n=9  for  OLETF  rats  and  n=6  for  LETO  rats).  Magnification:  ×40;  scale  
bars: 500 µm (Figures A-C). Magnification: ×200; scale bars: 100 µm (Figures D-F).

Figure  5  immunohistochemical  staining  of  cD68-expressing  neutrophils  (A-C)  and  F4/80-expressing  macrophages  (D-F)  in  adipose  tissue  of  rats  of  all  groups  at  week  
60 with long-term treatment with or without rare sugar d-psicose. 
Notes:  The  O-P  group  was  treated  with  5%  d-psicose  dissolved  in  drinking  water,  where  O-c  and  non-diabetic  leTO  were  fed  drinking  water  only.  all  the  rats  were  
supplied  a  standard  rat  diet.  arrows  indicate  positive-stained  cells  for  cD68  in  O-c  (A),  O-P  (B),  and  leTO  (C),  and  for  F4/80  in  O-c  (D),  O-P  (E),  and  leTO  (F).  
Black circle in D indicates positive-stained cells in the circle. Magnification: ×400. scale bars: 50 µm.
