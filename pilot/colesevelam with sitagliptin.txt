combination of colesevelam with sitagliptin enhances glycemic

doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00295.2011.-Bile acid
sequestrants have been
shown to reduce glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. We
previously reported that the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam HCl
(Welchol) (COL) induced the release of glucagon-like peptide
(GLP)-1 and improved glycemic control in insulin-resistant rats. In
the present study, we tested whether adding sitagliptin (Januvia)
(SIT), which prolongs bioactive GLP-1 half life, to COL would
further enhance glycemic control. Male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)
rats were assigned to four groups: diabetic model without treatment
(the model), the model treated with 2% COL or 0.4% (120 mg/day)
SIT alone, or with the combination (COLSIT). After 4 wk of
treatment, the glucose area under the curve (AUC) was reduced more
in the COLSIT than the COL although both groups showed 
decreased glucose AUC with increased AUC of bioactive GLP-1 (GLP-
1A) compared with the model group. The above changes were not
observed after 8 wk. Increasing the SIT dose by 50% (180 mg
SIT/day) in the diet reduced the glucose AUC in the COLSIT group
even after 8 wk but still not in the SIT alone group compared with the
model. It was noteworthy that, after 8 wk, insulin levels in the SIT
group declined to levels similar to the model. Histological 
examination of the pancreatic -cell islets showed that islet sizes were larger,
proliferation enhanced, and cell apoptosis reduced in the COLSIT
but not the SIT alone group compared with the model. We 
hypothesize that the combination of COL with SIT extends the half life of
COL-induced GLP-1A and benefits preservation of the islets that
delay the development of diabetes and improve glycemic control. This
study suggests that the combined therapy (COLSIT) is more 
effective than either drug alone for reducing glucose levels in diabetes.

RECENT STUDIES INDICATE that bile acid sequestrants, which block
bile acid absorption in the intestine, improve hyperglycemia in
diabetic animal models (22)
as well as in patients with type 2
diabetes (2). Although various hypotheses have been proposed,
the specific mechanism(s) by which bile acid sequestrants
improve glycemic control remain unclear. Colesevelam HCl
(Welchol) (COL) is an FDA-approved bile acid sequestrant,
and, recently, several clinical studies have demonstrated that
COL improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes (3, 10, 13-14).
We recently found that COL induced the release of 
gluca-gon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and suggested that the enhanced

GLP-1 levels were responsible for improved glycemic control
in insulin-resistant diet-induced obese rats (25). This 
hypothesis was supported by a study from another group (6) that
cholestyramine, a classical older bile acid sequestrant, 
enhanced GLP-1 levels and improved glycemic control in male
Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, a type 2 diabetic rat model.
However, the induced active GLP-1 has a very short half-life,
as it is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4),
which cleaves the NH2-terminal dipeptides from GLP-1 in the
intestine (15, 20). It is well known that sitagliptin (SIT) is a
specific inhibitor of DPP4 that effectively prolongs the half-life
of bioactive GLP-1 (GLP-1A) (4, 16, 21, 24).
As SIT might prolong the half-life of COL-induced 
bioactive GLP-1, we reasoned that the combination of SIT with
COL might strengthen the beneficial effect of COL on 
glycemic control. In the present study, we tested whether adding SIT
with COL would produce better glycemic control than each
drug alone in type 2 diabetic rat models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal studies. Studies were conducted in type 2 diabetic rat
model, male ZDF rats. To produce the type 2 diabetic model, fat male
ZDF rats were fed Purina special diet no. 5008 (WF Fisher and Son,
Bound Brook, NJ). Studies were carried out in male, 5-wk-old
(250-325 g) ZDF rats that were purchased from Charles River,
Kingston, NY. Two major studies were conducted in the animals, and
the subgroups in these two studies were similar except that the dose of
SIT (Januvia; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Rome, Italy) mixed in the diet
was increased 50% in the second study.
Part 1 of the study consisted of four treatment groups: 1) fat male
ZDF rats fed Purina special diet 5008 as untreated positive controls or
the model group (5008, n  8); 2) fat male ZDF rats fed Purina 5008
containing 0.4% SIT, (120 mg/day, 200 mg of sitagliptin/kg body
wt per day) as the type 2 diabetic model treated with SIT alone (SIT,
n  8); 3) fat male ZDF rats fed Purina 5008 containing 2% COL as
the type 2 diabetic model treated with colesevelam alone (COL, n
8); and 4) fat male ZDF rats fed Purina 5008 containing 2% COL
0.4% SIT (COLSIT, n 8) as the type 2 diabetic model treated with
the combination of COLSIT.
In part 2 of the study, the dose of SIT (Januvia) in the diet was
increased 50% to 0.6% (180 mg/day, 300 mg/kg body wt per day).
Part 2 also consisted of four treatment groups: 1) fat male ZDF rats
fed special diet Purina 5008 (5008, n  8); 2) fat male ZDF rats fed
Purina special diet 5008 containing 0.6% SIT (0.6% SIT, n  8);
3) fat male ZDF rats fed Purina special diet 5008 containing 2% COL
(COL, n  8); and 4) fat male ZDF rats fed Purina special diet 5008
containing 2% COL  0.6% SIT (COL0.6%SIT, n  8).
The special rat diets for different treatments (SIT, COL, and
COLSIT) were made by Purina, TestDiet, Richmond, IN. The
studies started when the ZDF rats were 6 wk of age. All rats were
treated for at least 8 wk, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were
performed after 4 and 8 wk of treatment, respectively, to evaluate and
G815

compare the effectiveness of treatments on glycemic control. The
animals then were killed after 2 days of further treatment. Under
anesthesia, pancreas tissues were collected for evaluation of changes
in -cell islets. The contents/soft feces within the lumen of the ileum
and ascending colon were collected and weighed, respectively. The
mucosa of ileum and ascending colon were collected and frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen for measurement of mRNA expression
of TGR5 in the intestine. The animal protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, East Orange, New Jersey.
OGTT. The rats that underwent OGTT were fasted overnight (from
4 PM to 8 AM). Immediately before the feeding of glucose, blood
sample was taken via the tail and used as fasting baseline glucose
levels (at 0 min). Glucose was then fed to rats at 200 mg/100 g body
wt by gavage. Blood specimens were collected from the tail at 15, 30,
60, 90, and 120 min after the initiation of glucose feeding. Changes in
plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and bioactive GLP-1 (GLP-1A)
were measured.
Postprandial test. To determine the changes in the postprandial
response in plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP-1A in these rats after
different treatments, postprandial tests were performed 1 wk after the
second OGTT (after 9 wk of the treatment). The tested ZDF rats were
fasted overnight (4 PM to 8 AM). At 8 AM the rats were fed relevant
special diet, respectively, for 2 h and then the diets were removed. The
special diets were prepared as such that the powder of daily dose of
drug mixed into 1 g of peanut butter (SKIPPY, Alameda, CA),
respectively. The daily dose for COL was 0.6 g, and that for SIT was
120 mg. The untreated models were only fed 1 g of peanut butter.
Blood samples were collected from the tail immediately prior (at 0)
and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the initiation of diet feeding. Thus blood
samples at 3 and 4 h reflected the responses/changes in plasma
glucose/insulin/GLP-1A 1 or 2 h, respectively, after the meal.
Immunofluorescence staining of -cell islets. To show and compare
the size of -cell islets in the pancreas, immunofluorescence staining
was performed using anti-insulin antibody. The collected rat pancreas
tissues were placed in 10% formalin at 4°C overnight. The tissues
were then immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for at least 24 h.
Serial 16-m sections were cut on a cryostat. All the pancreatic
sections were blocked for 2 h in 0.4% Triton X-100  4% goat serum
in PBS. Then the sections were incubated with guinea pig polyclonal
to insulin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) diluted (1: 100) in PBS
with 0.4% Triton X-100  4% goat serum. The incubation was
performed at 4°C overnight. After several washes with PBS, the
sections were incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa 
Fluor488-conjugated Donkey Anti-Guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted with 1% goat serum (1: 250).
The slides were examined under 10 magnification using a digital
camera (model CF2 camera) attached to the ECLIPSE Ti Series
microscope (Nikon) and processed with an NIS-Elements BR3.1
Image software program.
TUNEL assay for -cell apoptosis. To evaluate the degree of cell
apoptosis in -cell islets, the above insulin antibody-stained 
pancreatic sections (slides before mounting) were further subjected to 
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay (11). ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Millipore, Temecula, CA) was used to detect cell apoptosis (DNA
fragmentation) by labeling the terminal end of nucleic acids. The
sections were fixed in ethanol: acetic acid (2: 1) at 20°C for 10 min,
and, after being washed twice with PBS, they were incubated with
equilibration buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The sections
were then incubated in a buffer solution with TUNEL at 37°C for 1 h.
After the reaction
was stopped by PBS, the sections were further
incubated with CY-3 Mouse Anti-Digoxin (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories) in PBS solution (1: 200) at room temperature for 1 h.
The stained apoptotic cells within the insulin antibody-stained -cell
islet were examined under 20 magnification using a digital camera
(model CF2 camera) attached to the ECLIPSE Ti Series microscope

(Nikon) and processed with an NIS-Elements BR3.1 Image computer
program.
Double immunofluorescence staining for insulin and Ki-67. The
procedure of this double staining was similar to that described above
in Immunofluorescence staining of -cell islets except that another
antibody (for staining KI-67) Rabbit mAb to Ki-67 (Abcam) was
added simultaneously with the guinea pig insulin antibody, and
Dylight 549-Conjugated Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (Jackson) was
added with the Anti-Guinea Pig IgG in the later procedure.
Measurement of bile acid concentrations. Bile acid concentrations
(mM) in portal blood were determined by gas-liquid chromatography
(Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA), which was equipped with a fused
silica CP-Sil 5-CB capillary column as described previously (25).
A measured proportion of the weighed total dried intestinal content
was used to determine the intestinal bile acid concentrations (mM)
using the routine autoclave, gas-liquid chromatography method 
available at our laboratory, as described previously (1).
Measurement of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1A. Plasma glucose
concentrations were determined by Glucose Analyzer (Analox, 
London, UK). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by Rat
Insulin RIA kit (RI-13K; Millipore).
The concentration of GLP-1A, the biologically active form of
GLP-1 (7-36 and 7-37 amide) was determined using GLP-1 RIA kit
(GLP1A-35HK; Millipore) according to the instruction of the 
manufacturer. Briefly, the blood specimens were collected in ice-cooled
EDTA-tubes with DPP4 inhibitor. Sample plasma specimens were
extracted with 95% ethyl alcohol. After the alcohol was evaporated,
the samples were rehydrated. GLP-1A antibody was then added and
incubated overnight at 4°C. 125I-GLP-1 was added to label the bound
GLP-1A, which was then precipitated with carrier Ig and precipitating
reagent. After centrifuging the samples, the 125I-GLP-1A in the pellet
was counted using the COBRA II Auto-Gamma.
Measurement of TGR5 mRNA expression. TGR5 expression in the
mucosa of ileum and ascending colon was quantitatively determined
with qRT-PCR described previously (25). TaqMan Expression Assays
(Gpbar 1-Rn 01400316_S1) designed by Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, CA) specifically for rat TGR5 was used, and reactions were
performed in triplicate in a 7300 Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied
Biosystems). The data were calculated by the comparative threshold
cycle method using GAPDH as the internal standard. The relative
mRNA expression shown in the text is presented as the ratio between
the untreated diabetic model (5008) and treated groups.
Statistical analysis. The data reported in figures and text are
presented as means  SE except those listed in tables, which are
presented as means  SD. The statistical significance for multiple
comparisons was analyzed with the Bonferroni method. When only
two groups were compared, Student’s t-test was used and would be
stated specifically. GraphPad InStat V.3 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) software was used for all statistical comparisons.
RESULTS
OGTT. In part 1 of the study, SIT was in the diet at 0.4%
(120 mg/day). Figure 1A1 summarizes the results of plasma
glucose levels (shown as means  SE) during the OGTT after
different treatments for 4 wk in male fat ZDF rats. The results
indicated that, at fasting baseline plasma, glucose levels were
significantly (P 	 0.001) reduced in the COLSIT 
combination, and COL alone groups compared with the untreated
diabetic rat models (5008). During OGTT, plasma glucose
levels became significantly lower (P 	 0.01) than in the
diabetic model group after 60 min in the COLSIT group and
after 90 min in the COL group. Glucose area under the curve
(AUC) during OGTT was reduced in the COLSIT (40%, P
0.001) and COL (27%, P 	 0.05) groups compared with the
untreated diabetic model group. The AUC of the COLSIT
group was significantly smaller (P	 0.01) than the COL alone
group when only these two groups were compared using
Student’s t-test. There was no significant reduction in glucose
levels/AUC during OGTT in the group treated with SIT alone.
After the above treatments were continued in the same
animals for 4 additional wk (8 wk of total treatment), glucose
levels were increased at each time point (Fig. 1A2) compared
with 4 wk of treatment (Fig. 1A1). Although the mean values
of plasma glucose levels were numerically lower in the group

treated with COLSIT, the difference was not statistically
significant between the COLSIT-treated diabetic model and
the untreated diabetic model (5008) as analyzed by 
multicom-parison (Bonferroni method). The fasting glucose level before
OGTT in the COLSIT group was 34% lower (248  72 vs.
375  110 mg/dl) than the untreated diabetic model group.
Figure 1B1 shows plasma insulin levels in different groups
during OGTT after 4 wk of treatment. Insulin AUC increased
90% and 83%, respectively, in the COLSIT (P 	 0.05) and
G818
COL (P 	 0.05) groups compared with the untreated diabetic
model group. Although insulin AUC in the SIT group also
increased 61%, the increase was not significant compared with
the untreated model group. Continuing the treatments for 8 wk,
plasma insulin levels in the COLSIT and COL groups were
higher (P 	 0.05) at 0, 15, and 120 min than the untreated
model. Although insulin AUC in these two groups increased
79% and 65%, respectively, the increase was not statistically
significant compared with the untreated model group. It should
INDUCING GLP-1 DELAYS DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES IN RAT MODEL

be pointed out that, different from that after 4 wk of treatment,
insulin levels of the SIT group after 8 wk declined to almost the
same level of the untreated model group (5008) (Fig. 1B2).
Figure 1C1 shows that, after 4 wk of treatment, plasma
levels of the active form of GLP-1 (GLP-1A) increased during
OGTT in all three treatment groups compared with the 
untreated diabetic model group although the increase in the COL
group was not as high as in the COLSIT or SIT groups. The
AUC of GLP-1A increased in the COLSIT (2.5-fold, P
0.001), SIT (82%, P 	 0.01), and COL (53%, P 	 0.05)
groups compared with the untreated diabetic models. 
Furthermore, the AUC of the combination group (COLSIT) was
significantly larger than the SIT (P 	 0.01) and COL (P
0.001) alone groups. After 8 wk of treatment, plasma GLP-1A
levels remained higher in the treatment groups compared with
the untreated model during OGTT. The AUC of GLP-1A was
increased twofold in the COLSIT (P 	 0.001), 52% in the
SIT (P 	 0.001), and 22% in the COL (P 	 0.01) group,
respectively, compared with the untreated diabetic model. The
AUC of GLP-1A in the combination group was also larger than
the SIT (P 	 0.001) and COL (P 	 0.001) group at this stage.
In part 2, SIT in the diet was increased 50% from 0.4% (120
mg/day) to 0.6% (180 mg/day). Similar to that observed in part
1, 4 wk of treatment with increased SIT alone did not improve
glycemic control (Fig. 2A1). Again, glucose levels during
OGTT after 4 wk of treatment significantly decreased in the
COLSIT group as well as the COL group (Fig. 2A1). Glucose
AUC decreased 48% and 33% in the COLSIT (P 	 0.001)
and COL (P 	 0.01) groups, respectively, compared with
the untreated diabetic model group (5008). The AUC of the
COLSIT group was smaller (P 	 0.05) than the AUC of
the COL group when analyzed by Student’s t-test. 
Continuing the treatment for 8 wk, different from that seen in part
1, glucose levels during OGTT were reduced significantly in
the COL0.6% SIT group. Glucose AUC in the COL0.6%
SIT was 43% (P 	 0.001) less than the untreated diabetic
model group (5008). However, the glucose levels in the 0.6%
SIT group were still not improved (Fig. 2A2) compared with
that in the 0.4% SIT or the model group although SIT dose
increased from 120 mg to 180 mg/day.
As shown in Fig. 2B1, after 4 wk of treatment, insulin levels
in all three treatment groups were higher than the untreated
model group during OGTT. Insulin AUC was significantly
larger in the COLSIT (83%, P 	 0.001), COL (58%, P
0.01), and SIT (54%, P	 0.01) groups, respectively, compared
with the untreated model group. After 8 wk of treatment,
similar to the 0.4%SIT in part 1, insulin levels in the 0.6%SIT
group declined to the same level as the untreated diabetic
model group during OGTT (Fig. 2B2). However, insulin levels
in the COLSIT and COL groups remained higher than the
model group. Insulin AUC in these two groups was fourfold
(COL0.6% SIT, P 	 0.001) and threefold (COL, P 	 0.001)
of that in the untreated model group.
GLP-1A levels were elevated in all three treatment groups
(Fig. 2C1) after 4 wk of treatment during OGTT although the
increase in the COL group was not as much as that in the
COLSIT or SIT groups. AUC of GLP-1A increased twofold
(P 	 0.001) in the COL SIT, 64% (P 	 0.001) in the SIT,
and 20% (P 	 0.05) in the COL group compared with the
diabetic model group. After the treatment was continued for 8
wk, GLP-1A levels during OGTT remained elevated in all the
three groups (Fig. 2C2). The AUC of GLP-1A was increased
2.4-fold (P 	 0.001) in the combination group, 85% (P
0.001) in the SIT, and 32% (P 	 0.01) in the COL group,
respectively, compared with the untreated diabetic model
group.
Postprandial test. Figure 3 summarizes changes in the 
postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP-1A levels in the
untreated and treated rat diabetic models. During the test, the
special diet was provided to the rats only during the first 2 h.

The fasting glucose levels in the COL and COLSIT groups
were lower (P 	 0.05) than the untreated model group (Fig.
3A). In the combination group (COLSIT), glucose levels
were significantly lower than the untreated model group at each
time point. The AUC of glucose was 47% smaller in the
COLSIT group (P 	 0.01) compared with the untreated
model group (5008). Although in the COL group the AUC of
glucose was not significantly decreased, the postprandial 
glucose levels were 33% lower than the untreated model at 3 h (P
0.01) and 4 h (P 	 0.05), respectively. That means the glucose
levels in the COL group had been significantly lower than the
untreated models 1 h (at 3 h) after stopping the diet feeding to
the rats. Glucose levels in the SIT group were not significantly
reduced after the meal.

INDUCING GLP-1 DELAYS DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES IN RAT MODEL
The plasma insulin levels were increased sharply after the
meal was given in the COLSIT and COL groups compared
with the model (5008) and did not decline in the combination
(COLSIT) group (Fig. 3B). In contrast, insulin levels in the
SIT group were similar to the model. The AUC of insulin
during the postprandial test was larger in the COLSIT (3-
fold, P	 0.01) and the COL (2.6-fold, P	 0.05) group than
the model group.
The fasting GLP-1A levels in the plasma (Fig. 3C) were
significantly higher in the COLSIT (P 	 0.001), SIT (P
0.001), and COL (P 	 0.05) groups compared with the
untreated model group. The AUC of GLP-1A during this
test was larger in the COLSIT (2-fold, P 	 0.001), SIT
(62%, P 	 0.001), and COL (31%, P 	 0.05) groups
than the untreated model. The AUC of GLP-1A in the
combination group (COLSIT) was also significantly larger
than the SIT (P 	 0.01) and COL (P 	 0.001) groups.
Size of -cell islets in pancreas. Figure 4A is a set of
pancreatic tissue sections with immunofluorescence staining
showing the -cell islet from different treatment groups after 8
wk of treatment. Obviously, in the SIT (120 mg/day, 0.4%)
group, -cell islets labeled with the anti-insulin antibody
shrank to the size similar to those in the untreated diabetic
model. After 8 wk of treatment, the maximal size of islets in
the (0.4%) SIT group was reduced 45% (P 	 0.05 by t-test) as
compared that after 4 wk (Table 1). The area size of the -cell
islet in the SIT group was similar to the untreated model group.
In contrast, the size of the islet in the COL group and the
COL0.4%SIT group was 2.1-fold (P	 0.01) and 2.9-fold (P
0.001) of that in the untreated models after 4 wk of treatment and
was 2.6-fold (P 	 0.001) and 3.4-fold (P 	 0.001), respectively,
after 8 wk. Furthermore, the size of the islet in the COL group and
the COL0.4%SIT group was also larger than the SIT alone
group after 4 wk of treatment (P 	 0.05 and P 	 0.001) and
after 8 wk (P 	 0.01 and P 	 0.001), respectively. After 8 wk
of treatment, the islet size was not significantly changed in the
COL or COLSIT group as compared those after 4 wk of the
same treatment (Table 1). There was no significant difference
in the islet size between the combination of COL with 0.4%
SIT and that with increased 0.6% SIT.
Evaluation of -cell apoptosis and proliferation. To 
compare the status of cell apoptosis, TUNEL assay (11) was
employed to stain the apoptotic cells in the islets. We noticed
that more apoptotic cells were observed in the untreated model
group than the COLSIT and COL group. There were always
several (1 to 3) spots (in red color) of stained apoptotic cells
seen in the islet sections from the untreated model group and
usually one stained spot in the sections from the SIT alone

group. However, in the islet sections from the COLSIT or
COL groups, virtually no stained spot of apoptotic cell was
observed (Fig. 4B).
In the present study, Ki-67 (12) was used as the marker for
the -cell proliferation, as Ki-67 protein expression is strictly
correlated to cell proliferation and the active phases of the cell
cycle. As shown in Fig. 4C, the stained Ki-67 spots (in red
color) are much more numerous in the sections from the
COLSIT group than the untreated model or SIT groups.
Furthermore, we used the ratio of red-colored Ki-67 intensity
(the marker of active cell proliferation) vs. green-colored
insulin intensity (the mass of -cells) as an indicator of the
activities of proliferation in the islets. The ratio in the
COLSIT group (0.0165  0.0191, means  SD) was 9.7-
fold (P	 0.05) of that in the untreated model group (0.0017
0.0010).
Thus the activities of cell proliferation in the islets of
the combination group were significantly more than the 
untreated model. Although the ratios in the COL (0.0104
0.0073)
and SIT (0.0034  0024) group were sixfold and
twofold of that in the model group, the differences were not
statistically significant.
Bile acid concentrations in the intestine. Table 2 
summarizes the total bile acid concentrations (mM) in the wet contents
collected from the lumen of terminal ileum and ascending
colon, respectively. The data indicate that bile acid 
concentrations in the ileum were not significantly increased in 
COL-treated diabetic ZDF rat models in either the COL or the
COLSIT groups compared with those in the untreated 
diabetic model group where the ZDF rats were only fed Purina
diet 5008. However, bile acid concentrations in the ascending
colon of the untreated diabetic models decreased almost 70%
(P 	 0.001) compared with that in the ileum, whereas the bile
acid concentration did not decrease significantly in those
treated with COL or COLSIT. As a result, bile acid 
concentrations in the colon were higher in the COL (P 	 0.01) or
COLSIT (P 	 0.001) groups than the untreated diabetic
model group.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated that COL combined with
SIT produced better glycemic control than each single drug in
the diabetic ZDF rat model. We believe that this combination
enhanced the beneficial effects of COL. SIT extends the
half-life of bioactive GLP-1, which is induced by COL. It is
known that bioactive GLP-1 reduces insulin resistance and
improves glycemic control (17, 7). Our study demonstrated
that the combination treatment (COLSIT) resulted in the
highest levels of active GLP-1 and lowest levels of glucose
among the four experimental groups. Furthermore, in the
combination of COL0.6%SIT, where the dose of SIT 
increased 50%, the degradation of active GLP-1 was more
strongly inhibited, which resulted in even better glycemic
control than the COL0.4% SIT. The combination of COL
with 0.6% SIT reduced plasma glucose levels during the
OGTT not only after 4 wk but also after 8 wk (Fig. 2A2),
whereas COL0.4% SIT did not (Fig. 1A2) compared with the
model group. These two findings together support the 
hypothesis that the combination improved glycemic control by

creasing the bioactive form of GLP-1 in the plasma. We
noticed that, in the present study, treatment with either COL
alone or the combination of COLSIT did not significantly
reduce the chow intakes and body weights in the ZDF rat
model. Therefore, the improvement of glycemic control 
mentioned above was not attributable to decrease in body fat but
rather the increased active GLP-1.
It was unexpected that SIT alone did not show a significant
effect on improving glucose levels in this diabetic ZDF rat
model. It suggested that SIT may be ineffective in some animal
models. However, SIT alone in the present study served as a
negative control and suggested that the significant 
improvement of glycemic control in the combination group is mainly
attributable to the beneficial effects of COL.
We noticed that, after 8 wk of treatment in the SIT alone
group, either 0.4% (120 mg/day) or 0.6% (180 mg/day) plasma
insulin declined to the levels similar to the untreated diabetic
model (Figs. 1B2 and 2B2). The diminished insulin levels in
the SIT group suggested that at this stage (8 wk) -cell islets
were as severely damaged as in the untreated model group and
too exhausted to secrete sufficient insulin in response to 
glucose and GLP-1 challenges. The marked shrinking of -cell
islets observed in the SIT group after 8 wk (see Fig. 4A and
Table 1) mirrored the diminished plasma insulin levels. The
data explain why, during the OGTT performed after 8 wk, the
insulin files (low insulin levels) did not reflect the profiles of
GLP-1A (high GLP-1A levels) as seen in Figs. 1 and 2, B2 and
C2. It also suggested that diabetes developed in the SIT group
as severely as the untreated diabetic model at this stage. It is
clear that, with or without colesevelam, treatment makes 
significant difference in preservation of -cell islets in this type 2
diabetic rat model. In either the COL alone or COL combined
with SIT groups, the size of -cell islets was always 
significantly larger than those without COL (the model and SIT alone
groups). It seems that, unless the -cell islets were severely
damaged such that plasma insulin levels were significantly
reduced, the significant shrinking in the islet size would not be
observed. This finding, on the other hand, demonstrates that
COL or COL combined with SIT preserves the -cell islets in
this diabetic rat model to delay the development of diabetes
and that COL plays an essential role in this improvement.
However, it must be emphasized that combination of COL with
SIT produced better improvement in glycemic control than
COL alone. Present study provided evidence that the reduction
of glucose (AUC) either during the OGTT or in the 
postprandial test was greater in the combination group (COLSIT)
than the COL alone and that the AUC of GLP-1A in the
combination group was larger than the COL group, and

liferation in -cell islets indicated by stained Ki-67 was 
significantly enhanced in the combination group but not the COL
compared with the model group. More importantly, at 8 wk,
glycemic control was significantly improved only in the 
combination group (COL  180 mg/day SIT) but not in the COL
alone group compared with the model group. Again, the above
findings further support the hypothesis that the COL-induced
GLP-1A is the essential cause responsible for the improvement
of glycemic control.
Recent study suggested that infusing bioactive GLP-1 to
diabetic ZDF rat models would increase the size (area) of
-cell islets, enhance proliferation of -cells, and inhibit -cell
apoptosis (5). In the present study, we also found that -cell
apoptosis was reduced in the COLSIT and COL groups and
that proliferation was enhanced in the COLSIT group 
compared with the model group. We propose that the preservation
of -cell islets is the result of reduced apoptosis and enhanced
proliferation because COL enhances release of GLP-1 and
combination of COL with SIT prolongs and increases the
bioactivity of the COL induced GLP-1. Consequently, 
development of type 2 diabetes is slowed in this ZDF rat model, and
that should be the major mechanism by which glycemic control
is improved.
It is known that activation of TGR5, a bile acid receptor
located superficially in the ileum and colon (19, 23), can
stimulate L-cells to release GLP-1 (18, 26). In the present
study, we carefully observed whether the elevated plasma
GLP-1A levels in the COL or COLSIT groups were caused
via activation of TGR5 in the ileum and colon, as COL was
expected to diminish intestinal bile acid absorption and 
increases bile acid concentrations in the intestine. It has been
reported that infusing taurocholate solution at a concentration
of 10 mM does not increase but 20 mM does increase secretion
of GLP-1 from an isolated vascularly perfused rat ileum (8).
However, our data show that bile acid concentrations in the
ileum were not significantly increased in COL-treated diabetic
rat models in either the COL or the COLSIT groups 
compared with those in the untreated diabetic model group. In the
untreated diabetic model group, bile acid concentrations in the
contents collected from the ascending colon decreased 70% (P
0.001) compared with that in the ileum. This decrease was due
to the function of ileum where 95% of the bile acids are
reabsorbed from the ileal lumen and returned to the liver via
portal system. However, because of the effect of COL, which
sequesters bile acids in the lumen of intestine to diminish bile
acid reabsorption, the bile acid concentration in the colon of
the COL-treated diabetic models (the COL or COLSIT
groups) did not decrease and remained at a level significantly
higher than that in the untreated diabetic model group. 
However, total bile acid concentrations inside the lumen of either
ileum or colon were all lower than 5 mM in both the untreated
diabetic model or COL-treated models (the COL or COLSIT
groups). This finding suggests that the concentrations of bile
acids within the lumen of ileum or colon in the ZDF models
were all below the threshold required to activate TGR5. It
remains to be clarified whether the relatively higher bile acid
concentration in the colon of the COL-treated rats would cause
activation of TGR5 and stimulate L-cells in the colon to release
GLP-1. Thus, regarding the mechanism how COL induces
GLP-1 release, we prefer to favor our earlier hypothesis (25)
that COL diminishes uptake of fatty acids in the jejunum by
sequestering bile acids, which should have been available to
form micelles. Consequently, increased amounts of fatty acids
reach L-cells in the ileum to stimulate GLP-1 secretion.
In summary, this study demonstrated that the combination of
COL with SIT resulted in better improvement of glycemic
control than COL or SIT alone in this ZDF diabetic rat model.
This improvement was mainly due to induction of GLP-1
secretion plus reduction of active GLP-1 degradation such that
apoptosis was reduced and proliferation enhanced in -cell
islets. We postulate that the combination of COL with SIT or
even COL alone delays the development of diabetes in the ZDF
rat model by preserving -cell islets.
