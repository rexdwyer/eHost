>>>section: methods
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal strains and spore suspensions. A trichothecene-producing strain
of S. chartarum was obtained from Harriet Burge (Environmental 
Microbiology Lab, San Bruno, CA) (Rao et al., 2000) and grown on potato dextrose agar
(PDA) plates at 15C. Spores were vacuumed from the surface of 21-day agar
cultures using a modified filter cassette with a 37-mm, 0.4-lm polycarbonate
ROSENBLUM LICHTENSTEIN ET AL.
membrane filter (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA). After the spores were
removed from the filter, they were suspended in D-PBS (Mediatech Inc.,
Herndon, VA) at the desired concentration, as measured under light microscopy
at 3200 in a hemocytometer chamber. Minor hyphal fragment content and
negligible spore clumping were observed; most spores were ovoid in shape
with a mean size of 6 3 9 lm. Two Stachybotrys chemotypes have been
described-an atranone-producing chemotype and a trichothecenes-producing
chemotype (Andersen et al., 2002, 2003; Rand et al., 2006). The S. chartarum
strain described in this study is a trichothecene-producing chemotype.
SG ELISA. SG levels in the spore suspension were measured by a modified
competitive direct ELISA (Chung et al., 2003a). Briefly, SG antibody was diluted
in PBS (1:10,000), coated on microtiter plates (100 ll/well), and incubated
overnight at 4C. Plates were washed and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS at 25C for 1 h. SG standards (0-500 ng/ml) were made,
and SG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was diluted (1:4000 [v/v]) in 1% (w/v)
BSA in PBS. Equal volumes of diluted SG horseradish peroxidase conjugate
(50 ll) and standards diluted similarly were then mixed and incubated in
microtiter plates at 25C for 1 h. Plates were washed, and bound peroxidase was
determined by 100 ll/well incubation with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine
(Neogen, Lansing, MI) at 25C for 0.5 h. Color reaction was stopped with 2N
sulfuric acid (100 ll/well), and plates were read at 450 nm wavelength on ELISA
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). SG concentrations in samples
were determined from the standard curve using Softmax software (Molecular
Devices).
Dual radiolabeled spores. Stachybotrys chartarum spores were streaked
onto PDA plates supplemented with 1 ml of D-[U-14C] glucose (287 mCi/
mmol, 200 lCi/ml; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and 1 ml of
[6-3H] thymidine (23 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Growth conditions and harvesting were as described above. The dual label
enabled tracing of both spore DNA and carbohydrate components such as the
cell wall and glycosylated proteins. Spores were washed with saline four times
prior to use to remove any unincorporated radiolabel. After the fourth wash, no
radiolabel was detectable in the wash fluid.
Animal care. Animal use protocols for these experiments were approved
by the committee on animal experiments, and all institutional and federal
guidelines on animal care and handling were followed. Male BALB/c (Taconic,
Germantown, NY) and C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
were housed at the Harvard Animal Facilities for a minimum 1-week
acclimation period, fed Purina Mouse Chow and water ad libitum, and kept
on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All mice in these experiments were age matched
(7-10 weeks). All experiments described below were performed on both mouse
strains concurrently.
In Vivo spore clearance. Spores suspensions were delivered into the lungs
of both mouse strains by intratracheal instillation (IT) at 7.5 ± 1 weeks. Each
mouse received 6.25 3 105 (a concentration of 107 spores/ml saline in 62.5 ll
saline) spores per 25-g body weight for the quantitative clearance experiments
(visual counting) and 6.25 3 104 spores per mouse (not adjusted for body
weight) for the radiolabeled clearance experiments. We used the same volume
for all the animals in the experiments to standardize the administered
radioactive dose from day to day.
Between six and twelve mice per day were administered spores. On each
day, the order of the strains was randomly alternated. At least three animals for
each strain and time were sacrificed, and organs were harvested. The amount of
radioactivity in the delivered dose was quantified by delivering an equivalent
quantity of spore suspension to a vial (n ¼ 4) for digestion (see below) and
subsequent counting of radioactivity.
Immediately after the spore instillation and 24 h later, the mice were
humanely killed by an intraperitoneal lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital
(Anthony Products Co., Arcadia, CA) (10 mg/mouse). Mice were then
exsanguinated by cutting the abdominal aorta and by puncturing the
hemidiaphragm to create a bilateral pneumothorax. The lungs and trachea
were removed en bloc, suspended in 4-ml distilled water, and homogenized
through a stainless steel sieve with 100-lm holes. We counted intact spores on
a hemocytometer under a light microscope at 3200 magnification. To calculate
the number of spores in the lungs (SL), we multiplied the total volume (VH) of
homogenized lungs (4000 ll) by the number of visible spores counted (SC) in
the hemocytometer grids then divided by the volume of one hemocytometer
grid (VG) (0.9 ll) multiplied by the total number (N) of grids counted (between
4 and 10 per mouse). We used the equation SL ¼ VH ðSCÞVGðNÞ :
For radioactivity measurements, mice were humanely killed as described
above at 5 min, 8 h, and 1, 2, and 7 days after spore instillation. The lungs and
trachea, stomach, cecum, and large intestine were removed and placed into
preweighed scintillation vials. The small intestines were removed and cut into
pieces and distributed among scintillation vials. Vials were reweighed and
tissue weights calculated.
Tissues were dissolved in 1.0 ml Solvable (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and
0.1 ml of 100 mM EDTA, followed by 0.3 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide. The
caps were kept loose for 15 min to allow gas to escape. Caps were tightened,
and the vials were incubated in a 60C water bath for 1 h. The tubes were
cooled to room temperature, and 15 ml of Ultima Gold (Perkin Elmer) was
added. Samples were read in a Wallac Oy WinSpectral Scintillation Counter
(Turku, Finland) using the 3H/14C dual label program. The radioactivity
detected in the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and cecum was totaled
for each mouse to determine the total radioactivity in the GI tract.
In Vitro spore cytotoxicity. Four BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were
lavaged for each of the three data points, as described previously (Rosenblum
Lichtenstein et al., 2006). We did a 1-ml wash, followed by eleven 0.75-ml
washes with D-PBS. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was pooled, resulting in
one tube for each mouse strain. Seven different experiments were performed to
achieve a sample size of 3 per time point. BSA (30%) (Calbiochem, La Jolla,
CA) was preadded to the ice-chilled Falcon tube at 30 ll/mouse (~9 ml of
lavage fluid was recovered per mouse) to enhance cell survival. The cell
suspensions were centrifuged at 200 3 g for 15 min and the supernatants
discarded. The cells were resuspended in 1-ml red blood cell lysis solution
(Metcalf et al., 1986) and held at room temperature for 10 min. Supplemented
RPMI-1640 was prepared with the following: 13 Cell-Gro RPMI-1640 with
L-glutamine (Mediatech Inc.), 1% penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin
100 lg/ml (1003) (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and 10% fetal bovine serum,
standard (HyClone, Logan, UT). Five microliters of supplemented RPMI-1640
was added to the cells which were then centrifuged at 200 3 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of
supplemented RPMI-1640. The cells were counted on a hemocytometer and
diluted to 750,000 cells/ml. One hundred microliters of the cell suspension was
pipetted into each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner bio-one lclear plates), and
the strains were alternated from well to well. Plates were incubated at 37C
with 5% CO2 overnight to allow the AMs to attach. Washes in subsequent steps
are intended to remove nonadherent cell populations (such as neutrophils) that
we have previously shown to be less than 3% of the white cell population in
lung lavage fluid in healthy mice (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). Two to
three replicates of each pool were used for each spore dose and time point in
each of seven experiments, including three dose-response and four time course
experiments. Every data point shown is based on two to three replicates from
three to seven different experiments for a total of 6-15 wells per data point.
Spore suspensions were prepared in supplemented RPMI-1640 for each
experiment. The spores were diluted to 250,000 spores/ml using a 
hemocytometer. Spores were serially diluted 1:5 in supplemented RPMI-1640, resulting in
concentrations of 5000, 1000, 200, and 40 spores per 75,000 macrophages for
the dose-response experiments. A dose of 1000 spores per 75,000 macrophages
was used for the time course protocols. In all cases, a negative control sample
was prepared that contained media without spores.
After overnight recovery from plating, the media was removed and 100 ll of
spore preparations or control media were added to each well. Plates were
incubated at 37C in air with 5% CO2 for 24 h for the dose response and for
2, 5, or 24 h for the time course experiments.
At each designated time, the cells were washed twice with 300 ll of D-PBS
with calcium and magnesium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA). A 20-ml solution with
LUNG RESPONSES TO S. CHARTARUM TOXINS
115
5 ll of ethidium homodimer 1 (EthD1, Invitrogen LIVE/DEAD Viability/
Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells, Eugene, OR) and 5 ll of calcein AM
(Invitrogen LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells) was
prepared and 200 ll was added to each well. The cells were stained for
30-45 min at room temperature before examination by microscopic imaging.
Cell treatments with Stachybotrys chartarum spore toxin and SG. We
assessed whether a water soluble extract from S. chartarum spores would
demonstrate comparable cytotoxicity differences as intact spores. 
Stachybo-trys chartarum spore toxin (SST) was prepared by adding ~1.5 3 107 spores
grown as described earlier to 15 ml of D-PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
Spores were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was filtered through
a 0.1-lm low-protein binding filter. Serial dilutions of SST (solution B, 26 ±
3 lg SG/ml; Fig. 1B) at 1:50 (528 ng SG/ml), 1:100 (264 ng SG/ml), 1:500
(53 ng SG/ml), 1:2500 (10 ng SG/ml), 1:12,500 (2 ng SG/ml), and saline
controls in supplemented RPMI-1640 were added to 75,000 cells per well, as
described above. Cells were also treated with SG isolated and purified from
S. chartarum cultures (Islam, 2009). SG (100,000 ng) was reconstituted in 7 ml
of saline and then diluted into supplemented RPMI-1640 at dilutions of
1:10 (1428 ng/ml), 1:20 (714 ng/ml), 1:100 (143 ng/ml), 1:500 (29 ng/ml),

All toxin treatments were for 24 h, and cells were stained as described above.
Cell viability analysis. The cells were imaged on a BD Pathway 855

emission was collected from the bottom of the plate using a field size of ~300 lm2

3 2 binning of pixels to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Sequential confocal
images of calcein AM and EthD1 fluorescence were collected every 1.7 lm.
Segmentation was used to draw regions around each cell as defined by
a fluorescent signal. The regions of interest (ROIs) for both calcein AM and
EthD1 were analyzed using BD Attovision software. We optimized the settings to
maximize the number of cells counted whereas minimizing the numbers of cells
counted twice. The ROI numbers for each of three fields for each well were
summed. The percent live cells were calculated by taking the number of calcein
positive cells in each well and dividing by the mean of the sums of the number of
calcein AM positive and EthD1 positive cells in the zero spores control wells.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software (Version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data displayed

on a logarithmic scale were log transformed for statistical analyses. For the
visual counting of spores in lung homogenates, ANOVA was performed. For
the experiments measuring radiolabeled spore clearance from the lung, we used
a repeated measures analysis that accounts for both the 3H and 14C labels for
each mouse. For the experiments measuring radioactivity in the GI tract,
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data to
account for the use of two different isotopes and our examining multiple
tissues. For in vitro cytotoxicity experiments, we used a repeated measures
analysis that allows for residual correlation among observations derived from
the same BAL pool to account for differences among pools and spore
preparations. In the dose-response model, we utilized a broken stick analysis to
describe the change in the slopes of both lines at the 200 spores per well dose.
A broken stick analysis allows us to describe two of the expected linear regions
in a typical dose-response S-curve (Ruppert et al., 2003). In this instance, we
have a relatively flat region at doses too low to cause significant cell death and
a steeper region where increasing dose causes an approximately linear increase
in cell death when the data are graphed on a log-log scale.

We investigated differences in the pulmonary and systemic
clearance of Stachybotrys chartarum spores in two strains of mice,
BALB/c and C57BL/6J. To evaluate clearance, mice were 
intratracheally instilled with a suspension of radiolabeled S. chartarum
spores or with unlabeled spores. The lungs of C57BL/6J mice
showed more rapid spore clearance than the lungs of BALB/c
mice, which correlated with increased levels of spore-associated
radioactivity in the GI tracts of C57BL/6J as compared with
BALB/c mice. To identify mechanisms responsible for mouse
strain differences in spore clearance and previously described lung
inflammatory responses, we exposed alveolar macrophages (AMs)
lavaged from BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice to S. chartarum spores,
S. chartarum spore toxin (SST), and satratoxin G (SG) in vitro.
The S. chartarum spores were found to be highly toxic with most
cells from either mouse strain being killed within 24 h when
exposed to a spore:cell ratio of 1:75. The spores were more lethal
to AMs from C57BL/6J than those from BALB/c mice. In mice,
the SST elicited many of the same inflammatory responses as the
spores in vivo, including AM recruitment, pulmonary hemorrhage,
and cytokine production. Our data suggest that differences in
pulmonary spore clearance may contribute to the differences in
pulmonary responses to S. chartarum between BALB/c and
C57BL/6J mice. Enhanced AM survival and subsequent 
macro-phage-mediated inflammation may also contribute to the higher
susceptibility of BALB/c mice to S. chartarum pulmonary effects.
Analogous genetic differences among humans may contribute to
reported variable sensitivity to S. chartarum.

multiple symptoms, including muscle aches, headaches, cough,
pulmonary hemorrhage, dermatitis, and interstitial lung disease
(Cooley et al., 1998). Infant deaths from acute idiopathic
pulmonary hemorrhage have been hypothesized to be caused in
part by this fungus (Dearborn et al., 1999; Etzel et al., 1998).
Responsiveness to S. chartarum is idiosyncratic; some humans
respond, others do not. Because separating environmental from
genetic effects is difficult in humans, we used a mouse model
(Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006) and an in vitro cell assay
to elucidate mechanisms of responses to S. chartarum and to
clarify the importance of strain differences that reflect genetic
components of host responses.
Stachybotrys chartarum grows well at room temperature on
wet surfaces composed of cellulose-containing materials such
as paper, ceiling tiles, and cardboard (Murtoniemi et al., 2003).
With appropriate temperature, light, and relative humidity, it
produces mycotoxins, including macrocyclic trichothecenes
such as satratoxin G (SG), which inhibit protein and DNA
synthesis, induce protein degradation, disrupt cellular function,
and cause cellular injury and inflammation (Bae et al., 2009;
Hastings et al., 2005; Hudson et al., 2005; Kankkunen et al.,
2009; McCrae et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Yike et al., 2007).
The fungus also releases stachylysin that can lead to pulmonary
hemorrhage (Vesper SJ and Vesper MJ, 2002).
Previous experiments used exposures of rats and mice to
S. chartarum spores intranasally and intratracheally; lung tissue
was examined for histological changes and bronchoalveolar
lavage for evidence of injury and inflammation (Nikulin et al.,
1996, 1997; Rao et al., 2000; Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006). Stachybotrys chartarum has been consistently reported
to cause pulmonary hemorrhage and extensive inflammation as
well as apoptosis, cytokine release, DNA damage, and changes
in gene expression (Bae et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2003b;
Dearborn et al., 1999; Islam et al., 2006, 2008; Penttinen et al.,
114
2007; Rand et al., 2002, 2003; Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006; Wang and Yadav, 2006, 2007). In addition to
mycotoxins, S. chartarum releases SchS34, a 34-kD antigen
(Rand and Miller, 2008).
We have previously shown that BALB/c mice respond more
to pulmonary exposure to S. chartarum spores than do C57BL/
6J or C3H/HeJ mice (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006).
Lungs from exposed BALB/c mice showed the most
hemorrhage, the highest permeability of the air-blood barrier,
the most white blood cell recruitment, and the highest
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in response to
intratracheally instilled spores of S. chartarum. Our data also
show that mice have dose-dependent pulmonary responses to
S. chartarum and that their genetic background affects the
slope of these dose-response curves.
We wanted to know whether strain differences influence
clearance kinetics of spores. BALB/c mice clear both Bacillus
anthracis and Cryptococcus neoformans from the lungs more
efficiently than do C57BL/6J mice (Decken et al., 1998; Lyons
et al., 2004). The mucociliary escalator and macrophage
activity play important roles in the pulmonary clearance of
pathogens in the lungs; multiple environmental factors
modulate this role.
In this study, we sought to clarify the roles of pulmonary
clearance and macrophage cytotoxicity in modulating
responses to S. chartarum. We hypothesized that the observed
strain differences in S. chartarum responsiveness are mediated
in part by different rates of pulmonary spore clearance. The two
mouse strains we employed here, C57BL/6J and BALB/c, are
inbred strains developed independently and differ from each
other at over 50% of characterized genetic loci (Taconic,
1998a,b). Both strains are TLR2þ and TLR4þ (Matsuguchi
et al., 2003; Poltorak et al., 1998). BALB/c mice have been
shown to be Th2 dominant, whereas C57BL/6 mice are Th1
dominant as summarized by Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.
(2006). Because alveolar macrophages (AMs) from C57BL/6
mice have been shown to have a higher phagocytic capacity
than AMs from BALB/c mice (Su et al., 2001), we
hypothesized that C57BL/6J mice might clear spores more
efficiently than BALB/c mice, leading to differences in
integrated spore dose over time. This may contribute to the
increased pulmonary inflammation seen in BALB/c as
compared with C57BL/6J mice. We also hypothesized that
differences in AM sensitivity to S. chartarum-induced
cytotoxicity influence both inflammation and spore clearance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal strains and spore suspensions. A trichothecene-producing strain
of S. chartarum was obtained from Harriet Burge (Environmental 
Microbiology Lab, San Bruno, CA) (Rao et al., 2000) and grown on potato dextrose agar
(PDA) plates at 15C. Spores were vacuumed from the surface of 21-day agar
cultures using a modified filter cassette with a 37-mm, 0.4-lm polycarbonate
ROSENBLUM LICHTENSTEIN ET AL.
membrane filter (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA). After the spores were
removed from the filter, they were suspended in D-PBS (Mediatech Inc.,
Herndon, VA) at the desired concentration, as measured under light microscopy
at 3200 in a hemocytometer chamber. Minor hyphal fragment content and
negligible spore clumping were observed; most spores were ovoid in shape
with a mean size of 6 3 9 lm. Two Stachybotrys chemotypes have been
described-an atranone-producing chemotype and a trichothecenes-producing
chemotype (Andersen et al., 2002, 2003; Rand et al., 2006). The S. chartarum
strain described in this study is a trichothecene-producing chemotype.
SG ELISA. SG levels in the spore suspension were measured by a modified
competitive direct ELISA (Chung et al., 2003a). Briefly, SG antibody was diluted
in PBS (1:10,000), coated on microtiter plates (100 ll/well), and incubated
overnight at 4C. Plates were washed and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS at 25C for 1 h. SG standards (0-500 ng/ml) were made,
and SG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was diluted (1:4000 [v/v]) in 1% (w/v)
BSA in PBS. Equal volumes of diluted SG horseradish peroxidase conjugate
(50 ll) and standards diluted similarly were then mixed and incubated in
microtiter plates at 25C for 1 h. Plates were washed, and bound peroxidase was
determined by 100 ll/well incubation with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine
(Neogen, Lansing, MI) at 25C for 0.5 h. Color reaction was stopped with 2N
sulfuric acid (100 ll/well), and plates were read at 450 nm wavelength on ELISA
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). SG concentrations in samples
were determined from the standard curve using Softmax software (Molecular
Devices).
Dual radiolabeled spores. Stachybotrys chartarum spores were streaked
onto PDA plates supplemented with 1 ml of D-[U-14C] glucose (287 mCi/
mmol, 200 lCi/ml; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and 1 ml of
[6-3H] thymidine (23 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Growth conditions and harvesting were as described above. The dual label
enabled tracing of both spore DNA and carbohydrate components such as the
cell wall and glycosylated proteins. Spores were washed with saline four times
prior to use to remove any unincorporated radiolabel. After the fourth wash, no
radiolabel was detectable in the wash fluid.
Animal care. Animal use protocols for these experiments were approved
by the committee on animal experiments, and all institutional and federal
guidelines on animal care and handling were followed. Male BALB/c (Taconic,
Germantown, NY) and C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
were housed at the Harvard Animal Facilities for a minimum 1-week
acclimation period, fed Purina Mouse Chow and water ad libitum, and kept
on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All mice in these experiments were age matched
(7-10 weeks). All experiments described below were performed on both mouse
strains concurrently.
In Vivo spore clearance. Spores suspensions were delivered into the lungs
of both mouse strains by intratracheal instillation (IT) at 7.5 ± 1 weeks. Each
mouse received 6.25 3 105 (a concentration of 107 spores/ml saline in 62.5 ll
saline) spores per 25-g body weight for the quantitative clearance experiments
(visual counting) and 6.25 3 104 spores per mouse (not adjusted for body
weight) for the radiolabeled clearance experiments. We used the same volume
for all the animals in the experiments to standardize the administered
radioactive dose from day to day.
Between six and twelve mice per day were administered spores. On each
day, the order of the strains was randomly alternated. At least three animals for
each strain and time were sacrificed, and organs were harvested. The amount of
radioactivity in the delivered dose was quantified by delivering an equivalent
quantity of spore suspension to a vial (n ¼ 4) for digestion (see below) and
subsequent counting of radioactivity.
Immediately after the spore instillation and 24 h later, the mice were
humanely killed by an intraperitoneal lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital
(Anthony Products Co., Arcadia, CA) (10 mg/mouse). Mice were then
exsanguinated by cutting the abdominal aorta and by puncturing the
hemidiaphragm to create a bilateral pneumothorax. The lungs and trachea
were removed en bloc, suspended in 4-ml distilled water, and homogenized
through a stainless steel sieve with 100-lm holes. We counted intact spores on
a hemocytometer under a light microscope at 3200 magnification. To calculate
the number of spores in the lungs (SL), we multiplied the total volume (VH) of
homogenized lungs (4000 ll) by the number of visible spores counted (SC) in
the hemocytometer grids then divided by the volume of one hemocytometer
grid (VG) (0.9 ll) multiplied by the total number (N) of grids counted (between
4 and 10 per mouse). We used the equation SL ¼ VH ðSCÞVGðNÞ :
For radioactivity measurements, mice were humanely killed as described
above at 5 min, 8 h, and 1, 2, and 7 days after spore instillation. The lungs and
trachea, stomach, cecum, and large intestine were removed and placed into
preweighed scintillation vials. The small intestines were removed and cut into
pieces and distributed among scintillation vials. Vials were reweighed and
tissue weights calculated.
Tissues were dissolved in 1.0 ml Solvable (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and
0.1 ml of 100 mM EDTA, followed by 0.3 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide. The
caps were kept loose for 15 min to allow gas to escape. Caps were tightened,
and the vials were incubated in a 60C water bath for 1 h. The tubes were
cooled to room temperature, and 15 ml of Ultima Gold (Perkin Elmer) was
added. Samples were read in a Wallac Oy WinSpectral Scintillation Counter
(Turku, Finland) using the 3H/14C dual label program. The radioactivity
detected in the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and cecum was totaled
for each mouse to determine the total radioactivity in the GI tract.
In Vitro spore cytotoxicity. Four BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were
lavaged for each of the three data points, as described previously (Rosenblum
Lichtenstein et al., 2006). We did a 1-ml wash, followed by eleven 0.75-ml
washes with D-PBS. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was pooled, resulting in
one tube for each mouse strain. Seven different experiments were performed to
achieve a sample size of 3 per time point. BSA (30%) (Calbiochem, La Jolla,
CA) was preadded to the ice-chilled Falcon tube at 30 ll/mouse (~9 ml of
lavage fluid was recovered per mouse) to enhance cell survival. The cell
suspensions were centrifuged at 200 3 g for 15 min and the supernatants
discarded. The cells were resuspended in 1-ml red blood cell lysis solution
(Metcalf et al., 1986) and held at room temperature for 10 min. Supplemented
RPMI-1640 was prepared with the following: 13 Cell-Gro RPMI-1640 with
L-glutamine (Mediatech Inc.), 1% penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin
100 lg/ml (1003) (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and 10% fetal bovine serum,
standard (HyClone, Logan, UT). Five microliters of supplemented RPMI-1640
was added to the cells which were then centrifuged at 200 3 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of
supplemented RPMI-1640. The cells were counted on a hemocytometer and
diluted to 750,000 cells/ml. One hundred microliters of the cell suspension was
pipetted into each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner bio-one lclear plates), and
the strains were alternated from well to well. Plates were incubated at 37C
with 5% CO2 overnight to allow the AMs to attach. Washes in subsequent steps
are intended to remove nonadherent cell populations (such as neutrophils) that
we have previously shown to be less than 3% of the white cell population in
lung lavage fluid in healthy mice (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). Two to
three replicates of each pool were used for each spore dose and time point in
each of seven experiments, including three dose-response and four time course
experiments. Every data point shown is based on two to three replicates from
three to seven different experiments for a total of 6-15 wells per data point.
Spore suspensions were prepared in supplemented RPMI-1640 for each
experiment. The spores were diluted to 250,000 spores/ml using a 
hemocytometer. Spores were serially diluted 1:5 in supplemented RPMI-1640, resulting in
concentrations of 5000, 1000, 200, and 40 spores per 75,000 macrophages for
the dose-response experiments. A dose of 1000 spores per 75,000 macrophages
was used for the time course protocols. In all cases, a negative control sample
was prepared that contained media without spores.
After overnight recovery from plating, the media was removed and 100 ll of
spore preparations or control media were added to each well. Plates were
incubated at 37C in air with 5% CO2 for 24 h for the dose response and for
2, 5, or 24 h for the time course experiments.
At each designated time, the cells were washed twice with 300 ll of D-PBS
with calcium and magnesium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA). A 20-ml solution with

5 ll of ethidium homodimer 1 (EthD1, Invitrogen LIVE/DEAD Viability/
Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells, Eugene, OR) and 5 ll of calcein AM
(Invitrogen LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells) was
prepared and 200 ll was added to each well. The cells were stained for
30-45 min at room temperature before examination by microscopic imaging.
Cell treatments with Stachybotrys chartarum spore toxin and SG. We
assessed whether a water soluble extract from S. chartarum spores would
demonstrate comparable cytotoxicity differences as intact spores. 
Stachybo-trys chartarum spore toxin (SST) was prepared by adding ~1.5 3 107 spores
grown as described earlier to 15 ml of D-PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
Spores were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was filtered through
a 0.1-lm low-protein binding filter. Serial dilutions of SST (solution B, 26 ±
3 lg SG/ml; Fig. 1B) at 1:50 (528 ng SG/ml), 1:100 (264 ng SG/ml), 1:500
(53 ng SG/ml), 1:2500 (10 ng SG/ml), 1:12,500 (2 ng SG/ml), and saline
controls in supplemented RPMI-1640 were added to 75,000 cells per well, as
described above. Cells were also treated with SG isolated and purified from
S. chartarum cultures (Islam, 2009). SG (100,000 ng) was reconstituted in 7 ml
of saline and then diluted into supplemented RPMI-1640 at dilutions of
1:10 (1428 ng/ml), 1:20 (714 ng/ml), 1:100 (143 ng/ml), 1:500 (29 ng/ml),
1:2500 (5.7 ng/ml), 1:12,500 (1.1 ng/ml), media only, and saline controls.
All toxin treatments were for 24 h, and cells were stained as described above.
Cell viability analysis. The cells were imaged on a BD Pathway 855
Bioimager at 2003 magnification. Cells were illuminated, and fluorescence
emission was collected from the bottom of the plate using a field size of ~300 lm2
and three fields per well. All images were collected using flat field correction and 2
3 2 binning of pixels to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Sequential confocal
images of calcein AM and EthD1 fluorescence were collected every 1.7 lm.
Segmentation was used to draw regions around each cell as defined by
a fluorescent signal. The regions of interest (ROIs) for both calcein AM and
EthD1 were analyzed using BD Attovision software. We optimized the settings to
maximize the number of cells counted whereas minimizing the numbers of cells
counted twice. The ROI numbers for each of three fields for each well were
summed. The percent live cells were calculated by taking the number of calcein
positive cells in each well and dividing by the mean of the sums of the number of
calcein AM positive and EthD1 positive cells in the zero spores control wells.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software (Version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data displayed
116
on a logarithmic scale were log transformed for statistical analyses. For the
visual counting of spores in lung homogenates, ANOVA was performed. For
the experiments measuring radiolabeled spore clearance from the lung, we used
a repeated measures analysis that accounts for both the 3H and 14C labels for
each mouse. For the experiments measuring radioactivity in the GI tract,
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data to

A broken stick analysis allows us to describe two of the expected linear regions

have a relatively flat region at doses too low to cause significant cell death and
a steeper region where increasing dose causes an approximately linear increase

C57BL/6J AMs died at spore doses as low as 1000 spores per
well with 75,000 cells (p ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 5A). Many of the dead
cells showed a punctate nuclear morphology in their staining
with EthD1 consistent with apoptosis. At 24 h after spore
addition, for doses less than 200 spores per 75,000 
macrophages, the log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 2.29 - 0.20 (log(dose)) and
log(yBALB/c) ¼ 2.04 - 0.06 (log(dose)), where y represents the
percent of live cells and dose represents the number of spores
per well. For doses greater than 200 spores per 75,000 
macrophages, the log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 4.04 - 0.97 (log(dose)) and
log(yBALB/c) ¼ 3.4731 - 0.68 (log(dose)), where y represents
the percent of live cells and dose represents the number
of spores per 75,000 macrophages. At doses higher than
200 spores/well, the slopes are significantly different
(p ¼ 0.007) between the two mouse strains.
C57BL/6J AMs died more rapidly in response to S. chartarum
than do BALB/c AMs. The equations describing their cell death
after addition of 1000 spores are log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 1.87 - 0.098
(time) and log(yBALB/c) ¼ 1.84 - 0.086 (time), where y is the
percent of live cells and time is the amount of time after spore
addition in hours. The slopes of these two lines are significantly
different (p ¼ 0.04). This strain difference is consistent with
C57BL/6J mice producing significantly lower levels of 
inflammatory cytokines in vivo (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006).
SST and SG Kill More AMs from C57BL/6J than BALB/c
Increasing doses of SST cause increased cytotoxicity in AMs
from both mouse strains (p ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 6A). This is also
true for SG only (p ¼ 0.0001), (Fig. 6B). However, we
observed a range of low concentrations where little change is
seen, but at higher concentrations there is a linear relationship
when percent survival is plotted against concentration.
Importantly, we show that SG, although having significant
cytotoxicity, does not account for all the cytotoxicity of SST.
Thus, SG is a significant component, but there are also others.
The concentration that is lethal for 25% of the cells (LC25) for
SST for C57BL/6J is 0.017 lg/ml SG equivalents and for
BALB/c is 0.052 lg/ml SG equivalents. The LC25 for SG for
C57BL/6J is 0.075 lg/ml and for BALB/c is 0.243 lg/ml. We
used LC25 rather than LC50 because LC50 is outside the known
linear range of our data for SG in BALB/c macrophages. Based
on these numbers, SG accounts for ~20 to 25% of the toxicity
of the SST.
After 1 day of treatment with SST, more C57BL/6J AMs die
than BALB/c AMs at doses between 0.01 and 0.5 lg SG
equivalents/ml (p ¼ 0.02). The slopes between those doses are
-0.41 and -0.23 for C57BL/6J and BALB/c, respectively
(Fig. 6A). Similarly, after 1 day of treatment with SG, more
C57BL/6J AMs die than BALB/c AMs at doses between
0.03 and 0.7 lg SG/ml (p ¼ 0.059). The slopes between those
doses are -0.27 and -0.18 for C57BL/6J and BALB/c,
respectively (Fig. 6B). The two mouse strains showed 
differ-(A) Dose (SST [lg/ml SG equivalents]) verses live cells as a percent of baseline
(baselines are calculated as the total number of cells in matched wells with

different from BALB/c (-0.18).
ences in sensitivity to both SST and SG, with SG accounting for
15-30% of the cytotoxicity of SST at the calculated LD50.
DISCUSSION
C57BL/6J mice cleared trichothecene-producing S. 
chartarum spores from their lungs at a faster rate than did BALB/c
mice. When spores are delivered to the lungs of C57BL/6J
mice, more of the spores were cleared via the mucociliary
escalator and then swallowed and excreted through the GI tract
than in BALB/c mice. Others may be degraded by 
macrophages within the lungs. This more efficient clearance in
C57BL/6J mice via innate mechanisms may partially explain
the diminished pulmonary injury and inflammation that have
been reported in this strain (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006). In contrast, spores or spore components in the lungs of
BALB/c mice persisted longer and thus may have elicited
a greater response. For example, 37 ± 1% of the carbohydrate
component of the spores persisted in the lungs of BALB/c mice
a week after instillation, whereas only 17 ± 5% remained in the
lungs of C57BL/6J mice. This persistence might also explain
how an extract of S. chartarum can also induce allergic asthma
in BALB/c mice after repeated pulmonary exposures (Viana
et al., 2002). The carbohydrate component of the labeled
spores most likely includes mycotoxins and glycosylated
proteins that may be causing some of the inflammatory
responses. Some of the remaining 14C label may also reflect
metabolites of spores, mycotoxins, or proteins. C57BL/6J mice
may metabolize spores or their mycotoxins more rapidly, and
this may in part mediate the increased clearance rate in the
C57/BL6J mice. Whichever spore components the 14C label
represents, the additional spore-derived material remaining in
the BALB/c mouse lungs over time is most likely mediating
the increased inflammation observed in those lungs.
We reported that strain differences in response to
S. chartarum are distinct from the strain differences seen in
response to lipopolysaccharide or to other fungi (Rosenblum
Lichtenstein et al., 2006). C57BL/6J is the least responsive
strain to S. chartarum and BALB/c is the most responsive, as
indicated by both cellular and cytokine changes in lung lavage
fluid (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). The nature of these
strain differences seems to be unique to S. chartarum.
Pulmonary exposure to Coccidioides immitis, C. neoformans,
and Aspergillus fumigatus show that C57BL/6 mice are more
sensitive to infection and inflammation and that BALB/c are
more resistant (Cox et al., 1988; Hoag et al., 1995; 
Stephens-Romero et al., 2005; Zaragoza et al., 2007). Moreover, murine
endotoxin susceptibility also shows a different pattern of strain
responsiveness (Wells et al., 2003). Stachybotrys chartarum is
the only fungus that we know of to which BALB/c mice are
more sensitive than C57BL/6J mice.
It has been reported that C57BL/6J are generally poor at
clearing other types of mold, such as Histoplasma capsulatum,
B. anthracis, Coccidioides posadasii, and A. fumigatus, which
in part explains their increased susceptibility to these molds
(Ehrchen et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2004; Stephens-Romero
et al., 2005; Wu-Hsieh, 1989). In contrast, we showed that
C57BL/6J mice may use bulk transport out of the lungs via the
mucociliary escalator as a first step toward efficient clearance
of the spores and their constituents from the lungs. BALB/c
mice, on the other hand, may retain more spores in the lungs,
which more effectively induces cytokine release, cascades of
cytokine effects, and infiltration of neutrophils.
C57BL/6J AMs also have significantly increased cell death
compared with BALB/c. Increased AM death may lead to less
cytokine release because dead cells cannot release inflammatory
mediators. This results in less pulmonary injury and 
inflammation as measured in bronchoalveolar lavage parameters.
Similarly, macrophage apoptosis, which appears to be
a contributing mechanism for cell death, has been reported to
aid in microbial killing, to downregulate the inflammatory
response, and even to aid in pulmonary clearance in
pneumococcal and streptococcal models (Dockrell et al.,
2003; Marriott and Dockrell, 2006; Marriott et al., 2006). If
the greater rate of cell death in AMs from C57BL/6J mice is
attributable to apoptosis, then the C57BL/6J mice might be
LUNG RESPONSES TO S. CHARTARUM TOXINS
expected to have less pulmonary inflammation and better
clearance, a scenario compatible with our results. In addition,
in a C. neoformans model, depletion of AMs was shown to be
protective against infection (Kechichian et al., 2007).
These two mechanisms in which cell death leads to less
inflammation may interact. For example, we showed that
BALB/c mice have focal inflammation consisting primarily of
AMs after administration of S. chartarum into the lungs
(Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). This focal inflammation
may have blocked some of the mouse’s airways and might
physically impede clearance of the spores that caused the initial
inflammation.
SG accounts for 15-30% of the toxicity of SST. Other
trichothecenes, proteins, and mycotoxins may account for the
remainder of the cytotoxicity. In addition, various mycotoxins
may act synergistically to account for the toxicity of SST. The
significant dose response to SG and SST in AMs from both mouse
strains suggests that SG accounts for a significant amount of the
cytotoxicity of S. chartarum.
Genetic variation in the human population that leads to
decreased rates of AM apoptosis in the presence of
S. chartarum could lead to increased spore-induced cytokine
release, increased inflammation, decreased spore clearance, and
ultimately to a higher pulmonary spore exposure over time,
exacerbating the effects of spore exposure. Small differences in
rates of apoptosis could be magnified by downstream effects
leading to greater differences in response to S. chartarum
exposure. In addition, it has been hypothesized that exposure to
cigarette smoke might make infants more susceptible to acute
idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage (Etzel et al., 1998). 
Interestingly, it has been reported that cigarette smoke exposure
inhibits the natural activity of the mucociliary escalator (Cohen
et al., 1979). Such an environmental cause of reduced
clearance might further exacerbate pulmonary hemorrhage in
an already susceptible infant.
Through this and previous work, we have demonstrated that
different mouse strains respond differently to S. chartarum. We
interpret the data as showing that both reduced clearance of and
higher macrophage cytotoxicity from the bioactive components
of S. chartarum in humans might cause similar differences in
susceptibility among the human population. The results from
this study are the first evidence that differences in spore
clearance and macrophage susceptibility to spore-induced
death may contribute to strain differences in susceptibility to
S. chartarum seen in vivo. That these differences have a genetic
basis is not unlikely.
A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report concluded that S.
chartarum was responsible for acute idiopathic pulmonary
hemorrhage in a cluster of infants (Dearborn et al., 1999; Etzel
et al., 1998), although there may have been other contributing
factors such as environmental tobacco smoke or consequences
of water damage including bacterial exposures (Dearborn et al.,
1999). The original CDC report and a later case study suggested
that African-American babies were more likely than Caucasian
119
120
babies to die of acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage after
exposure to S. chartarum (Dearborn et al., 1999, 2002; Etzel
et al., 1998). It is unclear if the observed ethnic differences were
because of choice of controls or to economic or other
environmental factors that are correlates of race, genetic
differences, or a combination of both.
Genetic variability in human populations may account for
some of the wide variation among individuals responding to
mold exposure in contaminated occupational and domestic
settings. In addition, other concomitant conditions, such as
cigarette smoke exposure or bacterial infection, might further
exacerbate poor spore clearance in susceptible populations.
Future directions include determination of the genetic loci
responsible for differential clearance of S. chartarum and their
interactions with environmental factors. It would be of further
interest to test the effects of cigarette smoke or concomitant
exposure to other pathogens on spore clearance.

DISCUSSION
C57BL/6J mice cleared trichothecene-producing S. 
chartarum spores from their lungs at a faster rate than did BALB/c
mice. When spores are delivered to the lungs of C57BL/6J
mice, more of the spores were cleared via the mucociliary
escalator and then swallowed and excreted through the GI tract
than in BALB/c mice. Others may be degraded by 
macrophages within the lungs. This more efficient clearance in
C57BL/6J mice via innate mechanisms may partially explain
the diminished pulmonary injury and inflammation that have
been reported in this strain (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006). In contrast, spores or spore components in the lungs of
BALB/c mice persisted longer and thus may have elicited
a greater response. For example, 37 ± 1% of the carbohydrate
component of the spores persisted in the lungs of BALB/c mice
a week after instillation, whereas only 17 ± 5% remained in the
lungs of C57BL/6J mice. This persistence might also explain
how an extract of S. chartarum can also induce allergic asthma
in BALB/c mice after repeated pulmonary exposures (Viana
et al., 2002). The carbohydrate component of the labeled
spores most likely includes mycotoxins and glycosylated
proteins that may be causing some of the inflammatory
responses. Some of the remaining 14C label may also reflect
metabolites of spores, mycotoxins, or proteins. C57BL/6J mice
may metabolize spores or their mycotoxins more rapidly, and
this may in part mediate the increased clearance rate in the
C57/BL6J mice. Whichever spore components the 14C label
represents, the additional spore-derived material remaining in
the BALB/c mouse lungs over time is most likely mediating
the increased inflammation observed in those lungs.
We reported that strain differences in response to
S. chartarum are distinct from the strain differences seen in
response to lipopolysaccharide or to other fungi (Rosenblum
Lichtenstein et al., 2006). C57BL/6J is the least responsive
strain to S. chartarum and BALB/c is the most responsive, as
indicated by both cellular and cytokine changes in lung lavage
fluid (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). The nature of these
strain differences seems to be unique to S. chartarum.
Pulmonary exposure to Coccidioides immitis, C. neoformans,
and Aspergillus fumigatus show that C57BL/6 mice are more
sensitive to infection and inflammation and that BALB/c are
more resistant (Cox et al., 1988; Hoag et al., 1995; 
Stephens-Romero et al., 2005; Zaragoza et al., 2007). Moreover, murine
endotoxin susceptibility also shows a different pattern of strain
responsiveness (Wells et al., 2003). Stachybotrys chartarum is
the only fungus that we know of to which BALB/c mice are
more sensitive than C57BL/6J mice.
It has been reported that C57BL/6J are generally poor at
clearing other types of mold, such as Histoplasma capsulatum,
B. anthracis, Coccidioides posadasii, and A. fumigatus, which
in part explains their increased susceptibility to these molds
(Ehrchen et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2004; Stephens-Romero
et al., 2005; Wu-Hsieh, 1989). In contrast, we showed that
C57BL/6J mice may use bulk transport out of the lungs via the
mucociliary escalator as a first step toward efficient clearance
of the spores and their constituents from the lungs. BALB/c
mice, on the other hand, may retain more spores in the lungs,
which more effectively induces cytokine release, cascades of
cytokine effects, and infiltration of neutrophils.
C57BL/6J AMs also have significantly increased cell death
compared with BALB/c. Increased AM death may lead to less
cytokine release because dead cells cannot release inflammatory
mediators. This results in less pulmonary injury and 
inflammation as measured in bronchoalveolar lavage parameters.
Similarly, macrophage apoptosis, which appears to be
a contributing mechanism for cell death, has been reported to
aid in microbial killing, to downregulate the inflammatory
response, and even to aid in pulmonary clearance in
pneumococcal and streptococcal models (Dockrell et al.,
2003; Marriott and Dockrell, 2006; Marriott et al., 2006). If
the greater rate of cell death in AMs from C57BL/6J mice is
attributable to apoptosis, then the C57BL/6J mice might be
LUNG RESPONSES TO S. CHARTARUM TOXINS
expected to have less pulmonary inflammation and better
clearance, a scenario compatible with our results. In addition,
in a C. neoformans model, depletion of AMs was shown to be
protective against infection (Kechichian et al., 2007).
These two mechanisms in which cell death leads to less
inflammation may interact. For example, we showed that
BALB/c mice have focal inflammation consisting primarily of
AMs after administration of S. chartarum into the lungs
(Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006). This focal inflammation
may have blocked some of the mouse’s airways and might
physically impede clearance of the spores that caused the initial
inflammation.
SG accounts for 15-30% of the toxicity of SST. Other
trichothecenes, proteins, and mycotoxins may account for the
remainder of the cytotoxicity. In addition, various mycotoxins
may act synergistically to account for the toxicity of SST. The
significant dose response to SG and SST in AMs from both mouse
strains suggests that SG accounts for a significant amount of the
cytotoxicity of S. chartarum.
Genetic variation in the human population that leads to
decreased rates of AM apoptosis in the presence of
S. chartarum could lead to increased spore-induced cytokine
release, increased inflammation, decreased spore clearance, and
ultimately to a higher pulmonary spore exposure over time,
exacerbating the effects of spore exposure. Small differences in
rates of apoptosis could be magnified by downstream effects
leading to greater differences in response to S. chartarum
exposure. In addition, it has been hypothesized that exposure to
cigarette smoke might make infants more susceptible to acute
idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage (Etzel et al., 1998). 
Interestingly, it has been reported that cigarette smoke exposure
inhibits the natural activity of the mucociliary escalator (Cohen
et al., 1979). Such an environmental cause of reduced
clearance might further exacerbate pulmonary hemorrhage in
an already susceptible infant.
Through this and previous work, we have demonstrated that
different mouse strains respond differently to S. chartarum. We
interpret the data as showing that both reduced clearance of and
higher macrophage cytotoxicity from the bioactive components
of S. chartarum in humans might cause similar differences in
susceptibility among the human population. The results from
this study are the first evidence that differences in spore
clearance and macrophage susceptibility to spore-induced
death may contribute to strain differences in susceptibility to
S. chartarum seen in vivo. That these differences have a genetic
basis is not unlikely.
A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report concluded that S.
chartarum was responsible for acute idiopathic pulmonary
hemorrhage in a cluster of infants (Dearborn et al., 1999; Etzel
et al., 1998), although there may have been other contributing
factors such as environmental tobacco smoke or consequences
of water damage including bacterial exposures (Dearborn et al.,
1999). The original CDC report and a later case study suggested
that African-American babies were more likely than Caucasian
119
120
babies to die of acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage after
exposure to S. chartarum (Dearborn et al., 1999, 2002; Etzel
et al., 1998). It is unclear if the observed ethnic differences were
because of choice of controls or to economic or other
environmental factors that are correlates of race, genetic
differences, or a combination of both.
Genetic variability in human populations may account for
some of the wide variation among individuals responding to
mold exposure in contaminated occupational and domestic
settings. In addition, other concomitant conditions, such as
cigarette smoke exposure or bacterial infection, might further
exacerbate poor spore clearance in susceptible populations.
Future directions include determination of the genetic loci
responsible for differential clearance of S. chartarum and their
interactions with environmental factors. It would be of further
interest to test the effects of cigarette smoke or concomitant
exposure to other pathogens on spore clearance.

Some radioactive spore constituents might thus persist in the

suggest that C57BL/6J mice are able to clear S. chartarum

C57BL/6J AMs died at spore doses as low as 1000 spores per

macrophages, the log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 2.29 - 0.20 (log(dose)) and
log(yBALB/c) ¼ 2.04 - 0.06 (log(dose)), where y represents the
percent of live cells and dose represents the number of spores
per well. For doses greater than 200 spores per 75,000 
macrophages, the log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 4.04 - 0.97 (log(dose)) and
log(yBALB/c) ¼ 3.4731 - 0.68 (log(dose)), where y represents
the percent of live cells and dose represents the number
of spores per 75,000 macrophages. At doses higher than
200 spores/well, the slopes are significantly different
(p ¼ 0.007) between the two mouse strains.
C57BL/6J AMs died more rapidly in response to S. chartarum
than do BALB/c AMs. The equations describing their cell death
after addition of 1000 spores are log(yC57BL/6J) ¼ 1.87 - 0.098
(time) and log(yBALB/c) ¼ 1.84 - 0.086 (time), where y is the
percent of live cells and time is the amount of time after spore
addition in hours. The slopes of these two lines are significantly
different (p ¼ 0.04). This strain difference is consistent with
C57BL/6J mice producing significantly lower levels of 
inflammatory cytokines in vivo (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006).
SST and SG Kill More AMs from C57BL/6J than BALB/c
Increasing doses of SST cause increased cytotoxicity in AMs
from both mouse strains (p ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 6A). This is also
true for SG only (p ¼ 0.0001), (Fig. 6B). However, we
observed a range of low concentrations where little change is
seen, but at higher concentrations there is a linear relationship
when percent survival is plotted against concentration.
Importantly, we show that SG, although having significant
cytotoxicity, does not account for all the cytotoxicity of SST.
Thus, SG is a significant component, but there are also others.
The concentration that is lethal for 25% of the cells (LC25) for
SST for C57BL/6J is 0.017 lg/ml SG equivalents and for
BALB/c is 0.052 lg/ml SG equivalents. The LC25 for SG for
C57BL/6J is 0.075 lg/ml and for BALB/c is 0.243 lg/ml. We
used LC25 rather than LC50 because LC50 is outside the known
linear range of our data for SG in BALB/c macrophages. Based
on these numbers, SG accounts for ~20 to 25% of the toxicity
of the SST.
After 1 day of treatment with SST, more C57BL/6J AMs die
than BALB/c AMs at doses between 0.01 and 0.5 lg SG
equivalents/ml (p ¼ 0.02). The slopes between those doses are
-0.41 and -0.23 for C57BL/6J and BALB/c, respectively
(Fig. 6A). Similarly, after 1 day of treatment with SG, more
C57BL/6J AMs die than BALB/c AMs at doses between
0.03 and 0.7 lg SG/ml (p ¼ 0.059). The slopes between those
doses are -0.27 and -0.18 for C57BL/6J and BALB/c,
respectively (Fig. 6B). The two mouse strains showed

We investigated differences in the pulmonary and systemic
clearance of Stachybotrys chartarum spores in two strains of mice,
BALB/c and C57BL/6J. To evaluate clearance, mice were 
intratracheally instilled with a suspension of radiolabeled S. chartarum
spores or with unlabeled spores. The lungs of C57BL/6J mice
showed more rapid spore clearance than the lungs of BALB/c
mice, which correlated with increased levels of spore-associated
radioactivity in the GI tracts of C57BL/6J as compared with
BALB/c mice. To identify mechanisms responsible for mouse
strain differences in spore clearance and previously described lung
inflammatory responses, we exposed alveolar macrophages (AMs)
lavaged from BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice to S. chartarum spores,
S. chartarum spore toxin (SST), and satratoxin G (SG) in vitro.
The S. chartarum spores were found to be highly toxic with most
cells from either mouse strain being killed within 24 h when
exposed to a spore:cell ratio of 1:75. The spores were more lethal
to AMs from C57BL/6J than those from BALB/c mice. In mice,
the SST elicited many of the same inflammatory responses as the
spores in vivo, including AM recruitment, pulmonary hemorrhage,
and cytokine production. Our data suggest that differences in
pulmonary spore clearance may contribute to the differences in
pulmonary responses to S. chartarum between BALB/c and
C57BL/6J mice. Enhanced AM survival and subsequent 
macro-phage-mediated inflammation may also contribute to the higher
susceptibility of BALB/c mice to S. chartarum pulmonary effects.
Analogous genetic differences among humans may contribute to
reported variable sensitivity to S. chartarum.

multiple symptoms, including muscle aches, headaches, cough,
pulmonary hemorrhage, dermatitis, and interstitial lung disease
(Cooley et al., 1998). Infant deaths from acute idiopathic
pulmonary hemorrhage have been hypothesized to be caused in
part by this fungus (Dearborn et al., 1999; Etzel et al., 1998).
Responsiveness to S. chartarum is idiosyncratic; some humans
respond, others do not. Because separating environmental from
genetic effects is difficult in humans, we used a mouse model
(Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006) and an in vitro cell assay
to elucidate mechanisms of responses to S. chartarum and to
clarify the importance of strain differences that reflect genetic
components of host responses.
Stachybotrys chartarum grows well at room temperature on
wet surfaces composed of cellulose-containing materials such
as paper, ceiling tiles, and cardboard (Murtoniemi et al., 2003).
With appropriate temperature, light, and relative humidity, it
produces mycotoxins, including macrocyclic trichothecenes
such as satratoxin G (SG), which inhibit protein and DNA
synthesis, induce protein degradation, disrupt cellular function,
and cause cellular injury and inflammation (Bae et al., 2009;
Hastings et al., 2005; Hudson et al., 2005; Kankkunen et al.,
2009; McCrae et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Yike et al., 2007).
The fungus also releases stachylysin that can lead to pulmonary
hemorrhage (Vesper SJ and Vesper MJ, 2002).
Previous experiments used exposures of rats and mice to
S. chartarum spores intranasally and intratracheally; lung tissue
was examined for histological changes and bronchoalveolar
lavage for evidence of injury and inflammation (Nikulin et al.,
1996, 1997; Rao et al., 2000; Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006). Stachybotrys chartarum has been consistently reported
to cause pulmonary hemorrhage and extensive inflammation as
well as apoptosis, cytokine release, DNA damage, and changes
in gene expression (Bae et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2003b;
Dearborn et al., 1999; Islam et al., 2006, 2008; Penttinen et al.,
114
2007; Rand et al., 2002, 2003; Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.,
2006; Wang and Yadav, 2006, 2007). In addition to
mycotoxins, S. chartarum releases SchS34, a 34-kD antigen
(Rand and Miller, 2008).
We have previously shown that BALB/c mice respond more
to pulmonary exposure to S. chartarum spores than do C57BL/
6J or C3H/HeJ mice (Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al., 2006).
Lungs from exposed BALB/c mice showed the most
hemorrhage, the highest permeability of the air-blood barrier,
the most white blood cell recruitment, and the highest
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in response to
intratracheally instilled spores of S. chartarum. Our data also
show that mice have dose-dependent pulmonary responses to
S. chartarum and that their genetic background affects the
slope of these dose-response curves.
We wanted to know whether strain differences influence
clearance kinetics of spores. BALB/c mice clear both Bacillus
anthracis and Cryptococcus neoformans from the lungs more
efficiently than do C57BL/6J mice (Decken et al., 1998; Lyons
et al., 2004). The mucociliary escalator and macrophage
activity play important roles in the pulmonary clearance of
pathogens in the lungs; multiple environmental factors
modulate this role.
In this study, we sought to clarify the roles of pulmonary
clearance and macrophage cytotoxicity in modulating
responses to S. chartarum. We hypothesized that the observed
strain differences in S. chartarum responsiveness are mediated
in part by different rates of pulmonary spore clearance. The two
mouse strains we employed here, C57BL/6J and BALB/c, are
inbred strains developed independently and differ from each
other at over 50% of characterized genetic loci (Taconic,
1998a,b). Both strains are TLR2þ and TLR4þ (Matsuguchi
et al., 2003; Poltorak et al., 1998). BALB/c mice have been
shown to be Th2 dominant, whereas C57BL/6 mice are Th1
dominant as summarized by Rosenblum Lichtenstein et al.
(2006). Because alveolar macrophages (AMs) from C57BL/6
mice have been shown to have a higher phagocytic capacity
than AMs from BALB/c mice (Su et al., 2001), we
hypothesized that C57BL/6J mice might clear spores more
efficiently than BALB/c mice, leading to differences in
integrated spore dose over time. This may contribute to the
increased pulmonary inflammation seen in BALB/c as
compared with C57BL/6J mice. We also hypothesized that
differences in AM sensitivity to S. chartarum-induced
cytotoxicity influence both inflammation and spore clearance.

± SE versus time (log scale) after administration (hours). For 14C, the equation 
that best describes the clearance in BALB/c mice is log(y) ¼ 1.84  0.08 log(x) 
(error in data is too large to determine linearity, p¼ 0.14) and for C57BL/6J mice 
it is log(y) ¼ 1.76 - 0.21 log(x) (data are linear, p ¼ 0.03).

FIG. 6. SST and SG cytotoxicity in vitro. SST and SG both cause 
a significant dose response in both strains of mice (p ¼ 0.0001). SST and SG 
are significantly more cytotoxic to C57BL/6J AMs than to BALB/c AMs 
(*p ¼ 0.02 and **p ¼ 0.059 respectively)-75,000 live cells plated per well for 
all wells. Data are shown as mean ± SE. Graphs are on a log-log scale.

FIG. 5. Spore cytotoxicity in vitro. Spores are significantly more cytotoxic 
to C57BL/6J AMs than to BALB/c AMs. A total of 75,000 cells were plated 
per well for all wells. Data are shown as mean ± SE. (A) Dose (spores per 
macrophage) verses live cells as a percent of baseline (baselines are calculated 
as the total number of live and dead cells in matched wells with no spores). 
Graph is on a log-log scale. Slopes from 0.0027 to 0.06667 spores per 
macrophage for C57BL/6J (0.97) are significantly different from BALB/c 
(0.68) (*p ¼ 0.007, repeated measures analysis, broken stick model). (B) Time 
course of cytotoxicity at 0.0133 spores per macrophage dose. Time (hours) 
versus live cells as a percent of baseline (baselines are calculated as the total 
number of live and dead cells in matched wells with no spores). Percent is 
graphed on a log scale. Slope of C57BL/6J (0.098) is significantly different 
from BALB/c (0.086) (**p ¼ 0.04, repeated measures analysis).
