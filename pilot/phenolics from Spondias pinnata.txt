Role of phenolics from Spondias pinnata
bark in amelioration of iron overload
induced hepatic damage in Swiss
albino mice
Dipankar Chaudhuri†, Nikhil Baban Ghate†, Sourav Panja and Nripendranath Mandal*
Abstract
Background: Crude Spondias pinnata bark extract was previously assessed for its antioxidant, anticancer and iron
chelating potentials. The isolated compounds gallic acid (GA) and methyl gallate (MG) were evaluated for their
curative potential against iron overload-induced liver fibrosis and hepatocellular damage.
Methods: In vitro iron chelation property and in vivo ameliorating potential from iron overload induced liver
toxicity of GA and MG was assessed by different biochemical assays and histopathological studies.
Results: MG and GA demonstrated excellent reducing power activities but iron chelation potential of MG is better
than GA. Oral MG treatment in mice displayed excellent efficacy (better than GA) to significantly restore the levels
of liver antioxidants, serum markers and cellular reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent fashion. Apart from
these, MG exceptionally prevented lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation whereas GA demonstrated better activity
to reduce collagen content, thereby strengthening its position as an efficient drug against hepatic damage/fibrosis,
which was further supported by histopathological studies. Alongside, MG efficiently eliminated the cause of liver
damage, i.e., excess iron, by chelating free iron and reducing the ferritin-bound iron.
Conclusions: The present study confirmed the curative effect of GA and MG against iron overload hepatic damage via
their potent antioxidant and iron-chelating potential.

Background
An imbalance in pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis
eventually gives rise to the physical condition known as
“oxidative stress”. An irregular surge in oxidants such as
reactive species of oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) is
generated endogenously through mitochondrial respiration
as well as through exogenous oxidizing agents including
ionizing radiation, heavy metals, and hypoxia. These 
oxidants come in contact with different biological molecules
such as proteins, lipids and DNA, thereby disrupting them
and causing maladies such as cancer, atherosclerosis,
cardiovascular disease, liver injury, aging and inflammatory

diseases [1]. Previous research has indicated that 
redox-active metals such as iron also play a major role in ROS
over production, mainly through highly reactive hydroxyl
radicals by undergoing redox cycling [2]. Conversely, liver
executes the normal metabolic balance of the body as well
as biotransformation, detoxification and excretion of 
several toxic by-products. Increasing evidence has indicated
that oxidative stress and its associated damage designate a
common association between different forms of chronic
liver injuries and hepatic fibrosis [3] due to iron overload
[4]. Thus, any substance that is capable of providing
protection against metal toxicity by trapping free 
radicals or by chelating metal ions that would consequently
terminate the chain reaction of free radicals acts as an
antioxidant [5]. In addition to endogenous antioxidant

natural antioxidants also exhibits increased resistance
to oxidative stress by altering the redox environment
and is associated with a lower risk of many oxidative
stress-related diseases.
Several phenolics and flavonoids from natural resources
effectively scavenge different free radicals through their
relevant iron chelating capabilities. Previous reports 
suggested that these types of compounds could also be used
to treat iron-induced liver toxicity [6]. Crude Spondias
pinnata (Linn. f.) Kurz (Fam. Anacardiaceae) extract was
previously studied for its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant
and iron chelating potential, which also demonstrated
the presence of significant amounts of phenolic and
flavonoid compounds [7, 8]. These previous studies
prompted us to isolate phenolic compounds from
Spondias pinnata bark and evaluate their 
ameliorating effect on iron overload-induced hepatotoxicity
and hepatic fibrosis in mice.
Methods
Reagents
Bathophenanthroline sulfonate disodium salt, 5,5′-dithio-
bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) and N-(1-Naphthyl) 
ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) were procured from
Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, India. 1-chloro-2,4-
dinitrobenzene (CDNB), Dimethyl-4-aminobenzaldehyde,
and N,N- dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline ammonium iron (II)
sulfate hexahydrate ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 6H2O) were obtained
from Merck, Mumbai, India. Guanidine hydrochloride
and Iron-dextran was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. Cipla Ltd., India provided Desirox (Generic
name-Deferasirox). All of the other used reagents were
of molecular biology grade and were obtained from
reputable suppliers.
Test animals
In vivo experiments were performed abiding by the 
guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and
Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), 
Ministry of Environment and Forest, Govt. of India with due
approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee,
Bose Institute (Registration. No. 95/1999/CPCSEA). Male
Swiss albino mice (20 ± 2 g) were obtained from the
Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), Kolkata,
India and were acclimated under a constant 12 h light/
dark cycle at 22 ± 2 °C. The animals were fed on general
laboratory diet and water ad libitum. Experimental
animals were taken care every 6 h during the treatment
period and it was observed that there was no unwanted
animal death. All surgeries were done using ethyl ether as
anesthetic (by inhalation in a ethyl ether saturated 
chamber inside a fume hood), taking utmost care to reduce
suffering.
Plant material
S. pinnata bark was collected from the villages of Bankura
district, West Bengal, India and the plant was 
authenticated by Dr. Jayaram Hazra, Director, Central Research
Institute of Ayurveda (CRIA), Kolkata, India. The 
herbarium was submitted at CRIA, Kolkata with an accession no
of CRHS 111/08.
Extraction and isolation of phyto-compounds
Different compounds were isolated following the method
of Chaudhuri, et al. [9]. Briefly, the S. pinnata stem bark
was cut into small pieces, dried, ground into powder,
and extracted with 70 % methanol and water. The 
lyoph-ilized extract was re-extracted successively with hexane,
chloroform, ethyl acetate and water. All of the fractions
were concentrated in reduced pressure, and the ethyl
acetate fraction was further purified through silica gel
column chromatography. Dichloromethane and 
methanol elution yielded four compounds namely SPE1, SPE2,
SPE3 and SPE4. Structures of the bioactive compounds
were analysed using different spectroscopic methods
such as EIMS (JEOL JMS-700, Germany), FT-IR spectra
recorded in KBr (Perkin Elmer, USA) and different 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments including
1H and 13C with a Bruker-500 MHz NMR Spectrometer
(Germany).
In vitro reducing power and iron chelation potential of
the isolated compounds
Fe3+-reducing power of the compounds was determined
by a standard method [10] where ascorbic acid was used
as standard. Various concentrations (0-1.0 mg/ml) of
the compounds were tested and their absorbance was
measured at 700 nm against an appropriate blank. The
Fe2+ chelating ability was determined as described earlier,
and the result was expressed as inhibition percentage [7].
Briefly, in HEPES buffer (20 m mol/l, pH 7.2) medium,
test samples (0-120 μg/ml) and positive control EDTA
(0-20 μg/ml) were separately added to a 12.5 μ mol/l 
ferrous sulfate solution and 75 μ mol/l ferrozine was added
to start the reaction. After rapid vortexing the mixture
was left at room temperature for 20 min and absorbance
was taken at 562 nm (OD). The percentage of inhibition
of ferrozine-Fe2+ complex formation was determined by
the formula- % of inhibition = [(Control OD-Sample OD)/
Control OD] × 100. All tests were performed six times.
In vivo hepato-ameliorating activity
Experimental design and tissue preparation
In total, nine groups of mice were randomly prepared
consisting of six mice per group. Among them, one
group received normal saline only, which was labeled as
a blank (B); however, other groups were intoxicated with
five doses of 100 mg/kg b.w. iron-dextran (one dose
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 3 of 14
every alternative days) by intraperitoneal injection (ip).
Of the groups, one iron-dextran group (C) was treated
orally with only saline, and other groups were treated
orally with 2 mg/kg b.w. gallic acid (GA) (R2), 2 mg/kg
b.w. methyl gallate (MG) (S2), 4 mg/kg b.w. GA (R4),
4 mg/kg b.w. MG (S4), 8 mg/kg b.w. GA (R8), 8 mg/kg
b.w. MG (S8) test samples and 20 mg/kg b.w. desirox
(D) for 21 consecutive days starting the day following
the first iron-dextran injection. All experimental animals
were sacrificed on 22nd day under mild anesthesia (ethyl
ether), and cardiac puncture was performed to collect
blood and serum was separated and stored at −80 °C.
After collecting the blood, the liver was quickly excised,
cleaned thoroughly with cold phosphate buffer saline
(PBS) to remove the remaining blood and cut into three
sections. The major liver portion was dissected and
homogenized using 10 volumes of 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.15 M NaCl and
5 mM EDTA and centrifuged for 30 min at 8000 g in
the cold. The clear homogenate (supernatant) was
collected and the protein concentration was quantified by
Folin-Lowry method [11], where BSA was used as a 
standard; the remaining supernatant was then stored at −80 °C.
Second liver fragment was treated with a mixture of nitric
acid and sulfuric acid (1:1) to analyze the iron content.
The last portion was processed for histopathological
examinations.
Serum ferritin and liver iron levels
Manufacturer’s instructions were followed to quantify
serum ferritin levels using an ELISA kit from Monobind
Inc., USA. Liver iron content was quantified using a 
previously reported method [12]. Briefly, samples were mixed
with bathophenanthroline sulfonate and incubated at 37 °C
for 30 min, and absorbance was recorded using a 
spectro-photometer (Shimadzu, UV-2401PC, Japan) at 535 nm.
In vitro ferritin iron release
Iron reduction and release were determined using 
ferrozine, a spectrophotometric reagent for iron, as 
previously described [13]. Briefly, the reaction was initiated
by adding different concentrations (100-500 μg/ml) of
test compounds in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
containing 200 μg ferritin and 500 μM ferrozine, and the
absorbance change was measured for 20 min at 560 nm.
The reaction mixture excluding the test samples was
used as a reference.
Serum markers
Aspartate amino transferase (ASAT), alanine amino
transferase (ALAT), and bilirubin levels in serum were
evaluated using commonly available kits from Merck,
India. Similarly, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were
measured by a kit from Sentinel diagnostics, Italy.
Antioxidant enzymes
Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), 
glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and reduced glutathione (GSH)
levels were measured using previously described
methods [14-17].
Measurement of ROS levels in liver, spleen homogenate and
serum
ROS levels in liver and spleen tissue homogenate and
serum were estimated using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFDA) following the method of Rashid
et al. [18] with slight modifications. Briefly, the 
sample containing 50 μg protein was mixed with 1 ml
assay buffer (130 mM KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM
NaH2PO4, 20 mM Tris HCl, 30 mM Glucose and
10 μM DCFDA) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min
in the dark. DCF formation was recorded at the 
excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength
of 523 nm for 2 min using a fluorescence 
spectrometer (Hitachi, Model F4500) that had been equipped
with a FITC filter.
Evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis
Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) quantities
were measured to evaluate the levels of lipid peroxidation
[19]. Protein oxidation levels were resolved by estimating
protein carbonyl contents [20]. Collagen content, an
important marker of liver fibrosis, was evaluated using
previously described methods [21]. Collagen content in
each sample was determined by multiplying 7.69 by overall
hydroxyproline content [22].
Histopathological studies
Excised liver samples were cleaned with saline and
fixed for two days in 10 % buffered neutral formalin.
Sections (5 μm thick) were paraffin-embedded and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (morphological
examination), Perls’ Prussian blue dye (iron content)
and Masson’s trichrome stain (liver fibrosis). Stained
sections were checked microscopically for 
histopathological changes.
Statistical analysis
All of the data were reported as the mean ± SD of six
measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using
KyPlot version 2.0 beta 15 (32 bit) and Microsoft excel
2010. The relationships between the groups were
evaluated using a paired t-test for in vitro study and one
way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc tests for
in vivo study, and a p value of <0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.

Results
In vitro iron chelation and reducing power potential
The iron chelation potential of the isolated 
compounds was measured using two essential methods:
Fe3+ reducing power and iron chelation properties.
SPE1 and SPE2 failed to show any activity in both
the assays and SPE3, standard ascorbic acid 
demonstrated corresponding reducing power activities, which
were although higher than SPE4 (Fig. 1a). Conversely,
SPE4 demonstrated excellent and better in vitro iron
chelation activity than SPE3 (Fig. 1b). The structure
of SPE3, SPE4 (Fig. 2) was determined as Gallic acid
(GA), and Methly gallate (MG) using different 
spectroscopic experimental data shown in Additional file 1. The
IC50 value of MG and GA in iron chelation property is
129.85 ± 6.90 μg/ml and 1007.35 ± 141.31 μg/ml (n = 6)
respectively.
In vivo studies
Serum ferritin and liver iron levels
Increase in hepatic iron content and serum ferritin levels
were observed in the iron-overloaded mice compared
with the normal mouse group. Upon GA and MG
administration, notable tendencies of a dose-dependent
reduction in liver iron content (Fig. 3a) as well as serum
ferritin concentrations (Fig. 3b) were observed. The
highest dose of MG demonstrated better activity than
the standard drug desirox and significantly eliminated
the excess iron, thus making the condition equal to the
normal mice group.
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 5 of 14
Iron release from ferritin
A dose dependent increase in the formation of the
ferrous-ferrozine complex [(Fe(ferrozine)3)2+] was 
measured to quantify the efficiency of GA and MG in releasing
the reduced iron from ferritin. Experiments without test
samples formed insignificant quantities of the reduced
iron ferrozine complex, whereas increasing concentrations
significantly released iron from ferrozine with time
(Fig. 4a). MG also demonstrated better activity than GA,
but when the percentage of iron released from ferritin and
the reducing power of the test samples were correlated
(Fig. 4b).
Antioxidant enzymes
The iron-overloaded condition stimulated an oxidative
stress condition that significantly reduces levels of
antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant
GSH compared with normal mice. Oral administration
of GA and MG indicated significant restoration of the
antioxidant enzymes almost to the normal state. In the
case of SOD (Fig. 5a), MG exhibited better activity than
standard treatment. At the highest MG dose, catalase
(Fig. 5b), GST (Fig. 5c) and GSH (Fig. 5d) levels nearly
approached standard desirox levels, while GA displayed
moderate activity.
ROS levels
The ROS levels in liver and spleen homogenates as well
as serum were increased in the iron overloaded mice
compared with normal mice. Upon GA and MG
administration, the levels gradually regressed towards
the normal condition (Fig. 6a, b and c, respectively).
Treatment with GA reduced the levels of ROS in liver
and spleen homogenate better than MG as well as
desirox treatment. But serum ROS levels were more
greatly reduced by MG than GA treatment.
Serum markers
The elevated levels of serum enzymes and bilirubin
markedly dose-dependently decreased after oral GA and
MG administration. From Table 1, it is clear that higher
doses of MG displayed better activity than GA and the
standard desirox in all cases except for bilirubin.
Biochemical parameters of liver damage
The effect of iron overload on liver damage was
measured by the level of lipid peroxidation, protein
carbonyl and collagen content in the liver homogenate.
When treated with the test compounds, thiobarbituric
acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels, which measures
MDA, were substantially decreased (Fig. 7a). In case of
protein carbonyl content, MG exceptionally prevented
protein oxidation because protein carbonyl content is
almost similar to normal mice (Fig. 7b). However, in the
case of hydroxylproline, i.e., collagen content, GA
exhibited marginally better activity than MG and
similar activity to standard desirox (Fig. 7c).

Histopathological study
Biopsy sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
for morphologic evaluation, Perls’ Prussian Blue stain for
assessment of iron loading, and Masson’s trichrome stain
for assessment of fibrosis. Liver sections from normal mice
demonstrated normal cell morphology with prominent
nuclei in well-preserved cytoplasm and prominent central
vein without cellular infiltration (Fig. 8a), whereas iron
*p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p≤ 0.001 compared with the blank and #p≤ 0.05, ##p≤ 0.01, ###p≤ 0.001 compared with the control
dextran overloaded mice demonstrated various degrees of
pathological changes including ballooning degeneration,
inflammation, loss of cellular boundaries, and 
hepatocellular necrosis (Fig. 8b). In contrast, the liver sections taken
from GA (Fig. 8d-f) and MG (Fig. 8g-i) treated mice
groups displayed attenuation of pathogenicity and gradual
reversal to normal cyto-architecture with a higher dosage,
thus restoring the normal condition. Figure 8c represents
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 7 of 14
liver sections of the desirox-treated group with improved
histology, which is similar to the highest doses of GA and
MG. Another detrimental effect of excess iron in liver is
deposition of iron in the form crystalline ferritine and
amorphous hemosiderin. Iron released from denatured
ferritin, ferric oxide (unused iron) as well as broken
hemoglobin formed a complex to store the iron known as
hemosiderin. The iron within the deposits of hemosiderin
is poorly available to the body and tissue sections stained
with Perls’ Prussian blue is commonly used to detect its
deposition in liver tissue as blue patches. The liver 
sections from untreated iron overloaded mice demonstrated
increased hemosiderin deposition (Fig. 9b) compared with
normal mice (Fig. 9a). However, sections from the treated
mice groups demonstrated a gradual decrease in 
hemosiderin deposition patches (Fig. 9d-f for GA and 9g-i for
MG). The highest dose of MG exhibited a parallel effect to
the standard desirox-treated group (Fig. 9c). Accumulated
collagen in liver was also stained blue using Masson’s
trichrome. The microscopic observation suggested that
the liver section of control mice revealed normal lobular
architecture and distribution of collagen (Fig. 10a). From
the liver section of iron-overloaded mice it is evident that
the normal architecture of the liver is destroyed and the
nodules surrounded by accumulated collagen indicating 
fibrous cirrhotic (Fig. 10b). However, after treatment with
the test samples, a gradual decrease in the degree of 
collagen deposition was observed (Fig. 10d-f for GA and 10g-i
for MG). Here, the highest MG dose also demonstrated a
similar scenario compared with the standard 
desirox-treated group (Fig. 10c).
Discussion
Free radicals and iron metal are essential entities of aerobic
life and modulate various physiological functions [23]. In
iron-overloaded liver, iron reacts with the cellular hydrogen
peroxide to generate hydroxyl radical (Fenton reaction)
which in turn initiate the propagation of various ROS. This
situation leads to oxidative stress which damage in
liver tissue mostly via lipid peroxidation of biological
membranes [24]. However, the preventive system of our
body is inadequate to handle excess free radicals; 
therefore, external antioxidant iron chelator supplements are
essential to maintain healthy physiological conditions. An

effective remedial strategy should act in a dual character
by decreasing the oxidation rate; one method is 
sequestering and chelating the stored iron in cells [25], and the
other is a radical trap (i.e., antioxidant activity). Though
the development of some synthetic antioxidants and iron
chelating drugs has thrived recently, they are not yet
widely accepted as therapeutic agents due to several side
effects and disadvantages. Thus, there is a growing
demand to develop more effective and safe therapeutic
approaches to chelate catalytically active cytosolic iron
[25] and concurrently protect cells from excess free
radicals. Several bio resources have already been
reported as natural antioxidants with iron chelating
potentials [26, 27].
Results of in vitro iron chelation and reducing power
property of the isolated compound from ethyl acetate
fraction suggest that on SPE3 and SPE4 do possessed
both the activities where other two compounds failed to
show any activity. So, the structure of SPE3 and SPE4
was elucidated and found to be gallic acid (GA) and
methyl gallate (MG). MG exhibited better iron chelation
than GA although their basic structure is alike. So, this
iron chelation result further supported the findings of
Yang et al. [28] who suggested that Fe(III) in Hepes
buffer, pH 7.4 interacted with three molecules of MG
and produced a Fe(III)-MG3 complex with a stable
octahedral geometry (binding constant- K is in the range
of 1 × 1034/M to 1 × 1036/M) and chelate-free iron better
than GA.
Both the compounds, GA and MG have demonstrated
excellent in vitro iron chelation anf reducing power
potency, a study on the in vivo ameliorating effect of GA
and MG in iron overloaded liver toxicity and liver
fibrosis in mice was constructed. Hemochromatosis was
created by intraperitoneal injection of iron-dextran. This
process will not hamper intestinal iron absorption by the
test compounds, which ultimately leads to iron overload
in liver and serum [29].
The excess iron stored in the liver as ferritin or 
hemosiderin [30]. Thus, most procedures seek to measure
liver iron levels for diagnosis of iron overload disease. In
contrast, ferritin, a ubiquitous intracellular iron-binding
protein, generally stores iron in a non-toxic ferric form
and releases it in a controlled fashion whenever needed
[31]. Serum ferritin is a key marker that was developed
as a consequence of iron overload-induced hepatic
toxicity, as blood ferritin content indirectly reveals the
amount of hepatic iron content. The decrease in hepatic
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 10 of 14
iron deposition after MG treatment justified its in vitro
iron-chelating effectiveness.
In hepatocytes, ferritin stores excess iron in the ferric
state. To overcome iron overload, various readily available
iron chelator drugs are administered, but many of them
struggle with a narrow binding capacity for ferric iron
(Fe3+). Thus, reducing agents such as ascorbic acid
need to be administered as supplements to upsurge
the accessibility of stored iron to chelators [32]. From
the result it was found that both MG and GA effectively
release iron from ferritin which also nicely correlated with
their reducing power capacity. GA possessed a greater 
correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9674) than MG (R2 = 0.7872).
This also validated the superior reducing power activity of
GA over MG.
Living cells are equipped with an array of endogenous
antioxidant enzymes such as GST, SOD, CAT and the
small compound GSH, which are first line of defenses
against excessive free radicals. Evaluating the levels of
these antioxidant enzymes is a proper indirect way to
assess pro-oxidant-antioxidant combat in tissues [33].
SOD destroys superoxide free radicals by converting
them into H2O2, whereas catalase further decomposes
excess H2O2 to H2O and O2. Catalase efficiency is so 
commendable that it cannot be saturated by any concentration
of H2O2 [34]. The cellular GSH system is probably the
most important cellular defense mechanism, which not
only acts as a ROS scavenger but also regulates the
intracellular redox state [35]. The results suggested that
MG restore the antioxidant enzymes much better than
GA and the activity is almost equal to standard drug
Desirox (20 mg/kg.b.w) but in lower concentration
(8 mg/kg.b.w).
The previous phenomenon can also be further 
supported by the obtained ROS levels in liver spleen
homogenates and serum in iron overloaded condition
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 11 of 14
as well as after treatment. Surprisingly, GA exhibited
much better activity than MG and desirox, which also
supported its excellent antioxidant and free radical
scavenging potentials. On the other hand, MG 
exhibited better ROS level reduction in serum of the iron
overloaded mice. It is speculated that MG, which is
an excellent iron chelator, assists albumin to further
chelate excess iron, thereby lowering serum ROS
levels. Generally, albumin represents the predominant
antioxidant in plasma, which is exposed to 
continuous oxidative stress [36]. Albumin concentrations 
increase in inflammation, and the antioxidant activities
of albumin result from its ligand-binding capacities of
ROS-producing metal such as copper and iron [37].
Levels of serum enzyme are checked in the clinical
diagnosis to determine the condition of various diseases
and tissue injury [38, 39]. These enzymes are 
predominantly found in the hepatic cell and liver damage due to
excess iron leads to the release of these intracellular
enzymes into the blood [40] as evident by increased
serum parameters (Table 1). The administration of the
test compounds has reduced the increased level of the
serum marker enzymes almost similar to the standard
desirox. This result indicated towards their healing
capabilities of hepatic parenchyma and regeneration of
hepatocyte as well as its functional efficiency [41].
Hence, MG not only helped to overcome oxidative stress
but also possessed better hepato-amelioration activity
compared with GA.
Cell membrane lipid peroxidation is the most 
detrimental result of iron-induced oxidative stress mainly via
hydroxyl radicals [42]. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the
resulting end products such as malondialdehyde (MDA)
act as an important factors of liver fibrosis by activating
hepatic stellate cells, resulting in increased pro-collagen α1
(I) gene expression [43-45]. This relationship between
lipid peroxidation and hepatic fibrosis is well established
in a variety of liver diseases including hemochromatosis,
Chaudhuri et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:34 Page 12 of 14
alcohol-induced liver injury and chronic hepatitis C [46].
Subsequent to hepatic cellular damage, collagen 
production predominates over hepatocellular regeneration as an
immediate healing response, thereby occupying the
injured areas instead of destroyed hepatocytes. Collagen
content is therefore considered to be a major marker of
liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity [47]. Iron-induced liver
pathogenicity also leads to the oxidation of various
important structural and functional proteins and forms
protein carbonyls. Thus, it serves as a marker of oxidative
stress and leads to the onset/development of various
diseases including cystic fibrosis and ulcerative colitis [30].
The chelation of excess iron by MG and GA further
strengthen the position of GA and MG in significantly
overcoming hepatic damage/fibrosis in iron intoxicated
mice, indicating the hepato-ameliorating potency of the
compounds.
A liver biopsy is considered to be the gold-standard
method for assessment of the degree of inflammation
and fibrosis alongside other biochemical tests. The liver
sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin exhibited
various degrees of inflammation, necrosis as well as cell
wall degeneration in iron overloaded condition, but dose
dependent treatment reduced the tissue damage that
also supported the result of the restoration of serum
enzyme and antioxidant enzyme levels. Perls’ Prussian
blue staining revealed the visual confirmation of iron
chelation property of the test compounds along with the
liver iron content and serum ferritin content. On the
other hand, Masson’s trichrome staining disclosed the

results in histopathological studies signifying in situ
evidence of ameliorating the effect of the iron 
overload-induced liver toxicity.
Conclusion
Excess iron plays a critical role in oxidative stress-related
hepato-toxicity and liver fibrosis, which is profoundly
supported by the results of the present study. Among the
isolated compounds from S. pinnata bark, MG exhibited
exceptional amelioration potential for hepatotoxicity
mainly due to its iron chelation capacity. In contrast, GA
failed to demonstrate brilliant iron chelation activity
in vitro, but it displayed a pleasing amendment of
oxidative stress and liver damage as it neutralized excess
generated free radicals due to iron overload before they
could attack any bio-entities. Thus, these two compounds
act in different pathways to achieve the same goal.
Although the isolated compounds showed similar effect as
desirox, they proved the rationale behind the activity of
the S. pinnata bark extract, which was already proven as
better and safer drug than standard Desirox. These
findings also suggest the beneficiary role of GA and MG
in the pathological sequence of iron-overload-linked liver
disease and fibrosis.
