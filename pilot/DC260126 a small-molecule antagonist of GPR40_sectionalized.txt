DC260126 Prevents Iˆ2-Cells Dysfunction
We speculated that inhibition of GPR40 by DC260126 could
partially protect pancreatic b-cells from FFAs induced lipotoxicity
and apoptosis. As we expected, treatment of DC260126 reduced
the number of apoptotic b-cells in db/db mice, which might get a
similar mechanism to the GPR40 antagonists did in MIN6 cells
[15]. Reduced apoptosis of pancreatic b-cells might provide
benefit for improving diabetic phenomenon, including insulin
resistance. However, unlike FFAs, GPR40 agonists only activate
GPR40 to amplify insulin secretion [12]. Thus, GPR40 agonists
might lead to less lipotoxicity in pancreatic b-cells.
In conclusion, although the GPR40 antagonist, DC260126
might not be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, our data
provided evidences that the theory under GPR40 antagonism for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes might be reasonable in the early
stage of type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatments
Male C57BL/KsJ-Lepdb (db/db) and their lean littermates were
obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA).
Animals were maintained in a 12 h light-dark cycle at a
temperature of 23uC with free access to water and regular chow
diet. To investigate the dose-dependent effect of DC260126, 
nine-week-old db/db male mice were divided into four groups (n = 6/
group). Mice were give vehicle (5% DMSO in PBS) or DC260126
(3, 10, 30 mg/kg) once daily by tail vein injection for 5 days. At
day 5, each group of mice were fasted for 6 h and blood samples
were collected from orbital venous plexus and centrifuged for
serum separation. Then the concentration of serum insulin level
was measured by ELISA kit (Millipore) following its protocol. For
long term experiments, six-week-old obese db/db male mice were
divided into two groups (n = 8/group) and given vehicle (5%
DMSO in PBS) or DC260126 (10 mg/kg) once daily by tail vein
injection for 24 days, respectively. Meanwhile, their lean
littermates were treated with vehicle in an identical manner as
normal control. Body weight and food intake were recorded
regularly. After 6 h fasting, blood glucose concentrations were
monitored by tail vein blood using a glucometer (One-touch Ultra,
Lifescan) every week. At the end of the experiment, mice were
fasted for 12 h to perform oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, day
21) and for 6 h to generate insulin tolerance test (ITT, day 23) as
described [16] with slight modification indicated in the figure
legend. Meanwhile, the insulin release during OGTT was also
measured, blood sample was obtained from tail veins and serum
insulin concentration was determined by ELISA kit (Alpco, USA).
At the end of experiment (day 24), mice were fasted for 6 h, and
blood samples were collected from orbital venous plexus and
centrifuged for serum separation. Then the animals were killed by
CO2 inhalation, the pancreas tissue were removed and kept in 4%
paraformaldehyde. All of the animal experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Shanghai
Institute of Materia Medica (No: SIMM-2011-01-WHY-04).
Serum biochemical analysis and proinsulin/insulin ratio
measurement
At the end of experiment, serum level of triglyceride (TG) and
total cholesterol (TC) was measured by kits (Rongsheng Biotech.
Shanghai, China) following their protocols. Serum concentration
of proinsulin and insulin were measured by ELISA kit (Alpco,
USA) following the protocol provided in the kit, respectively.
Proinsulin/insulin (P/I) ratio was calculated. The homeostatic
model assessment (HOMA) was calculated as Matthews et al.
described [17].
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining
The entire pancreas from lean and DC260126 or vehicle
treated db/db mice were removed for paraffin sections, and
immunohistochenmistry of insulin and proinsulin were carried out
following described methods [18]. At least 5 to 6 sections from
each independent individual were analyzed to calculate b-cell
mass according to the procedure described [19]. Generally, the
mean percentage area of insulin-positive b-cells was determined in
each group, and the value was then adjusted for total pancreatic
wet weight per animal. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, a common method for
the determination of cell apoptosis during early stage as it could
recognize DNA fragmentation [20], was carried out to evaluate
apoptotic pancreatic b-cells rate. Apoptotic cells in pancreas tissue
were detected by TUNEL kit (Merck) following its instruction. The
DC260126 Prevents Iˆ2-Cells Dysfunction
rate of apoptosis was calculated as number of TUNEL-positive
cells divided with the area of each islet.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the mean 6 SD. Two-tailed Student’s t
tests and ONE-WAY ANOVA analysis were performed to
determine statistically significant differences. A value of p,0.05
was considered significant at the 95% confidence level.

Abstract
G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) mediates both acute and chronic effects of free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin
secretion. However, it remains controversial whether inhibition of GPR40 would be beneficial in prevention of type 2
diabetes. This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of DC260126, a small molecule antagonist of GPR40, on 
b-cell function following administration of 10 mg/kg dose of DC260126 to obese diabetic db/db mice. Oral glucose tolerance
test, glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin tolerance test were used to investigate the pharmacological effects of
DC260126 on db/db mice after 21-days treatment. Immunohistochemistry and serum biochemical analysis were also
performed in this study. Although no significant change of blood glucose levels was found in DC260126-treated mice,
DC260126 significantly inhibited glucose stimulated insulin secretion, reduced blood insulin level and improved insulin
sensitivity after 3 weeks administration in db/db mice. Moreover, DC260126 reduced the proinsulin/insulin ratio and the
apoptotic rate of pancreatic b-cells remarkably in DC260126-treated db/db mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (p,0.05,
n = 8). The results suggest that although DC260126 could not provide benefit for improving hyperglycemia, it could protect
against pancreatic b-cells dysfunction through reducing overload of b-cells, and it increases insulin sensitivity possibly via
alleviation of hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice.

Introduction
Elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) levels are commonly
found in type 2 diabetes and are considered to be one of the most
important risk factors for type 2 diabetes [1,2,3]. The effects of
FFAs on pancreatic b-cells are complex and divergent [3]. Acute
administration of FFAs can amplify glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion (GSIS) of b-cells under normal circumstances, while
prolonged exposure to the saturated fatty acid impairs b-cells
function, which is known as lipotoxicity [4].
The G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) has been found
highly expressed in pancreatic b-cells in both human and rodents,
which could be activated by medium- and long-chain FFAs
[5,6,7]. GPR40 mediates both acute and chronic effects of FFAs
on insulin secretion and plays an important role in glucose
homeostasis [8]. FFAs could activate intracellular Ca2+ release via
GPR40, but the breakdown of Ca2+ homeostasis by sustained
elevation of FFA levels could trigger b-cell dysfunction and
apoptosis, which might be the mainly cause of FFA-induced
lipotoxicity [5,9]. Steneberg et al. firstly reported that GPR40
knockout mice were resistant to many effects of high-fatty-diet
(HFD), such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose
intolerance. Besides, the diabetic phenotype was observed in
transgenic mice overexpressing GPR40 in islets [8]. These results
suggest that inhibition of GPR40 may be useful for the prevention
and treatment of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. However, Lan
et al. reported that the deletion of GPR40 could not protect mice
from HFD-induced metabolic disease [10]. Nagasumi et al.
showed that overexpression of GPR40 in b-cells increased insulin
secretion and improved glucose tolerance in HFD-treated mice
[11]. Moreover, there is clear evidence that GPR40 agonist may
be useful in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia
[12,13]. These inconsistent results indicate that the role of
GPR40 in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes still needs further
studies.
In previous studies conducted with DC260126 (a novel class of
GPR40 antagonist), we have demonstrated that DC260126 could
protect MIN6 b-cells from palmitate-induced endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis [14,15]. And it could also reduce
hyperinsulinemia and improve insulin sensitivity in Zucker fatty
rats [16]. In this study, we investigated whether DC260126 is able
to prevent b-cells dysfunction in obese diabetic db/db mice. It is
found that hyperinsulinemia, proinsulin/insulin ratio and the
number of apoptotic b-cells were all reduced, and the insulin
resistance was improved following 21-days administration of
DC260126 in db/db mice.

Results
Effects of DC260126 on fasting serum insulin (FSI), fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) and other pharmacodynamic
biomarkers in db/db mice
After giving different dose of DC260126 to nine-week-old db/db
mice for 5 days, the FSI level was decreased dose-dependently.
And both 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg body weight could reduce FSI
level of db/db mice significantly (Fig. 1A). For long term
experiments, after giving 10 mg/kg body weight DC260126 to
6-week-old obese db/db male mice by tail vein injection once daily
for 3 weeks, no significant alteration in overall body weight gain
and daily food intake was found (Data not shown). And there was
no obvious difference in levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and
triglyceride (TG) (Data not shown). The FPG level was also similar
between DC260126 and vehicle group (Fig. 1B), indicating that 3
weeks administration of DC260126 in db/db mice could not
exhibit any significant change in levels of blood glucose or lipids.
However, the FSI level decreased significantly in 
DC260126-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2D).
HOMA-IR index was calculated, and the HOMA-IR was found
decreased in DC260126-treated mice compared to vehicle (Fig.
1C).
DC260126 inhibits compensatory increase of insulin
expression and b-cell mass
During the pre-diabetic state, a compensatory phase is induced
by peripheral insulin resistance in pancreatic b-cells. In this phase,
b-cell mass and insulin output were increased [21]. Finally,
constant increased secretion of insulin leads to b-cell exhaustion
[21,22]. Thus, preventing b-cells from overload might provide
benefit for preventing b-cell failure. We found that DC260126
could lower fasted serum insulin levels (Fig. 2D) and alter 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3B) in db/db mice. To investigate
the inhibitory effect of DC260126 on the compensatory increase of
insulin expression and pancreatic b-cell mass, 
immunohistochem-istry staining for insulin was performed. An increased insulin
expression in the islets of Langerhans in db/db mice was found
compared with their lean mates. In DC260126 treated db/db mice,
however, insulin expression was decreased in islet compared with
vehicle treated db/db mice (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, a significant
increase was found in pancreatic b-cell mass in 9-week-old db/db
mice compared with their lean littermates, whereas the b-cell mass
of DC260126 group was effectively lower than vehicle treated db/
db mice after 3 weeks administration (Fig. 2C). These results
provide strong evidence that DC260126 could prevent b-cells
from overload to resist compensatory increasing in insulin
expression, b-cell mass and serum insulin levels of db/db mice
via inhibition of GPR40.
Effect of DC260126 on blood glucose and insulin levels
during OGTT and ITT in db/db mice

metabolism and insulin secretion in db/db mice, OGTT and

ITT were performed after 3 weeks administration of DC260126.
Although the glucose levels during OGTT in DC260126-treated
mice were similar to that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3A and D),
DC260126-treated mice showed an obvious decrease of blood
glucose levels during ITT in response to insulin compared to the
vehicle-treated group (Fig. 3C and F). It indicated that DC260126
could not alter glucose tolerance, but it improved insulin sensitivity
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066744.g002
in db/db mice after 3 weeks treatment. Meanwhile, the phase 2 of
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was obviously suppressed in
DC260126-treated db/db mice in comparison with vehicle group
(Fig. 3B and E). These data may provide evidence that DC260126
could reduce hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance via inhibition
of GPR40 in db/db mice.

DC260126 reduces proinsulin/insulin ratio in db/db mice
We had demonstrated that DC260126 could improve insulin
sensitivity in Zucker fatty rats [16]. Similar effects were found in
db/db mice (Fig. 2C and F). In long-term FFAs stimulation,
hyperinsulinemia perturbs the activity of prohormone convertase
1/3 (PC1/3), one of the key enzymes that convert proinsulin to
insulin [23]. Increased proinsulin-to-insulin (P/I) ratio is clarified
to be one marker of b-cells dysfunction, has been observed in type
2 diabetes [24,25,26]. We examined the level of proinsulin in
blood by ELISA, and immunohistochemistry was performed to
observe the relative amount of proinsulin in pancreatic islets. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, proinsulin immunoreactivity in islets and

the level of serum proinsulin were significantly increased in db/db
mice compared to lean mice, and DC260126 treated group
showed a lower value than vehicle treated db/db mice. Meanwhile,
the P/I ratio of DC260126 treated mice is declined in both
pancreatic islets and blood (Fig. 4A and C).
DC260126 reduces pancreatic b-cells apoptosis in db/db
mice
In obesity-related diabetes, a sustained elevation of plasma FFAs
leads to ER stress or oxidative stress in pancreatic b-cells, which
induce b-cell apoptosis [27,28]. The apoptotic rate of pancreatic
b-cells in each group was compared. Fig. 5A showed an obvious
increase in number of apoptotic b-cells in the islets of vehicle
treated db/db mice, which indicated that with the development of
hyperglycemia, the apoptotic pancreatic b-cells of db/db mice from
age of 9-week-old increased significantly. However, treatment of
DC260126 reduced the number of apoptotic b-cells significantly
(Fig. 5B), which suggested that long-term administration of
DC260126 could prevent pancreatic b-cells apoptosis.

Discussion
Chronically elevated levels of FFAs lead to b-cell dysfunction,
which is related to hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and glucose
intolerance [29,30]. As one of the FFA receptor, GPR40 is
implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and might
become a new potential drug target for the treatment of the disease
[8,11,31]. However, the role of GPR40 in the development of
diabetes remains controversial, since several animal model studies
showed inconsistent results [8,10,11].
Growing evidence indicated that some free fatty acids, such as
palmitate could mobilize the Ca2+ release and amplify GSIS in 
b-cells via GPR40, but the chronic palmitate treatment could induce
an increased risk of b-cell dysfunction [6,32,33]. Thus, a
therapeutic approach based on GPR40 antagonism for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes has been suggested [8,34]. But other
research showed opposite results that overexpression of GPR40
improved glucose tolerance in HFD diabetic mice [11]. And series
of GPR40-selective small-molecule agonists have been developed
for the purpose of type 2 diabetes medication in recent years
[5,12,35]. The different transgenosis methods or diets used in the
experiments might lead to these different observations of GPR40
agonism or antagonism [8,10,11].
However, the effects of GPR40 antagonists on type 2 diabetes
were studied less. We had observed the effect of DC260126 on
another hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance model Zucker
fatty rats [16]. There was no significant change on fasting blood
glucose or glucose tolerance between control and DC260126 treat
Zucker fatty rats, only the insulin sensitivity was improved and the
hyperinsulinemia was reduced [16]. However, as we known,
different from Zucker fatty rats, the diabetic phenomenon in db/db
DC260126 Prevents Iˆ2-Cells Dysfunction
mice developed quickly, nine-week-old db/db mice could generate
obviously hyperglycemia and insulin resistance [16,36]. To
investigate the effect of GPR40 antagonist DC260126 from 
pre-diabetes to diabetes in vivo, an obese diabetic db/db mice model
was considered suitable in this study. Because the activation of
GPR40 in intestine L cells could induce GLP-1 release and to
enhance insulin secretion, the db/db mice in this experiment were
given DC260126 via tail vein injection but not oral administration
to reduce the possible effect of inhibition of GLP-1 release via
antagonism of GPR40 in intestine. After 3 weeks administration of
DC260126, no obvious change was observed neither in blood
glucose nor lipids. We had reported that DC260126 could not
improve glucose tolerance in Zucker fatty rats [16], combined with
the results which Melkam et al. had proved in GPR40 knockout
mice [37], the therapy based on GPR40 antagonism might not be
effective enough to lower blood glucose levels. Nonetheless, these
results are inconsistent with which Steneberg et al. had described
[8]. We had also reported that DC260126 could protect MIN6 
b-cells from chronic palmitate induced apoptosis via decreased ER
stress [15]. Moreover, Abaraviciene et al. had also demonstrated
that the adverse effects of palmitate on cultured islets could be
counteracted by rosiglitazone, which could suppress 
GPR40-coupled signal transduction [34]. These studies suggested GPR40
antagonists should be useful in improving diabetic phenomenon.
Thus, the unexpected results that DC260126 could not improve
hyperglycemia may be explained by the pancreatic b-cells
generate a compensatory phase during the prediabetic state in
type 2 diabetes. During this phase, b-cell mass and insulin output
increase to adapt elevated FFA levels in db/db mice [18,38]. And
the sustained hyperinsulinemia could induce b-cell dysfunction
and related to insulin resistance [39]. GPR40 knockout mice could
prevent HFD induced-hyperinsulinemia to keep a lower insulin
level in the early stage of type 2 diabetes [8]. However, unlike the
sustained period of GPR40 knockout mice, in this experiment,
although the serum insulin levels were reduced, treatment of
DC260126 might start too late or last too short to fail to reverse
the process of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in db/db mice.
Meanwhile, the pharmacokinetics and the dose-response 
relationships of DC260126 might also contribute to this disappoint results.
Besides, although we chose tail vein injection for DC260126
administration to minish the possible effect of DC260126 on
GPR40 receptor in intestine, inhibition of GLP-1 release by
DC260126 might also contribute to unchanged blood glucose
level.
Interestingly, after 3 weeks administration of DC260126, an
obvious improvement of insulin sensitivity was found in
DC260126-treated db/db mice compared to vehicle-treated group.
We had also found that DC260126 could reduce insulin resistance
in Zucker fatty rats, and the phosphorylation level of AKT protein
in liver was increased in DC260126-treated mice [6]. However, as
known, GPR40 was less expressed in other tissues except pancreas
and enteroendocrine cells [40]. Therefore, we speculated that
DC260126 might have no direct effect on improving insulin
sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Steneberg et al. had mentioned
that the insulin sensitivity was improved in GPR40 knockout mice
under HFD-treated condition [8]. Hyperinsulinemia is highly
associated with insulin resistance in the development of T2D [39].
Recently study had also shown that limit peripheral 
hyperinsulinemia could provide benefit for the prevention of obesity and
insulin resistance [41]. GPR40 is thought to contribute to 
obesity-induce hyperinsulinemia as it is required for FFA-stimulated
insulin secretion. Thus, GPR40 knockout mice have a lower
insulin level and would not develop hyperinsulinemia compared to
normal mice on HFD-treatment [8]. In the current study,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

DC260126-treated mice got lower fasted serum insulin levels than
vehicle-treated mice, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
DC260126-treated db/db mice were also decreased than vehicle
group. It was in accord with the results that performed in GPR40
knockout mice in both Melkam et al. and Steneberg et al. reported
[8,37]. Therefore, like GPR40 knockout mice, DC260126 might
reduce insulin tolerance mainly through decreasing 
hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice. Moreover, it has been proved that in the
development of type 2 diabetes, hyperinsulinemia could induce an
increasing proinsulin-to-insulin (P/I) ratio, and the increased level
of proinsulin might be one of causes that induce insulin resistance
in hyperinsulinemia [24,25,26]. We found that in 
DC260126-treated mice, there was a lower P/I ratio in comparison with
vehicle-treated animals, demonstrating that the GPR40 antagonist
improves insulin sensitivity at least partially through decreasing P/
I ratio in db/db mice. Together, as both chronic hyperinsulinemia
and increased P/I ratio could lead to insulin resistance [8,24], the
possible mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity by DC260126
might be related to reduced P/I ratio and integral prevention of
compensatory development of insulin resistance caused by chronic
hyperinsulinemia.
Meanwhile, a chronic effect of FFAs mediated b-cell lipotoxicity
is mainly demonstrated by chronic fat accumulation in islets [4].

We speculated that inhibition of GPR40 by DC260126 could
partially protect pancreatic b-cells from FFAs induced lipotoxicity
and apoptosis. As we expected, treatment of DC260126 reduced
the number of apoptotic b-cells in db/db mice, which might get a
similar mechanism to the GPR40 antagonists did in MIN6 cells
[15]. Reduced apoptosis of pancreatic b-cells might provide
benefit for improving diabetic phenomenon, including insulin
resistance. However, unlike FFAs, GPR40 agonists only activate
GPR40 to amplify insulin secretion [12]. Thus, GPR40 agonists
might lead to less lipotoxicity in pancreatic b-cells.
In conclusion, although the GPR40 antagonist, DC260126
might not be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, our data
provided evidences that the theory under GPR40 antagonism for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes might be reasonable in the early
stage of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) mediates both acute and chronic effects of free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin
secretion. However, it remains controversial whether inhibition of GPR40 would be beneficial in prevention of type 2
diabetes. This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of DC260126, a small molecule antagonist of GPR40, on 
b-cell function following administration of 10 mg/kg dose of DC260126 to obese diabetic db/db mice. Oral glucose tolerance
test, glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin tolerance test were used to investigate the pharmacological effects of
DC260126 on db/db mice after 21-days treatment. Immunohistochemistry and serum biochemical analysis were also
performed in this study. Although no significant change of blood glucose levels was found in DC260126-treated mice,
DC260126 significantly inhibited glucose stimulated insulin secretion, reduced blood insulin level and improved insulin
sensitivity after 3 weeks administration in db/db mice. Moreover, DC260126 reduced the proinsulin/insulin ratio and the
apoptotic rate of pancreatic b-cells remarkably in DC260126-treated db/db mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (p,0.05,
n = 8). The results suggest that although DC260126 could not provide benefit for improving hyperglycemia, it could protect
against pancreatic b-cells dysfunction through reducing overload of b-cells, and it increases insulin sensitivity possibly via
alleviation of hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice.

insulin level and would not develop hyperinsulinemia compared to
normal mice on HFD-treatment [8]. In the current study,

DC260126-treated mice got lower fasted serum insulin levels than
vehicle-treated mice, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
DC260126-treated db/db mice were also decreased than vehicle
group. It was in accord with the results that performed in GPR40
knockout mice in both Melkam et al. and Steneberg et al. reported
[8,37]. Therefore, like GPR40 knockout mice, DC260126 might
reduce insulin tolerance mainly through decreasing 
hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice. Moreover, it has been proved that in the
development of type 2 diabetes, hyperinsulinemia could induce an
increasing proinsulin-to-insulin (P/I) ratio, and the increased level
of proinsulin might be one of causes that induce insulin resistance
in hyperinsulinemia [24,25,26]. We found that in 
DC260126-treated mice, there was a lower P/I ratio in comparison with
vehicle-treated animals, demonstrating that the GPR40 antagonist
improves insulin sensitivity at least partially through decreasing P/
I ratio in db/db mice. Together, as both chronic hyperinsulinemia
and increased P/I ratio could lead to insulin resistance [8,24], the
possible mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity by DC260126
might be related to reduced P/I ratio and integral prevention of
compensatory development of insulin resistance caused by chronic
hyperinsulinemia.
Meanwhile, a chronic effect of FFAs mediated b-cell lipotoxicity
is mainly demonstrated by chronic fat accumulation in islets [4].

Results
Effects of DC260126 on fasting serum insulin (FSI), fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) and other pharmacodynamic
biomarkers in db/db mice
After giving different dose of DC260126 to nine-week-old db/db
mice for 5 days, the FSI level was decreased dose-dependently.
And both 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg body weight could reduce FSI
level of db/db mice significantly (Fig. 1A). For long term
experiments, after giving 10 mg/kg body weight DC260126 to
6-week-old obese db/db male mice by tail vein injection once daily
for 3 weeks, no significant alteration in overall body weight gain
and daily food intake was found (Data not shown). And there was
no obvious difference in levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and
triglyceride (TG) (Data not shown). The FPG level was also similar
between DC260126 and vehicle group (Fig. 1B), indicating that 3
weeks administration of DC260126 in db/db mice could not
exhibit any significant change in levels of blood glucose or lipids.
However, the FSI level decreased significantly in 
DC260126-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2D).
HOMA-IR index was calculated, and the HOMA-IR was found
decreased in DC260126-treated mice compared to vehicle (Fig.
1C).
DC260126 inhibits compensatory increase of insulin
expression and b-cell mass
During the pre-diabetic state, a compensatory phase is induced
by peripheral insulin resistance in pancreatic b-cells. In this phase,
b-cell mass and insulin output were increased [21]. Finally,
constant increased secretion of insulin leads to b-cell exhaustion
[21,22]. Thus, preventing b-cells from overload might provide
benefit for preventing b-cell failure. We found that DC260126
could lower fasted serum insulin levels (Fig. 2D) and alter 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3B) in db/db mice. To investigate
the inhibitory effect of DC260126 on the compensatory increase of
insulin expression and pancreatic b-cell mass, 
immunohistochemistry staining for insulin was performed. An increased insulin
expression in the islets of Langerhans in db/db mice was found
compared with their lean mates. In DC260126 treated db/db mice,
however, insulin expression was decreased in islet compared with
vehicle treated db/db mice (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, a significant
increase was found in pancreatic b-cell mass in 9-week-old db/db
mice compared with their lean littermates, whereas the b-cell mass
of DC260126 group was effectively lower than vehicle treated db/
db mice after 3 weeks administration (Fig. 2C). These results
provide strong evidence that DC260126 could prevent b-cells
from overload to resist compensatory increasing in insulin
expression, b-cell mass and serum insulin levels of db/db mice
via inhibition of GPR40.

ITT were performed after 3 weeks administration of DC260126.
Although the glucose levels during OGTT in DC260126-treated
mice were similar to that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3A and D),
DC260126-treated mice showed an obvious decrease of blood
glucose levels during ITT in response to insulin compared to the
vehicle-treated group (Fig. 3C and F). It indicated that DC260126
could not alter glucose tolerance, but it improved insulin sensitivity

in db/db mice after 3 weeks treatment. Meanwhile, the phase 2 of
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was obviously suppressed in
DC260126-treated db/db mice in comparison with vehicle group
(Fig. 3B and E). These data may provide evidence that DC260126
could reduce hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance via inhibition
of GPR40 in db/db mice.

DC260126 reduces proinsulin/insulin ratio in db/db mice
We had demonstrated that DC260126 could improve insulin
sensitivity in Zucker fatty rats [16]. Similar effects were found in
db/db mice (Fig. 2C and F). In long-term FFAs stimulation,
hyperinsulinemia perturbs the activity of prohormone convertase
1/3 (PC1/3), one of the key enzymes that convert proinsulin to
insulin [23]. Increased proinsulin-to-insulin (P/I) ratio is clarified
to be one marker of b-cells dysfunction, has been observed in type
2 diabetes [24,25,26]. We examined the level of proinsulin in
blood by ELISA, and immunohistochemistry was performed to
observe the relative amount of proinsulin in pancreatic islets. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, proinsulin immunoreactivity in islets and

the level of serum proinsulin were significantly increased in db/db
mice compared to lean mice, and DC260126 treated group
showed a lower value than vehicle treated db/db mice. Meanwhile,
the P/I ratio of DC260126 treated mice is declined in both
pancreatic islets and blood (Fig. 4A and C).
DC260126 reduces pancreatic b-cells apoptosis in db/db
mice
In obesity-related diabetes, a sustained elevation of plasma FFAs
leads to ER stress or oxidative stress in pancreatic b-cells, which
induce b-cell apoptosis [27,28]. The apoptotic rate of pancreatic
b-cells in each group was compared. Fig. 5A showed an obvious
increase in number of apoptotic b-cells in the islets of vehicle
treated db/db mice, which indicated that with the development of
hyperglycemia, the apoptotic pancreatic b-cells of db/db mice from
age of 9-week-old increased significantly. However, treatment of
DC260126 reduced the number of apoptotic b-cells significantly
(Fig. 5B), which suggested that long-term administration of
DC260126 could prevent pancreatic b-cells apoptosis.

Mice

Introduction
Elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) levels are commonly
found in type 2 diabetes and are considered to be one of the most
important risk factors for type 2 diabetes [1,2,3]. The effects of
FFAs on pancreatic b-cells are complex and divergent [3]. Acute
administration of FFAs can amplify glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion (GSIS) of b-cells under normal circumstances, while
prolonged exposure to the saturated fatty acid impairs b-cells
function, which is known as lipotoxicity [4].
The G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) has been found
highly expressed in pancreatic b-cells in both human and rodents,
which could be activated by medium- and long-chain FFAs
[5,6,7]. GPR40 mediates both acute and chronic effects of FFAs
on insulin secretion and plays an important role in glucose
homeostasis [8]. FFAs could activate intracellular Ca2+ release via
GPR40, but the breakdown of Ca2+ homeostasis by sustained
elevation of FFA levels could trigger b-cell dysfunction and
apoptosis, which might be the mainly cause of FFA-induced
lipotoxicity [5,9]. Steneberg et al. firstly reported that GPR40
knockout mice were resistant to many effects of high-fatty-diet
(HFD), such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose
intolerance. Besides, the diabetic phenotype was observed in
transgenic mice overexpressing GPR40 in islets [8]. These results
suggest that inhibition of GPR40 may be useful for the prevention
and treatment of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. However, Lan
et al. reported that the deletion of GPR40 could not protect mice
from HFD-induced metabolic disease [10]. Nagasumi et al.
showed that overexpression of GPR40 in b-cells increased insulin
secretion and improved glucose tolerance in HFD-treated mice
[11]. Moreover, there is clear evidence that GPR40 agonist may
be useful in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia
[12,13]. These inconsistent results indicate that the role of
GPR40 in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes still needs further
studies.
In previous studies conducted with DC260126 (a novel class of
GPR40 antagonist), we have demonstrated that DC260126 could
protect MIN6 b-cells from palmitate-induced endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis [14,15]. And it could also reduce
hyperinsulinemia and improve insulin sensitivity in Zucker fatty
rats [16]. In this study, we investigated whether DC260126 is able
to prevent b-cells dysfunction in obese diabetic db/db mice. It is
found that hyperinsulinemia, proinsulin/insulin ratio and the
number of apoptotic b-cells were all reduced, and the insulin
resistance was improved following 21-days administration of
DC260126 in db/db mice.
