ABSTRACT
The effects of neonatal exposure to different doses of 
diethylstilbestrol (DES) on the reproductive functions of male rats at
adulthood were evaluated. Sprague-Dawley rats (5-8/group) 
received sc injections of 25 ml olive oil containing DES (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at a dose of 10 mg, 1 mg, 100 ng,
10 ng, or 1 ng per rat on alternate days from Postnatal Days 
2-12. Control animals received olive oil only. All animals were
allowed to develop until 83-91 days of age; however, when they
were 70 to 80 days old, four male rats each from the 10 mg, 1
mg, 100 ng, and control groups were cohabited with untreated
60- to 70-day-old females (1:1) for 12 days. At the end of 
cohabitation, both mated and unmated male rats were weighed,
and blood and tissue samples were collected and processed. 
Results revealed that although sperm motility patterns and sperm
morphology were adversely affected in the 10-mg group, other
reproductive parameters, including 1) daily sperm production
(DSP)/testis; 2) absolute and relative weights of the testis, 
epididymis, and seminal vesicle; and 3) sperm numbers in both
regions of the epididymis declined significantly in a dose-depen-
dent manner in the 10- and 1-mg groups. Conversely, in the ,1-
mg groups, none of these parameters (except DSP/testis and
weight of the epididymis in the 100-ng group, and sperm 
numbers in the epididymis of the 100- and 10-ng groups) was 
different from controls. Generally, plasma testosterone levels 
decreased in the 10- and 1-mg groups, FSH level increased in the
10-mg group, and prolactin and LH levels were unaltered. In the
fertility study, although each male in the 1-mg, 100-ng, and 
control groups produced a copulatory plug and impregnated a 
female, none could do so in the 10-mg group. The mean number
of pups per litter was reduced to eight in the 1-mg group, in
contrast to 15 each in the 100-ng and control groups. In 
conclusion, exposure of neonatal male rats to DES altered sperm
motility patterns, sperm fertility (as evident from the reduced
number of pups in the 1-mg group), and sexual behavior (as
evident from the absence of copulatory plugs in the 10-mg
group) and reduced weights of reproductive organs, DSP/testis,
and sperm numbers in the epididymis. Whether these 
alter-ations/reductions persist in older rats (6-8 mo of age) is under
investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Experimental studies involving ablation and/or x-irradi-
ation of the fetal testis [1], orchidectomy/hypophysectomy
with or without testosterone substitution [2, 3], ligation of
efferent ductules [4, 5], and in vitro culture [6] have 
established that androgens are essential for development of male
reproductive organs, sperm production, and sperm 
maturation. Conversely, the role of estrogen in male 
reproduction remains unclear, although it is known that the rete fluid
contains a high concentration of estrogens [7] and that both
estrogen receptors (ER), ERa and ERb, are widely 
distributed in male reproductive organs of various species [8, 
re-view], including rats [9-11]. Recent studies reporting 
infertility in genetically altered mice lacking the aromatase
enzyme [12, 13] or estrogen receptor a [14] and describing
poor semen quality in male patients with a defective ERa
gene [15] or aromatase gene [16] have indicated that 
deprivation of estrogen or its receptors impairs male 
reproductive functions. Similarly, an excessive exposure of estrogen
leads to reproductive abnormalities. A higher incidence of
retained testes, atrophic testes, sperm abnormalities, and 
epididymal cysts has been reported in some male offspring of
women who were exposed to estrogenic compounds during
pregnancy [17]. Similar disorders, as well as lower fertility,
have been found in laboratory animals that were treated
neonatally/perinatally with estrogens [18-21].
It is interesting that both deprivation of and excessive
exposure to estrogens can lead to reproductive disorders,
including infertility. Adding to the interest are recent 
observations that estrogens at very low doses can enlarge the
prostate gland, whereas higher doses have the opposite 
effect [22, 23]. This interest is further heightened by reports
of decreasing sperm counts in men over a period of decades
[24, 25] and of a possible link between an exposure to
estrogenic chemicals and an increase in the incidence of
reproductive abnormalities in men [21] and wildlife [26,
27].
Hence it is clear from the above review that estrogens
play an important role in male reproduction, but their 
mechanisms of action in reproductive physiology or in inducing
reproductive abnormalities remain unclear. By treating 
Wis-tar rats neonatally with different doses of diethylstilbestrol
(DES), Sharpe et al. [28] and others [29-31] have reported
a dose-dependent decrease in testis weight and germ cell
volume/testis and an increase in apoptotic index of germ
cells at adulthood, implying a long-lasting effect of 
neonatal exposure to estrogens. Furthermore, fertility in these
rats was reduced to zero with higher doses (10 mg and 1
mg rat21 day21 on alternate days from Postnatal Days 
2-12) and to 50% with the lowest dose (10 ng), the dose that
had a stimulatory effect on spermatogenesis at prepuberty
and did not affect testis weight at adulthood [30].

ingly, the latter dose of DES falls within a range that leads
to an increase in prostate weight of adult CF-1 mice whose
mothers received DES (2 ng/g body weight) from gestation
Days 11
Considering the potential implications of the above 
results for human health, the aim of the present study is to
determine effects of neonatal estrogen exposure on male
reproductive parameters at adulthood in Sprague-Dawley
rats, a strain of rat that is commonly used to assess 
toxicological effects of endocrine disruptors and is genetically
less sensitive
to estrogens than other strains of rats [33, 34].
In addition, this study broadened its scope by including
epididymal parameters, such as numbers, morphology, and
motility patterns of sperm in the epididymis, that have not
been well characterized following neonatal estrogen 
exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Treatments
Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley female
rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley,
Indianapolis, IN)
were housed individually and observed twice daily for
delivery. Animals were maintained under controlled conditions at 22-238C
ambient temperature, 55%-60% relative humidity, 12L:12D cycle, and
were supplied with water and feed (Rodent Chow 5001; Purina Mills, St.
Louis, MO) ad libitum. Within
24 h of delivery, the litter size
was 
standardized
to eight pups per dam, with
as many as eight males, if possible.
Beginning from the second day (Day
1 is the day of birth) and ending
on
Day 12, neonatal pups (five to eight males per group, except four males
in the
1-ng group) received subcutaneously 25 ml of olive oil containing
DES (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO)
at a dose of 10 mg, 1 mg, 100 ng,
10
ng, or 1 ng rat21 day21 on alternate days. The control animals were
treated the
same way except that they received olive oil only. This protocol
of
treatment is essentially similar to that reported for Wistar rats [29, 30].
Pups were weaned on Postnatal Day 22 and were observed regularly until
used for mating
at 70-80 days of age and/or necropsied at 83-91 days of
age. All animal procedures
were approved by the IACUC at Tuskegee
University.
Body and Organ Weights
Beginning with Week 1, body weight
was recorded every week until
the day of necropsy and weight gain/loss for each period was calculated.
The weights of the testis, caput and corpus of the epididymis, cauda of
the epididymis, and seminal vesicle (including coagulating gland) of both
sides
were recorded for each animal, and relative weights (weight of the
organ/100 g body weight)
were calculated. Testes and epididymides were
trimmed of fat prior
to recording their weights. After weighing, testis and
epididymis of the right side
were processed for histopathology, and those
from the left side
were frozen at 2808C until thawed for sperm counts.
Sperm Numbers in the Testis and the Epididymis
Methodology for determining the number of homogenization-resistant
spermatids/sperm in the testis, caput and corpus of the epididymis, and
cauda of the epididymis was previously described from our laboratory
[35]. Briefly, the testis was thawed, the capsule was detached and weighed,
and the parenchyma was homogenized in 50 ml of PBS using a Waring
laboratory blender (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) that was set at low
speed. The homogenate was filtered through a metal sieve, and a 200 ml
aliquot of the filtrate was mixed with 100 ml of PBS and 200 ml of 0.6%
trypan blue, which stains elongated spermatids. An 8.5 ml aliquot of the
latter mixture was then used to determine the average number of 
homog-enization-resistant spermatids/sperm in each sample in duplicate using a
hemocytometer. Daily sperm production (DSP) was calculated by dividing
the total number of spermatids/sperm per testis or per gram of testicular
parenchyma (testis weight minus weight of the capsule) by 6.1 days, the
duration of step 19 spermatids in the seminiferous epithelial cycle [36].
Sperm Motility Parameters
Methodologies for collection of sperm from the cauda of the right
epididymis and for analyzing sperm motion parameters using a 
computer-to 17 [32].
GOYAL ET AL.
assisted semen analysis system (Integrated Visual Optical Systems, 
Hamilton Thorn Research, Beverly, MA) were the same as previously described
from our laboratory [35]. Briefly, 200 sperm from each animal were 
analyzed for the following motion parameters: percentage of motile sperm
(MSP), percentage of progressively motile sperm (PMP), average path
velocity (VAP), straight line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL),
lateral head displacement (ALH), straightness (STR) ([straight line 
veloc-ity/average path velocity] 3 100), and linearity (LIN) ([straight line 
ve-locity/curvilinear velocity] 3 100). Prior to recordings of sperm motility
parameters, the instrument was optimized and the analysis was done using
the settings described previously from our laboratory [35]. Sperm were
considered motile if average path velocity exceeded 20 mm/sec and
con-
sidered progressively motile if average path velocity exceeded 100 mm/
sec. All procedures were performed at 378C, and all equipment that came
in contact with sperm was prewarmed to and maintained at 378C.
Sperm Morphology
An aliquot of sperm suspension used for motility analysis was diluted
with formaldehyde, and a 10 ml of the diluted sample was examined with
a phase contrast microscope. Two hundred sperm from each animal were
evaluated and classified as follows: normal, head defect, middle piece
defect, principal piece defect, proximal droplet, distal droplet, and 
detached head. In sperm with two
or more defects, only the defect affecting
its
more proximal portion was recorded [35].
Hormonal Measurement
One blood sample
was collected from the heart of each animal prior
to necropsy, and plasma
was frozen at 2208C until assayed. LH, FSH,
and prolactin
were measured using materials obtained through NHPP,
NIDDK, and Dr. A.F. Parlow (antibodies: NIDDK-anti-rLH-S-11, 
NIDDK-anti-rFSH-S-11, NIDDK-anti-rPRL-S-9; reference standards: 
NIDDK-rLH-RP-3, NIDDK-rFSH-RP-2, NIDDK-rPRL-RP-3; tracers: 
NIDDK-rLH-I-10, NIDDK-rFSH-I-9, NIDDK-rPRL-I-6). The sensitivities of the
assays were calculated to be 0.3, 2.3, and 0.4 ng/ml for LH, FSH, and
prolactin, respectively. Testosterone
was measured using a Coat-a-Count
testosterone radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los 
Angeles, CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The sensitivity of the
assay
was calculated to be 0.2 ng/ml. All samples were quantified in a
single assay for each hormone with intraassay coefficients of variation of
6%, 9%, 7%, and 7% for LH, FSH, prolactin, and testosterone, 
respectively.
Histopathology of the Testis, Rete Testis, Efferent
Ductules, and Epididymis
Testis. Three- to 5-mm thick slices of tissues from the middle region
of the right testis were fixed for 24 h in 4% (w:v) paraformaldehyde in
PBS (pH 7.4). The reason for selecting paraformaldehyde, instead of
Bouin fluid,
as a fixative was to use these tissues not only for histology
but also for immunocytochemistry of steroid receptors (topic of another
manuscript), which, in our hands, is better illustrated by fixing tissues in
paraformaldehyde [37]. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 mm
thickness, stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), counterstained with 
he-matoxylin, and examined with a light microscope. In two to three random
paraffin sections from each animal, 20 cross-sections of stages VII and
VIII seminiferous tubules each from the control, 10-mg, and 1-mg groups
(n 5 5 for each group) was measured blindly for tubular diameter (basal
lamina to basal lamina), epithelial height (basal lamina to neck of 
elongated spermatids), and luminal diameter using a computer-assisted image
analysis system.
Rete testis, efferent ductules, and epididymis. The proximal end of the
testis containing rete testis (2-3 mm thick); the entire efferent ductules
(interposed between the testis and the epididymis); and the caput, 
including initial segment (cut in the middle into two halves), and cauda (cut in
the middle into two halves) regions of the epididymis were fixed and
processed as described above for the testis, except that the proximal testis
from the control, 10-mg, and 1-mg groups was serially sectioned. Every
20th serial section, with as many as 15 sections spanning a distance of
1.5-2 mm, was examined for changes in luminal diameter of the rete testis,
since it is known that neonatal estrogen exposure causes distension of its
lumen [31, 38, 39]. In addition, in two to three random paraffin sections
from each animal, 15 tubular cross-sections each from the proximal and
distal regions of the efferent ductules and the initial segment, caput, and
cauda regions of the epididymis were measured for tubular diameter (basal
lamina to basal lamina), epithelial height, and luminal diameter using a
the lower dose groups revealed minimal to no adverse effects on 
reproductive parameters studied here. Digital images of PAS-stained paraffin
sections were captured using a Leitz Orthoplan microscope (Vashaw 
Scientific, Inc., Norcross, GA) and Kodak Microscopy Documentation 
System 290 (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY), and were assembled
using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (MicroWarehouse, Norwalk, CT).
Fertility. Four 70- to 80-day-old male rats each from the 10 mg, 1 mg,
100 ng, and control groups were transferred to a mating cage floored with
a wire mesh grid and cohabited with untreated, 60- to 70-day-old female
rats (1:1) for 12 day. Cages were checked for the presence of copulatory
plugs, and vaginal washings were evaluated for the presence of sperm
everyday. Females with positive plugs and/or sperm
were separated from
males and
were killed at 15-18 day of pregnancy. Both uteri were removed
and examined for the number of live fetuses and implantations. In addition,
both ovaries were removed and the number of corpora lutea was counted.
Data were analyzed to determine the effects of neonatal estrogen exposure
on the number of live embryos per litter, preimplantation loss (difference
between the number of corpora lutea and the number of implantation sites
expressed as per number of corpora lutea), and postimplantation loss (dif-
ference between the number of implantation sites and the number of live
fetuses expressed as per number of implantation sites). In addition, the
conception time, the interval between the first day of cohabitation and the
day of plug and/or sperm,
was recorded for each female.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat statistical 
software (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). One-way analyses of variance were
utilized on all parameters, except the weekly body weight, which was
analyzed by two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. 
Treatment groups with means significantly different (P # 0.05) from controls
were identified using the Dunnett test. When data were not distributed
normally, or heterogeneity of variance was identified, analyses were 
performed on transformed data or ranked data; however, arithmetic means
and SEM are presented in tables and figures.
RESULTS
Body Weight
The final body weight at Postnatal Week 12-13 was 
similar in the #1-mg groups and controls, but it was almost
7% lower (P # 0.05) in the 10-mg group than in controls
(Table 1). Similarly, the mean weekly body weight was
lower throughout development in the 10-mg group only, but
the decrease was not significant (P # 0.05) during the first
5 wk of age (Fig. 1). A spurt in growth, characterized by
a steep gain in weekly body weight, started at 5 wk and
continued through 9 wk of age, regardless of the treatment.
During this period, a control pup gained an average of 195
g of weight, in contrast to 175 g in the 10-mg group (Fig.
1). The two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures
identified significant effects of age, treatment, and a 
treatment by age interaction.
ESTROGEN EXPOSURE ON MALE REPRODUCTION
2083NEONATAL
Both absolute (Fig. 2) and relative weights (Table 1) of
the testis, caput and corpus of the epididymis, cauda of the
epididymis, and seminal vesicle responded in a dose-de-
pendent manner, with no difference from control observed
in the 10-ng group and the maximum decrease observed in
the 10-mg group. Conversely, the relative weight of the 
testis and the cauda of the epididymis was significantly (P #
0.05) higher in the 1-ng group (Table 1). Within the 10-mg
group, the level of weight loss differed among organs. It
was much more pronounced in the seminal vesicle (85%)
and both regions of the epididymis (42%-50%) than in the
testis (25%).
Number of Sperm in the Testis and Epididymis
The total number of homogenization-resistant sperm per
testis was significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent 
manner, by almost 48%, 35%, and 24% in the 10-mg, 1-mg, and
100-ng groups, respectively (Fig. 3). However, the 14% 
reduction in the mean observed in the 10-ng group was not
significantly different from controls. Unlike sperm numbers
per testis, the DSP per gram of testicular parenchyma (in-
ed neonatally with 10 mg of DES. *Significant differences from controls
(P # 0.05). Control, n 5 7; 10 mg, n 5 6.
dicator for efficiency of spermatogenesis) was not altered
in the 10-mg to 10-ng groups (Fig. 3). Both mean values
for sperm numbers per testis and DSP per gram of testicular
parenchyma were higher in the 1-ng group (114% and
107% of controls, respectively), but they could not be 
distinguished from controls.
Sperm numbers in the epididymis were dramatically low
in the 10-mg group and, comparatively, the decrease was
much higher in the cauda (92%) than in the caput and 
corpus (72%; Fig. 4). Conversely, reductions in the 1-mg to
10-ng groups, although significant, were similar for both
regions of the epididymis and ranged from 20% to 40%
depending on the dose. Unlike in the higher dose groups,
sperm numbers in the 1-ng group did not significantly differ
from that of controls in either region of the epididymis.
Computer-Assisted Sperm Motility Parameters
Among various motility parameters, MSP, PMP, STR
(percentage), and LIN (percentage) were significantly 
decreased in the 10-mg group (Fig. 5). Of all these parameters,
the maximum effect was observed in PMP, which was 
reduced to 35% of controls. None of the motility parameters
was different from controls in the #1-mg groups, except
VCL (micrometers per second), which
was significantly
higher in the 1-mg group (Fig. 5).
Sperm Morphology
The incidence of abnormal sperm was similar in the #1-
mg groups and controls, but it was significantly higher in
the 10-mg group (Table 2). Of various sperm abnormalities
affecting the head, middle piece, or principal piece, the 
misshapen head and bent middle piece were most frequently
encountered and constituted 78% and 10% of abnormal
sperm, respectively, in the 10-mg group. Conversely, the
incidence of sperm with retained distal cytoplasmic droplet
was significantly lower in the 10-mg group (Table 2).
Hormones
The mean plasma concentration of testosterone was 
significantly lower in the 10-mg and 1-mg groups (25%-30%
of controls), but was not different from controls in the 
lower dose groups (Fig. 6). Conversely, the mean FSH level
was almost fourfold higher in the 10-mg group but could
not be distinguished from controls in the other groups. 
Neither prolactin nor LH was significantly altered in any of
the treated groups (Fig. 6).

2085NEONATAL
Histopathology of the Testis, Rete Testis, Efferent
Ductules, and Epididymis
Histological examination of the testis did not reveal any
evidence of degeneration of germ cells and/or retention of
spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium, regardless of the
dose of DES or the stage of seminiferous epithelial cycle
(Fig. 7, A and B). With the exception of seminiferous 
epithelial height in the 10-mg group, mean measurements for
the epithelial height, luminal diameter, and tubular diameter
of stages VII and VIII tubules did not significantly differ
between controls and treated groups (Table 3).
An examination of serial sections of the rete testis 
revealed that it consisted of a sac-like structure interrupted
by trabeculae, which gave the rete an appearance of a maze
of interconnecting tubules. The intratesticular sac of the rete
was up to 1.7 mm deep under the capsule of the testis, and
its luminal diameter, along the length, was highly variable
within, as well as between, animals both in the control and
treated groups, varying from 20 mm in some sections to
400 mm in other sections. Compared with controls, there
was no morphological evidence of dilation of lumen or 
accumulation of sperm in any of the treated groups. On the
other hand, the mean luminal diameter of the distal efferent
ductules was increased by 60% (P # 0.05) and that of the
proximal efferent ductules by 30% in the 10-mg group, 
although the latter increase was not significantly different
from controls (Table 3). However, it should be noted that
the luminal diameter of proximal tubules varied widely not
only among tubules within the same animal, but also along
the length. Generally, tubules nearer their origin from the
extratesticular rete tend to have a larger luminal diameter
than those present distally. The general morphology of 
ef-2086
ferent ductules, including epithelial height, did not alter as
a result of neonatal estrogen treatment except in the 10-mg
group, where three of the six animals had focal, 
mononu-clear infiltration in the epithelium, peritubular tissue, and/
or lumen of some of the ductules. In two of the latter three
animals, the epithelium in some tubules was hypertrophied
GOYAL ET AL.
and the lumen contained PAS-positive material. In addition,
the lumen, at certain points along the length, was partially
obstructed by a cellular, tongue-like structure. The latter, in
serial sections, was found to be continuous with the lining
epithelium (Fig. 7, C-F). Neither lymphocytic infiltration
nor epithelial hypertrophy was observed in the efferent

ductules of control or #1-mg groups (n 5 5 for each group,
except n 5 4 in the 1-ng group).
None of the morphometric features in the initial segment
and caput of the epididymis was different from that of 
controls in the 10-mg or 1-mg groups (Table 3). However, both
luminal and tubular diameters were significantly lower and
epithelial height was significantly higher in the cauda 
epididymis of the 10-mg group (Table 3).
Fertility
Fertility-related parameters studied were fertility index,
presence of copulatory plugs and/or sperm in vaginal 
washing, pups per litter, and pre- and postimplantation losses.
Although all females mated with males in the control, 
1-mg, or 100-ng groups had copulatory plugs and produced
pups (fertility index 100%), neither copulatory plugs nor
pups were present in females cohabited with males of the
10-mg group (fertility index 0%; Table 4). The mean 
number of live pups per litter was 14.5 and 14.8 in the control
and 100-ng groups, respectively, in contrast to 7.8 in the
1-mg group. The mean preimplantation loss (difference 
between the number of corpora lutea and the number of 
implantation sites expressed as per number of corpora lutea)
was 49% for the 1 mg group, in contrast to 12% and 6%
for the 100-ng and control groups, respectively. The mean
values for both of the above parameters in the 1-mg group
reflect heterogenous responses among animals. For 
example, although females mated with two males of the group
had very few pups (2 or 3 per litter), those mated with the
other two males of the group had as many pups as in the
control and lower dose groups (13 per litter). Similarly, the
preimplantation loss for the first two females was 
exceedingly high, whereas that for the latter two females was 
essentially similar to that of the control and lower dose
groups. The mean postimplantation loss (difference 
between the number of implantation sites and the number of
live fetuses expressed as per number of implantation sites)
for the 1-mg, 100-ng, and control groups was 9.5%, 3.6%,
and 3.3%, respectively. The mean conception time (interval
between the day of cohabitation and the day of presence of
plug/sperm) was 3.5, 3.0, and 5.3 days in the control, 
100-ng, and 1-mg groups, respectively (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
This study, using different dose regimens of DES (10
mg, 1 mg, 100 ng, 10 ng, and 1 ng) determined the effects
of neonatal estrogen exposure on adult reproduction in male
Sprague-Dawley rats and compared them with those 
previously reported in Wistar rats (28-30]. Results of the study
provided clear evidence for the first time that neonatal 
estrogen exposure compromised sperm morphology, sperm
motility patterns, and sperm numbers in the adult 
epididymis. In addition, they confirmed earlier reports that 
indicated significant changes in weights of the testis, 
epididymis, and seminal vesicle; sperm production; plasma 
testosterone concentration; and/or fertility at maturity following
neonatal and/or prenatal exposure to estrogenic compounds
in rats [28, 40-43], mice [18, 19, 44], hamsters [45], and
rabbits [46].
Generally, adverse effects observed in Sprague-Dawley
rats were maximal in the 10-mg group, moderate in the 
1-mg group, and minimal to absent in the lower dose groups.
Similar dose-dependent effects were also reported in Wistar
rats, but the level of effects on the testis and fertility 
differed markedly between the two strains of rats. For 
example, Wistar rats treated neonatally with 10 mg of DES had
degeneration of germ cells and Sertoli cell-only 
seminiferous tubules in 60% of animals, and atrophic, necrotic,
and/or cryptorchid testis in 15% of animals at adulthood
[28]. Conversely, none of these phenotypes was observed
in Sprague-Dawley rats, regardless of the dose. Although
none of the Wistar rats in the 1-mg group and only 50% in
the 10-ng group sired pups [30], all Sprague-Dawley rats
did so in the 1-mg and 100-ng groups. Hence, these 
comparisons suggest that Sprague-Dawley rats may be less 
sensitive than Wistar rats to disruptive actions of estrogens on
reproductive functions. Previous studies have also shown
that Sprague-Dawley rats and/or CD-1 mice are much more
resistant to estrogenic compounds than other strains [33,
34, 47]. These differences in susceptibility to estrogenic
compounds signify the importance of understanding genetic
mechanisms that are responsible for differential responses.

An important finding of the study was the marked 
differences in weight loss among reproductive organs in the
10-mg group. Whereas the relative weight decreased by
25% in the testis, it decreased by almost 50% in the caput
and corpus or the cauda of the epididymis and by 85% in
the seminal vesicle. These results are in agreement with
those of a recent study that reported an 80% reduction in
the weight of the seminal vesicle, in contrast to 20% in the
testis, of adult Sprague-Dawley rats that were treated 
neonatally with estradiol benzoate at a rate of 1500 mg/kg body
weight (similar to 10 mg/rat in the present study) [47]. 
Interestingly, similar differential response in weight loss of
reproductive organs was also observed in rats following
exposure to estrogenic compounds during adulthood in rats
[35, 48-50]. Reasons for this differential response are not
clear, but differences in susceptibility to estrogens and/or
testosterone may play some role since both estrogen and
androgen receptors are present in the testis, epididymis, and
seminal vesicle [10, 51-55], and testosterone is reduced in
adult animals following neonatal estrogen exposure [28, 29,
40].
It is well established that prenatal and/or neonatal 
exposure to estrogenic compounds leads to smaller testes and
lower sperm production in rodents [21, 28, 41, 56]. Our
observations of significant, dose-dependent reductions in
testis weight and DSP per testis (total number of sperm per
testis/6.1 day) in the 10-mg, 1-mg, and 100-ng groups are
in agreement with the above concept. However, despite a
dose-dependent decrease in DSP per testis, the DSP per
gram of testicular parenchyma did not differ between the
control and treated animals or between treated groups.
These results imply that neonatal estrogen exposure did not
perturb efficiency of spermatogenesis in Sprague-Dawley
rats, an interpretation supported by the lack of any 
morphological evidence of degeneration of germ cells, retention
of spermatids, and/or phagocytosis of spermatids in the
seminiferous epithelium, regardless of the stage of tubules
or the dose of DES. This is further supported by no adverse
effect on seminiferous epithelial height, luminal diameter,
or tubular diameter of stages VII and VIII tubules, the 
stages where spermiation occurs and which are 
testosterone-dependent [57, 58]. Contrary to these results, Wistar rats
treated neonatally with DES at a rate of 10 mg/rat had more
than a fourfold increase in germ cell apoptosis and more
than a twofold increase in the lumen volume of 
seminiferous tubules than controls at adulthood [29]. According to
these authors, the retrograde buildup of testicular fluid in
the lumen of seminiferous tubules, as a consequence of
maldevelopment of the rete testis and efferent ductules [31,
39], may account for increased germ cell degeneration and
thus reduced efficiency of spermatogenesis in adult Wistar
rats treated neonatally with estrogens. If this were true, then
the lack of morphological evidence of dilation of the rete
testis and/or lumen of the seminiferous tubules in the 
present study goes hand in hand with the normal efficiency of
spermatogenesis at adulthood in neonatally estrogenized
Sprague-Dawley rats and thus again points to a genetic 
difference in susceptibility to estrogens between these two
strains of rats.
The present observations of reduced testosterone are in
agreement with those of previous studies, which also 
reported lower testosterone in adult animals as a consequence
of estrogen treatment of neonatal animals [28-30, 40, 59].
Interestingly, this decline occurred without any alteration
in LH concentration and thus suggests permanent changes
in functions of Leydig cells, which may include reductions
GOYAL ET AL.
in LH receptor concentration, sensitivity of Leydig cells to
LH, and/or enzymes associated with testosterone synthesis.
Testosterone decline not involving the negative feedback
inhibition of LH was also described in rats exposed to 
estrogens during adulthood [35, 42, 50] and may be attributed
to a direct inhibitory effect of estrogens on enzymes 
involved in the production of testosterone [60, 61].
Another important finding of the present study was the
significant, dose-dependent reductions in sperm numbers in
the epididymis, which can be partly attributed to lower 
daily sperm production. However, comparatively the level of
reduction in epididymal sperm numbers was 
disproportionately higher in the 10- and 1-mg groups, especially the 
former. For example, although daily sperm production per 
testis was decreased by 48%, sperm numbers were decreased
by 72% in the caput and corpus and by 92% in the cauda
of the epididymis in the 10-mg group. A similar 
disproportionately greater decline in epididymal sperm numbers was
also previously reported in rats [35] and mice [62] exposed
to estrogen during adulthood and was attributed to 
accelerated sperm transport in the epididymis [62].
Despite decreased sperm production and epididymal
sperm numbers in the 10-mg, 1-mg, and 100-ng groups,
morphology and motility patterns of sperm were adversely
affected only in the 10-mg group, suggesting higher 
resistance of these phenotypes in lower dose groups. Since the
higher percentage of abnormalities affected the head and
middle piece of sperm, it is likely that these defects 
originated during the metamorphic stage of spermatogenesis 
because this stage involves modeling of the head and tail of
spermatozoa [57]. There are few studies that have examined
effects of estrogen on motility and/or morphology of sperm.
The percentage of motile sperm was significantly reduced
in adult rats treated with ethinyl estradiol after 1 wk of
treatment [50]. A higher percentage of decapitated and/or
abnormal sperm was reported after estradiol administration
to adult rats [49, 63, 64]. Recently, we reported that of all
motility parameters, the percentage of sperm with 
progressive motility was the most sensitive parameter to estrogen
exposure in adult animals. It was reduced to less than 20%
of controls in rats treated with DES at a rate of 40 mg to
1 mg rat21 day21 for 12 days and to 40% of controls in the
8-mg group [35]. Similarly, in the present study progressive
forward motility was most severely affected and was 
reduced to 35% of controls in the 10-mg group.
Unlike inhibitory effects observed in the testis with
higher doses of DES, the relative weight of the testis was
significantly increased by 10% in the 1-ng group, indicating
a stimulatory effect of the lowest dose of DES used in the
present study. This stimulatory effect was coupled with a
similar percentage increase in DSP per testis or per gram
of testicular parenchyma, but both increases were not 
significantly different from controls. These results are 
essentially in accord with those of a recent study in which
Sprague-Dawley rats treated neonatally with estradiol 
benzoate had larger testes at postnatal Days 35 and 90 with
lower doses, whereas the reverse was the case with higher
doses [47]. Similarly, another study reported stimulatory
effects of estrogen exposure on prepubertal 
spermatogenesis, where spermatocyte nuclear volume per Sertoli cell 
nuclear volume was significantly increased in rats treated 
neonatally with low doses of DES [30]. Comparable 
stimulatory effects were also reported on the prostate weight of
rats treated with low doses of estrogens neonatally [23] or
prenatally [22, 32]. The low-dose stimulatory effects of 
estrogen on adult testes of rats estrogenized neonatally can
result from a direct effect of estrogen on Sertoli cells and/
or germ cells since both cell types have been shown to
express estrogen receptors at all stages of development [65-
67].
It is well established that more than 90% of testicular
fluid in rodents is absorbed in the efferent ductules [68],
and a disturbance in this function can lead to dilation of
the efferent ductules and rete testis, which is probably the
cause of infertility seen in mutant mice lacking ERa [8].
Several studies from Hess et al. [9, 10] have demonstrated
that estrogens are important in testicular fluid absorption
because efferent ductules contain higher concentration of
ERa compared with other segments of the male 
reproductive tract. In addition, epithelial cells lining the efferent
ductules are shorter and contain less developed endocytotic
apparatus (shorter microvilli and fewer pinocytotic vesicles
and canaliculi) in ERa knockout mice than in wild mice of
the same age [69, 70], and antiestrogen ICI 182 780 causes
dilation of the rete testis and efferent ductules [71]. 
Ironically, an overexposure of estrogen during the neonatal 
period is also shown to cause dilation of the rete testis and/
or efferent ductules in Wistar rats [31, 38, 39]. Considering
the potential functional significance of these findings for
human health, we wanted to determine whether neonatally
estrogenized Sprague-Dawley rats also show dilations of
the intratesticular rete testis or efferent ductules at 
adulthood. In an examination of serial sections, the luminal 
diameter of the rete testis varied widely from 20 to 400 mm
within the same animal, as well as between animals, but
there
was no evidence of its unusual dilation in any of the
treated groups.
Unlike the rete testis, efferent ductules, especially distal
ductules, had an increased luminal diameter in the 10-mg
group compared with controls, suggestive of a defect in the
absorption of testicular fluid. It will be of interest to 
investigate whether dilation of the efferent ductules will 
accentuate and progressively lead to distension of the lumen in
the rete testis, with time, in older animals. Regardless, the
above alterations in efferent ductules, along with 
observations of leukocytic infiltration in three of the six animals
of the 10-mg group, indicate efferent ductules
as the 
primary site for estrogen action in the male reproductive
tract.
A similar increase in the luminal diameter was also reported
in the efferent ductules of adult Wistar rats that were treated
with estrogens neonatally [31]; however, Fisher et al. [31],
to our knowledge, did not make any distinction between
proximal and distal regions of the efferent ductules.
The final parameter studied
was the effect of neonatal
DES treatment on fertility-related parameters and their 
relationships, if any, with testicular, epididymal, and/or 
behavioral disorders. Observations that all males in the 1-mg
and 100-ng groups sired pups, but none of the males in the
10-mg group did, indicate that neonatal DES exposure
at
the highest dose used in this study was effective in inducing
infertility in 100% of males. The absence of copulatory
plugs or sperm in vaginal washings in females mated with
these males suggests that infertility probably resulted from
a compromise in sexual behavior. Additional observations
of fewer pups per litter and higher preimplantation loss in
the 1-mg group suggest compromised sperm fertility, 
although this interpretation deserves caution since two of the
four males sired normal numbers of pups per litter (13
each). Similar to our results, Wistar male rats treated 
neonatally with 10-mg of DES
were infertile, and females 
mated with them did not have copulatory plugs; however, 
unlike our results, all Wistar male rats in the 1-mg group did
ESTROGEN EXPOSURE ON MALE REPRODUCTION

not mate [30]. The latter authors did not measure fertility
in the 100-ng group, but 50% of males in the 10-ng group
did not mate. These similarities and differences in fertility
between Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats indicate that 
neonatal estrogen exposure can change the sexual behavior of
rats, but the threshold for this change is lower in Wistar
rats than Sprague-Dawley rats.
The estrogen-induced depressed sexual behavior, as 
evident from the absence or reduced number of copulatory
plugs, has been reported previously in rats treated with 
estrogens neonatally [40] or during adulthood [35, 48].
Whether the observed decline in plasma testosterone level
in the 10-mg group played a role in altering sexual behavior
is doubtful since a similar decline (reduced to 30% of 
con-trols) was also observed in the 1-mg group, which exhibited
normal sexual behavior. Hence it appears that neonatal DES
treatment in the 10-mg group altered the sexual 
masculinization of the central nervous system that is necessary for
adult male sexual behavior [72].
In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence
of altered reproductive functions, including motility and
morphology of sperm, fertility, and sexual behavior, in adult
Sprague-Dawley rats that were neonatally treated with
DES. Further, a comparison of present results with those
already published in Wistar rats, using similar dose 
regimens, suggests genetic differences in susceptibility to 
estrogens between strains of rats.
