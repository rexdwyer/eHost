5. Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that supplementation of chitosan in the diet can effectively mitigate
the increased body weight, hypercholesterolemia, and increased insulin resistance induced by HF-diet
feeding in rats. These findings suggest that chitosan possesses the ability to improve the impairment
of glucose and lipid metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term feeding of chitosan on
plasma glucose and lipids in rats fed a high-fructose (HF) diet (63.1%). Male Sprague-Dawley
rats aged seven weeks were used as experimental animals. Rats were divided into three groups:
(1) normal group (normal); (2) HF group; (3) chitosan + HF group (HF + C). The rats were fed the
experimental diets and drinking water ad libitum for 21 weeks. The results showed that chitosan
(average molecular weight was about 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and degree of deacetylation was about
89.8%) significantly decreased body weight, paraepididymal fat mass, and retroperitoneal fat mass
weight, but elevated the lipolysis rate in retroperitoneal fats of HF diet-fed rats. Supplementation
of chitosan causes a decrease in plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-6,
and leptin, and an increase in plasma adiponectin. The HF diet increased hepatic lipids. However,
intake of chitosan reduced the accumulation of hepatic lipids, including total cholesterol (TC) and
triglyceride (TG) contents. In addition, chitosan elevated the excretion of fecal lipids in HF diet-fed
rats. Furthermore, chitosan significantly decreased plasma TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), the TC/high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, and increased the HDL-C/(LDL-C + VLDL-C) ratio, but elevated the
plasma TG and free fatty acids concentrations in HF diet-fed rats. Plasma angiopoietin-like 4
(ANGPTL4) protein expression was not affected by the HF diet, but it was significantly increased
in chitosan-supplemented, HF-diet-fed rats. The high-fructose diet induced an increase in plasma
glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, but chitosan supplementation decreased plasma glucose and
improved impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance. Taken together, these results indicate
that supplementation with chitosan can improve the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in
a HF-diet-fed rat model.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a worldwide health care issue and is known to increase the risk of chronic diseases,
such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders [1,2]. The food industry uses high
quantities of fructose as a sweetener in candy, chocolate, and beverages, which leads to fructose
consumption increasing rapidly from 37 g/day in 1970 [3] to 49 g/day in 2004 [4]. However, many

2.2. Effects of Chitosan on Plasma Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in HF-Diet-Fed Rats
The level of fasting plasma glucose in high-fructose-diet-fed rats was significantly increased, but
supplementation of chitosan did not change the plasma glucose (Table 2). The plasma insulin levels in
HF-diet-fed rats supplemented with chitosan were significantly lower than the HF-diet-fed without
chitosan. A high-fructose diet significantly increased plasma glucose at 60, 120, and 180 min after
OGTT performance, and at 30, 60, and 120 min after ITT performance, indicating that a high-fructose
diet induces an insulin-resistant state. However, chitosan reversed the increased plasma glucose
at 180 min for OGTT and at 60 and 120 min for ITT (Figure 2). Moreover, GLUT4 translocation
evaluated by the difference in cytosol and membrane GLUT4 protein levels in the soleus muscle was
not affected by fructose diet feeding (Figure 3). Dietary supplementation with chitosan significantly
increased GLUT4 translocation in HF-diet-fed rat soleus muscles. These results could reflect the
amelioration of insulin resistance by supplementation of chitosan in HF-diet-fed rats. On the other
hand, HF-diet-fed rats supplemented with chitosan had lower plasma levels of TC, LDL-C + VLDL-C,
and TC/HDL-C ratio, but the plasma TG and free fatty acid levels in HF-diet-fed rats were enhanced
by the supplementation of chitosan in the diet (Table 2). The liver fatty acid synthase and acetyl CoA
carboxylase activities were increased in HF-diet-fed rats, but chitosan supplementation reverses the
increase in these activities (Figure 4). The decreased leptin, IL-6, and TNF-α, and increased adiponectin
were observed after chitosan treatment when compared to the HF-alone group (Table 3). In this study,
high fructose increased the total cholesterol and triglyceride contents of the liver. However, rats fed
a chitosan diet displayed decreased cholesterol and triglyceride contents in the liver (Table 4). These
results indicated that chitosan feeding can reduce hepatic accumulation in rats fed a diet enriched in
fructose. On the other hand, chitosan supplementation increased fecal cholesterol and triglyceride in
rats fed a high-fructose diet (Table 5), indicating that the reduced hepatic lipid accumulation may be
related to the increased fecal lipids.

3. Discussion
High-fructose diet (HFD) intake induced hypertrophic visceral adipose tissue [19]. In addition,
Catena  et al.  [6]  found  that HFD  leads  to  insulin  resistance  in  rats by decreasing  insulin  receptor
mRNA expression  in the skeletal muscle and  liver. In the present study, we found that  7307
long-term
HF-diet  feeding  produces  impairment  of  glucose  and  lipid  metabolism  in  rats,  including  the
induction  of  hyperglycemia,  insulin  resistance,  and  hyperlipidemia.  Therefore,  this HF-diet-fed
animal model shows symptoms similar  to  type 2 diabetes. The present work  further showed  that
supplementation  of  chitosan  in  the  diet  can  mitigate  the  increased  body  weight,
hypercholesterolemia, and  increased  insulin  resistance  induced by HF-diet  feeding  in  rats. These
results indicate that chitosan possesses the ability to improve the impairment of glucose and lipid
metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.
We  have  reported  that  chitosan  can  activate  AMPK  phosphorylation  in  a  high-fat-fed  rat
model [20] and  in a high-sucrose-fed rat model [21]. In addition, Liu et al. [11] have demonstrated
that  chitosan  can  activate  AMPK  phosphorylation  and  reverse  the  increase  in  liver  PECK  and
phospho-38 protein expressions, and reverse the decrease in skeletal AKT protein phosphorylation
and  GLUT4  translocation  in  diabetic  rats,  indicating  that  chitosan  ameliorates  hyperglycemia
through a decrease in liver gluconeogenesis and an increase in skeletal muscle glucose use. In the
present study, chitosan supplementation decreased plasma glucose, increased GLUT4 translocation,
and  improved  oral  glucose  tolerance  test  and  insulin  tolerance  test  results,  suggesting  that  the
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance induced by a long-term high-fructose diet can be alleviated by
chitosan; this effect is possibly through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation in an HFD-fed rat
model.
Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes multiple adipocytokines affecting
energy metabolism and  insulin  sensitivity  [22,23]. Hypertrophic adipocytes may  increase plasma
leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations but decrease the plasma adiponectin level. Results from this
study show that chitosan feeding significantly reduced adipose tissue weight (paraepididymal and
retroperitoneal).  Plasma  TNF-α  and  IL-6  concentrations  were  increased  and  adiponectin  was
decreased  in an HF-fed-diet  rat model. Consistent with previous  results  [12], our  results  showed
that chitosan  feeding could  reverse  the  increased TNF-α and  IL-6 and  the decreased adiponectin
levels  in  an  HF-fed-diet  rat  model.  These  results  indicate  that  chitosan  may  regulate  plasma
adipocytokines by lowering adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model.

3. Discussion
High-fructose diet (HFD) intake induced hypertrophic visceral adipose tissue [19]. In addition,
Catena et al. [6] found that HFD leads to insulin resistance in rats by decreasing insulin receptor mRNA
expression in the skeletal muscle and liver. In the present study, we found that long-term HF-diet
feeding produces impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in rats, including the induction of
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this HF-diet-fed animal model
shows symptoms similar to type 2 diabetes. The present work further showed that supplementation
of chitosan in the diet can mitigate the increased body weight, hypercholesterolemia, and increased
insulin resistance induced by HF-diet feeding in rats. These results indicate that chitosan possesses the
ability to improve the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.
We have reported that chitosan can activate AMPK phosphorylation in a high-fat-fed rat
model [20] and in a high-sucrose-fed rat model [21]. In addition, Liu et al. [11] have demonstrated that
chitosan can activate AMPK phosphorylation and reverse the increase in liver PECK and phospho-38
protein expressions, and reverse the decrease in skeletal AKT protein phosphorylation and GLUT4
translocation in diabetic rats, indicating that chitosan ameliorates hyperglycemia through a decrease
in liver gluconeogenesis and an increase in skeletal muscle glucose use. In the present study, chitosan
supplementation decreased plasma glucose, increased GLUT4 translocation, and improved oral
glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test results, suggesting that the hyperglycemia and insulin
resistance induced by a long-term high-fructose diet can be alleviated by chitosan; this effect is possibly
through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation in an HFD-fed rat model.
Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes multiple adipocytokines affecting
energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity [22,23]. Hypertrophic adipocytes may increase plasma
leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations but decrease the plasma adiponectin level. Results from
this study show that chitosan feeding significantly reduced adipose tissue weight (paraepididymal
and retroperitoneal). Plasma TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were increased and adiponectin was
decreased in an HF-fed-diet rat model. Consistent with previous results [12], our results showed that
chitosan feeding could reverse the increased TNF-α and IL-6 and the decreased adiponectin levels in
an HF-fed-diet rat model. These results indicate that chitosan may regulate plasma adipocytokines by
lowering adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model.
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an enzyme that promotes fatty tissue decomposition and
conducts lipolysis from triacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids [24]. A high-fructose
diet may dysregulate the lipolysis and lipid metabolism, decreasing the lipolysis rate in visceral
adipocytes, which may promote adipocyte enlargement by facilitating TG accumulation in
adipocytes [25]. Costabile et al. [26] showed that HSL activity is lower in type 2 diabetes, which
may be a mechanism by which obesity is accelerated in diabetes. In the present study, HF-diet feeding
decreases the lipolysis rate in retroperitoneal fats. Similar to the actions observed in the previous
study [12], our results also showed that the rate of lipolysis in retroperitoneal adipose tissue was higher
in the chitosan supplementation group. Therefore, chitosan feeding could increase the rate of lipolysis
in adipose tissue, thereby reducing the adipose tissue weight in HFD rats.
Diabetic patients have abnormal lipid metabolism [27]. Supplementation of chitosan in the diet
has been found to lower plasma TC, VLDL-C, and LDL-C levels in high-cholesterol-diet-fed hamsters
by increasing the fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acid [10]. A study has also shown that chitosan
significantly reverses the increased plasma TC and LDL-C levels in cholesterol-enriched-diet-fed
rats by upregulating the liver LDL receptor expression [28]. Yao et al. [14] have also found that
supplementation of chitosan in the diet for seven weeks reduces the plasma glucose, TC, and free
fatty acid levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In these studies, plasma TG levels were not
affected by chitosan. Similarly, the present study showed that supplementation of chitosan significantly
decreased the increased plasma levels of TC, LDL-C + VLDLC, and TC/HDL-C ratio in HF-diet-fed
rats, but the plasma TG levels were increased.

ANGPTL4, a lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase inhibitor, can decrease the dietary fatty
acid uptake in the liver, and further impairs plasma TG clearance [29,30]. PPARα can upregulate
hepatic ANGPTL4 expressions and plasma ANGPTL4 concentrations that act as a LPL activity
inhibitor [31]. ANGPTL4-related LPL activity inhibition caused the inhibition of LPL-dependent
VLDL lipolysis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia [32]. Our previous study demonstrated that chitosan
feeding can increase the hepatic PPARα expression [12]. In the present study, we found that long-term
supplementation of chitosan in the diet significantly enhanced the plasma free fatty acid and TG
levels in HF-diet-fed rats. Supplementation of chitosan in the diet could also significantly increase the
plasma ANGPTL4 protein expression in HF-diet-fed rats, but HF-diet feeding alone did not affect the
ANGPTL4 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that chitosan supplementation
increases ANGPTL4 expression, which may be upregulated by PPARα, and then enhances the lipolysis
rate in retroperitoneal fat tissues, resulting in the increase of plasma free fatty acid levels. The increased
ANGPTL4 expression could also change the plasma LPL activity, which induces a decrease in
hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins, causing the increase of plasma TG levels.
Many studies have provided evidence to produce natural therapeutic agents using chitosan and its
oligosaccharides as lead compounds for prevention and treatment of diabetes or age-related diseases
such as cancer and inflammatory diseases [33-35]. Low MW chitosan has been demonstrated to
exhibit an antidiabetic effect on genetically obese diabetic KK-Ay mice [13] and streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats [11]. High MW chitosan supplementation has been found to improve the impairment
of lipid metabolism in high-sucrose-diet-fed rats [21] and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [14].
Anraku et al. [36] have suggested that low MW chitosan possesses high antioxidant activity and
antilipidemic effect, while high MW chitosan significantly reduces the levels of pro-oxidants such
as LDL in the gastrointestinal tract in a metabolic syndrome rat model. Many studies have shown
that chitosan can prevent the accumulation of liver lipids and enhance fecal lipid excretion [10,20].
In the present study, a high-fructose diet induced an increase in liver lipids accumulation and high
MW chitosan supplementation; however, it reversed the increase in hepatic lipids and increased fecal
lipid excretion. In addition, chitosan reversed the increased liver acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty
acid synthase activities induced by HF-diet. We have reported that chitosan can suppress downstream
expression of lipogenic transcription factors through AMPK activation and lipogenesis-associated
genes inhibition, which can attenuate TG and cholesterol accumulation in liver [20]. Therefore, chitosan
improves the accumulation of liver lipids induced by the HF-diet; this may be related to the activated
AMPK phosphorylation and lipogenesis-associated genes inhibition in an HFD rat model. Further
investigation is needed to understand the detailed actions and mechanisms of chitosan on lipid
responses and lipid metabolism under an impaired glucose tolerance condition.
4. Experimental Section
4.1. High-MW Chitosan
High-MW chitosan, which was obtained from crab shell chitin by alkali fusion, was obtained from
Taiwan Tanabe Seiyaku Co. (Taipei, Taiwan). The average MW and degree of deacetylation (DD) of
chitosan were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, respectively. The DD of chitosan was about 89.8% and the average MW and viscosity
of chitosan were 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and 33 mPa.s., respectively. Fructose powder was purchased from
Archer Daniels Midland Co. (Chicago, IL, USA) and cellulose was purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The degree of deacetylation of chitosan was about 90%, and the average
MW was about 380 kDa.
4.2. Animals and Diets
Male seven-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.
(Taipei, Taiwan). Rats were fed a chow diet (Rodent Laboratory Chow, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO,
7309
Mar. Drugs 2015, 13, 7302-7313
USA) for 1one week, and then the animals were randomly divided into three groups: a control group
that received a control diet, an HF group that received a high-fructose (63.1%) diet, and a CS group
that received the HF diet with 5% chitosan. Each group contained eight rats. The compositions of
the experimental diets given to test animals are shown in Table 6. Rats were housed in individual
stainless-steel cages in a room kept at 23 ˘ 1 ˝C and 60% ˘ 5% relative humidity with a 12 h light and
dark cycle (lighting from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.). Food and drinking water were available ad libitum
and measured daily. The body weight was measured every week. The OGTT (oral glucose tolerance
test) and ITT (insulin tolerance test) experiments were performed after 16 and 18 weeks of the feeding
study, respectively. For the OGTT experiment, rats in each group orally received the glucose solution
(2 g/kg of body weight (BW)) in the fasted state. For the ITT experiment, rats in each group were
injected with insulin by i.p. (0.75 IU/kg) in the fasted state. Blood samples were obtained at 0 (before
diet loading), 30, 60, and 120 min, from the tail vein, using a heparinized capillary tube. Plasma was
isolated immediately by centrifugation at 1570ˆ g for 20 min at 4 ˝C and stored at ´80 ˝C until assay.
After the 21 weeks of the feeding study, the animals were sacrificed. This study was approved by the
Animal House Management Committee of the National Taiwan Ocean University. The animals were
maintained in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as issued by
the Animal Center of the National Science Council.
* Normal: normal control, HF: high fructose, HF + C: high fructose + chitosan. 1 AIN-93 vitamin mixture;
2 AIN-93 mineral mixture; 3 The average MW and viscosity of chitosan were about 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and
33 mPa.s., respectively. DD was about 89.8%.
4.3. Collection of Blood and Tissue Samples
At the end of the experimental period, animals fasted for 12 h prior to being sacrificed (at
10:00 a.m.) by exsanguinations via the abdominal aorta while under diethyl ether anesthesia. Heparin
was used as the anticoagulant. Plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation (1750ˆ g) at
4 ˝C for 20 min. The liver and soleus muscle from each animal were excised and weighed.
4.4. Determination of Plasma Glucose, Insulin, Adiponectin, Leptin, Free Fatty Acids, and Tumor Necrosis
Factor-α (TNF-α)
Plasma glucose was determined with a kit purchased from Audit Diagnostics Co. (Cork, Ireland).
Plasma insulin was determined using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
(Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Plasma adiponectin, leptin, and TNF-α levels were determined using
the rat ELISA kits (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Plasma free fatty acid was determined
using a kit purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan).

4.5. Determination of Plasma Lipid Concentration
purchased from Audit Diagnostics (Cork, Ireland). The TG-rich lipoproteins from a separate aliquot of
plasma were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (Hitachi, SP 85G, RPL 42T Rotor, Tokyo,
Japan) by 194,000ˆ g at 10 ˝C for 3 h, and the lipoproteins were recovered by tube slicing [37].
4.6. Determination of Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Enzymes
previously by Goodridge [38] and Nepokroeff et al. [39] respectively. The enzyme activities were
determined by the rate (nmole/min/mg protein) of NADPH increase.
4.7. Lipolysis Rate Measurement
(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) buffer containing 1 µM isoproterenol
and incubated at 37 ˝C. Isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent increase in lipolysis. There was
a‘time-dependent increase in lipolysis. After 1, 2, and 3 h of incubation, 0.2 mL of medium was used to
measure the levels of glycerol by a commercial reagent (RANDOX GY105, Amtrim, UK), and then the
absorbance at 405 nm was recorded using a spectrophotometer. The lipolysis rate was indicated by
micromoles of glycerol released per gram of tissue per hour [40].
4.8. Western Blot Analysis
(SDS)-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare,
Marlborough, USA). After blocking, blots were incubated with antibodies for α-tubulin,
angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) (Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Tween-20 for 1 h, followed by two washes in PBS/Tween-20, and
then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Moreover,
α-tubulin served as a control for sample loading and integrity. The antibody-reactive bands were
revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, USA) and were used
to expose to Kodak radiographic film. The amount of polypeptide was quantitated by integrated
densitometric analysis of the film (Kodak Gel Logic-100 Imaging System, Rochester, USA).
4.9. Statistical Evaluation
Results are given as the mean ˘ standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences among groups
were calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and group means
were considered to be significantly different at p < 0.05 as determined by Duncan’s multiple range test.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that supplementation of chitosan in the diet can effectively mitigate
the increased body weight, hypercholesterolemia, and increased insulin resistance induced by HF-diet
feeding in rats. These findings suggest that chitosan possesses the ability to improve the impairment
of glucose and lipid metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term feeding of chitosan on
plasma glucose and lipids in rats fed a high-fructose (HF) diet (63.1%). Male Sprague-Dawley
rats aged seven weeks were used as experimental animals. Rats were divided into three groups:
(1) normal group (normal); (2) HF group; (3) chitosan + HF group (HF + C). The rats were fed the
experimental diets and drinking water ad libitum for 21 weeks. The results showed that chitosan
(average molecular weight was about 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and degree of deacetylation was about
89.8%) significantly decreased body weight, paraepididymal fat mass, and retroperitoneal fat mass
weight, but elevated the lipolysis rate in retroperitoneal fats of HF diet-fed rats. Supplementation
of chitosan causes a decrease in plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-6,
and leptin, and an increase in plasma adiponectin. The HF diet increased hepatic lipids. However,
intake of chitosan reduced the accumulation of hepatic lipids, including total cholesterol (TC) and
triglyceride (TG) contents. In addition, chitosan elevated the excretion of fecal lipids in HF diet-fed
rats. Furthermore, chitosan significantly decreased plasma TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), the TC/high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, and increased the HDL-C/(LDL-C + VLDL-C) ratio, but elevated the
plasma TG and free fatty acids concentrations in HF diet-fed rats. Plasma angiopoietin-like 4
(ANGPTL4) protein expression was not affected by the HF diet, but it was significantly increased
in chitosan-supplemented, HF-diet-fed rats. The high-fructose diet induced an increase in plasma
glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, but chitosan supplementation decreased plasma glucose and
improved impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance. Taken together, these results indicate
that supplementation with chitosan can improve the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in
a HF-diet-fed rat model.

3. Discussion
High-fructose diet (HFD) intake induced hypertrophic visceral adipose tissue [19]. In addition,
Catena  et al.  [6]  found  that HFD  leads  to  insulin  resistance  in  rats by decreasing  insulin  receptor
mRNA expression  in the skeletal muscle and  liver. In the present study, we found that  7307
long-term
HF-diet  feeding  produces  impairment  of  glucose  and  lipid  metabolism  in  rats,  including  the
induction  of  hyperglycemia,  insulin  resistance,  and  hyperlipidemia.  Therefore,  this HF-diet-fed
animal model shows symptoms similar  to  type 2 diabetes. The present work  further showed  that
supplementation  of  chitosan  in  the  diet  can  mitigate  the  increased  body  weight,
hypercholesterolemia, and  increased  insulin  resistance  induced by HF-diet  feeding  in  rats. These
results indicate that chitosan possesses the ability to improve the impairment of glucose and lipid
metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.
We  have  reported  that  chitosan  can  activate  AMPK  phosphorylation  in  a  high-fat-fed  rat
model [20] and  in a high-sucrose-fed rat model [21]. In addition, Liu et al. [11] have demonstrated
that  chitosan  can  activate  AMPK  phosphorylation  and  reverse  the  increase  in  liver  PECK  and
phospho-38 protein expressions, and reverse the decrease in skeletal AKT protein phosphorylation
and  GLUT4  translocation  in  diabetic  rats,  indicating  that  chitosan  ameliorates  hyperglycemia
through a decrease in liver gluconeogenesis and an increase in skeletal muscle glucose use. In the
present study, chitosan supplementation decreased plasma glucose, increased GLUT4 translocation,
and  improved  oral  glucose  tolerance  test  and  insulin  tolerance  test  results,  suggesting  that  the
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance induced by a long-term high-fructose diet can be alleviated by
chitosan; this effect is possibly through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation in an HFD-fed rat
model.
Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes multiple adipocytokines affecting
energy metabolism and  insulin  sensitivity  [22,23]. Hypertrophic adipocytes may  increase plasma
leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations but decrease the plasma adiponectin level. Results from this
study show that chitosan feeding significantly reduced adipose tissue weight (paraepididymal and
retroperitoneal).  Plasma  TNF-α  and  IL-6  concentrations  were  increased  and  adiponectin  was
decreased  in an HF-fed-diet  rat model. Consistent with previous  results  [12], our  results  showed
that chitosan  feeding could  reverse  the  increased TNF-α and  IL-6 and  the decreased adiponectin
levels  in  an  HF-fed-diet  rat  model.  These  results  indicate  that  chitosan  may  regulate  plasma
adipocytokines by lowering adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model.

3. Discussion
High-fructose diet (HFD) intake induced hypertrophic visceral adipose tissue [19]. In addition,
Catena et al. [6] found that HFD leads to insulin resistance in rats by decreasing insulin receptor mRNA
expression in the skeletal muscle and liver. In the present study, we found that long-term HF-diet

insulin resistance induced by HF-diet feeding in rats. These results indicate that chitosan possesses the
ability to improve the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in a HF-diet-fed rat model.
We have reported that chitosan can activate AMPK phosphorylation in a high-fat-fed rat
model [20] and in a high-sucrose-fed rat model [21]. In addition, Liu et al. [11] have demonstrated that
chitosan can activate AMPK phosphorylation and reverse the increase in liver PECK and phospho-38
protein expressions, and reverse the decrease in skeletal AKT protein phosphorylation and GLUT4
translocation in diabetic rats, indicating that chitosan ameliorates hyperglycemia through a decrease
in liver gluconeogenesis and an increase in skeletal muscle glucose use. In the present study, chitosan
supplementation decreased plasma glucose, increased GLUT4 translocation, and improved oral
glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test results, suggesting that the hyperglycemia and insulin

through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation in an HFD-fed rat model.
Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes multiple adipocytokines affecting
energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity [22,23]. Hypertrophic adipocytes may increase plasma
leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations but decrease the plasma adiponectin level. Results from
this study show that chitosan feeding significantly reduced adipose tissue weight (paraepididymal
and retroperitoneal). Plasma TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were increased and adiponectin was
decreased in an HF-fed-diet rat model. Consistent with previous results [12], our results showed that
chitosan feeding could reverse the increased TNF-α and IL-6 and the decreased adiponectin levels in
an HF-fed-diet rat model. These results indicate that chitosan may regulate plasma adipocytokines by
lowering adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model.
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an enzyme that promotes fatty tissue decomposition and
conducts lipolysis from triacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids [24]. A high-fructose
diet may dysregulate the lipolysis and lipid metabolism, decreasing the lipolysis rate in visceral
adipocytes, which may promote adipocyte enlargement by facilitating TG accumulation in
adipocytes [25]. Costabile et al. [26] showed that HSL activity is lower in type 2 diabetes, which
may be a mechanism by which obesity is accelerated in diabetes. In the present study, HF-diet feeding
decreases the lipolysis rate in retroperitoneal fats. Similar to the actions observed in the previous
study [12], our results also showed that the rate of lipolysis in retroperitoneal adipose tissue was higher
in the chitosan supplementation group. Therefore, chitosan feeding could increase the rate of lipolysis
in adipose tissue, thereby reducing the adipose tissue weight in HFD rats.
Diabetic patients have abnormal lipid metabolism [27]. Supplementation of chitosan in the diet
has been found to lower plasma TC, VLDL-C, and LDL-C levels in high-cholesterol-diet-fed hamsters
by increasing the fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acid [10]. A study has also shown that chitosan
significantly reverses the increased plasma TC and LDL-C levels in cholesterol-enriched-diet-fed
rats by upregulating the liver LDL receptor expression [28]. Yao et al. [14] have also found that
supplementation of chitosan in the diet for seven weeks reduces the plasma glucose, TC, and free
fatty acid levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In these studies, plasma TG levels were not
affected by chitosan. Similarly, the present study showed that supplementation of chitosan significantly
decreased the increased plasma levels of TC, LDL-C + VLDLC, and TC/HDL-C ratio in HF-diet-fed
rats, but the plasma TG levels were increased.

ANGPTL4, a lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase inhibitor, can decrease the dietary fatty
acid uptake in the liver, and further impairs plasma TG clearance [29,30]. PPARα can upregulate
hepatic ANGPTL4 expressions and plasma ANGPTL4 concentrations that act as a LPL activity
inhibitor [31]. ANGPTL4-related LPL activity inhibition caused the inhibition of LPL-dependent
VLDL lipolysis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia [32]. Our previous study demonstrated that chitosan
feeding can increase the hepatic PPARα expression [12]. In the present study, we found that long-term
supplementation of chitosan in the diet significantly enhanced the plasma free fatty acid and TG
levels in HF-diet-fed rats. Supplementation of chitosan in the diet could also significantly increase the
plasma ANGPTL4 protein expression in HF-diet-fed rats, but HF-diet feeding alone did not affect the
ANGPTL4 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that chitosan supplementation
increases ANGPTL4 expression, which may be upregulated by PPARα, and then enhances the lipolysis
rate in retroperitoneal fat tissues, resulting in the increase of plasma free fatty acid levels. The increased
ANGPTL4 expression could also change the plasma LPL activity, which induces a decrease in
hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins, causing the increase of plasma TG levels.
Many studies have provided evidence to produce natural therapeutic agents using chitosan and its
oligosaccharides as lead compounds for prevention and treatment of diabetes or age-related diseases
such as cancer and inflammatory diseases [33-35]. Low MW chitosan has been demonstrated to
exhibit an antidiabetic effect on genetically obese diabetic KK-Ay mice [13] and streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats [11]. High MW chitosan supplementation has been found to improve the impairment
of lipid metabolism in high-sucrose-diet-fed rats [21] and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [14].
Anraku et al. [36] have suggested that low MW chitosan possesses high antioxidant activity and
antilipidemic effect, while high MW chitosan significantly reduces the levels of pro-oxidants such
as LDL in the gastrointestinal tract in a metabolic syndrome rat model. Many studies have shown
that chitosan can prevent the accumulation of liver lipids and enhance fecal lipid excretion [10,20].
In the present study, a high-fructose diet induced an increase in liver lipids accumulation and high
MW chitosan supplementation; however, it reversed the increase in hepatic lipids and increased fecal
lipid excretion. In addition, chitosan reversed the increased liver acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty
acid synthase activities induced by HF-diet. We have reported that chitosan can suppress downstream
expression of lipogenic transcription factors through AMPK activation and lipogenesis-associated
genes inhibition, which can attenuate TG and cholesterol accumulation in liver [20]. Therefore, chitosan
improves the accumulation of liver lipids induced by the HF-diet; this may be related to the activated
AMPK phosphorylation and lipogenesis-associated genes inhibition in an HFD rat model. Further
investigation is needed to understand the detailed actions and mechanisms of chitosan on lipid
responses and lipid metabolism under an impaired glucose tolerance condition.
4. Experimental Section
4.1. High-MW Chitosan
High-MW chitosan, which was obtained from crab shell chitin by alkali fusion, was obtained from
Taiwan Tanabe Seiyaku Co. (Taipei, Taiwan). The average MW and degree of deacetylation (DD) of
chitosan were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, respectively. The DD of chitosan was about 89.8% and the average MW and viscosity
of chitosan were 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and 33 mPa.s., respectively. Fructose powder was purchased from
Archer Daniels Midland Co. (Chicago, IL, USA) and cellulose was purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The degree of deacetylation of chitosan was about 90%, and the average
MW was about 380 kDa.
4.2. Animals and Diets
Male seven-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.
(Taipei, Taiwan). Rats were fed a chow diet (Rodent Laboratory Chow, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO,
7309
Mar. Drugs 2015, 13, 7302-7313
USA) for 1one week, and then the animals were randomly divided into three groups: a control group
that received a control diet, an HF group that received a high-fructose (63.1%) diet, and a CS group
that received the HF diet with 5% chitosan. Each group contained eight rats. The compositions of
the experimental diets given to test animals are shown in Table 6. Rats were housed in individual
stainless-steel cages in a room kept at 23 ˘ 1 ˝C and 60% ˘ 5% relative humidity with a 12 h light and
dark cycle (lighting from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.). Food and drinking water were available ad libitum
and measured daily. The body weight was measured every week. The OGTT (oral glucose tolerance
test) and ITT (insulin tolerance test) experiments were performed after 16 and 18 weeks of the feeding
study, respectively. For the OGTT experiment, rats in each group orally received the glucose solution
(2 g/kg of body weight (BW)) in the fasted state. For the ITT experiment, rats in each group were
injected with insulin by i.p. (0.75 IU/kg) in the fasted state. Blood samples were obtained at 0 (before
diet loading), 30, 60, and 120 min, from the tail vein, using a heparinized capillary tube. Plasma was
isolated immediately by centrifugation at 1570ˆ g for 20 min at 4 ˝C and stored at ´80 ˝C until assay.
After the 21 weeks of the feeding study, the animals were sacrificed. This study was approved by the
Animal House Management Committee of the National Taiwan Ocean University. The animals were
maintained in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as issued by
the Animal Center of the National Science Council.
* Normal: normal control, HF: high fructose, HF + C: high fructose + chitosan. 1 AIN-93 vitamin mixture;
2 AIN-93 mineral mixture; 3 The average MW and viscosity of chitosan were about 3.8 ˆ 105 Dalton and
33 mPa.s., respectively. DD was about 89.8%.
4.3. Collection of Blood and Tissue Samples
At the end of the experimental period, animals fasted for 12 h prior to being sacrificed (at
10:00 a.m.) by exsanguinations via the abdominal aorta while under diethyl ether anesthesia. Heparin
was used as the anticoagulant. Plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation (1750ˆ g) at
4 ˝C for 20 min. The liver and soleus muscle from each animal were excised and weighed.
4.4. Determination of Plasma Glucose, Insulin, Adiponectin, Leptin, Free Fatty Acids, and Tumor Necrosis
Factor-α (TNF-α)
Plasma glucose was determined with a kit purchased from Audit Diagnostics Co. (Cork, Ireland).
Plasma insulin was determined using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
(Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Plasma adiponectin, leptin, and TNF-α levels were determined using
the rat ELISA kits (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Plasma free fatty acid was determined
using a kit purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan).
7310
Mar. Drugs 2015, 13, 7302-7313
4.5. Determination of Plasma Lipid Concentration
purchased from Audit Diagnostics (Cork, Ireland). The TG-rich lipoproteins from a separate aliquot of
plasma were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (Hitachi, SP 85G, RPL 42T Rotor, Tokyo,
Japan) by 194,000ˆ g at 10 ˝C for 3 h, and the lipoproteins were recovered by tube slicing [37].
4.6. Determination of Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Enzymes
previously by Goodridge [38] and Nepokroeff et al. [39] respectively. The enzyme activities were
determined by the rate (nmole/min/mg protein) of NADPH increase.
4.7. Lipolysis Rate Measurement
(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) buffer containing 1 µM isoproterenol
and incubated at 37 ˝C. Isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent increase in lipolysis. There was
a‘time-dependent increase in lipolysis. After 1, 2, and 3 h of incubation, 0.2 mL of medium was used to
measure the levels of glycerol by a commercial reagent (RANDOX GY105, Amtrim, UK), and then the
absorbance at 405 nm was recorded using a spectrophotometer. The lipolysis rate was indicated by
micromoles of glycerol released per gram of tissue per hour [40].
4.8. Western Blot Analysis
(SDS)-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare,
Marlborough, USA). After blocking, blots were incubated with antibodies for α-tubulin,
angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) (Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Tween-20 for 1 h, followed by two washes in PBS/Tween-20, and
then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Moreover,
α-tubulin served as a control for sample loading and integrity. The antibody-reactive bands were
revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, USA) and were used
to expose to Kodak radiographic film. The amount of polypeptide was quantitated by integrated
densitometric analysis of the film (Kodak Gel Logic-100 Imaging System, Rochester, USA).
4.9. Statistical Evaluation
Results are given as the mean ˘ standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences among groups
were calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and group means
were considered to be significantly different at p < 0.05 as determined by Duncan’s multiple range test.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a worldwide health care issue and is known to increase the risk of chronic diseases,
such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders [1,2]. The food industry uses high
quantities of fructose as a sweetener in candy, chocolate, and beverages, which leads to fructose
consumption increasing rapidly from 37 g/day in 1970 [3] to 49 g/day in 2004 [4]. However, many

2.2. Effects of Chitosan on Plasma Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in HF-Diet-Fed Rats
The level of fasting plasma glucose in high-fructose-diet-fed rats was significantly increased, but
supplementation of chitosan did not change the plasma glucose (Table 2). The plasma insulin levels in
HF-diet-fed rats supplemented with chitosan were significantly lower than the HF-diet-fed without
chitosan. A high-fructose diet significantly increased plasma glucose at 60, 120, and 180 min after
OGTT performance, and at 30, 60, and 120 min after ITT performance, indicating that a high-fructose
diet induces an insulin-resistant state. However, chitosan reversed the increased plasma glucose
at 180 min for OGTT and at 60 and 120 min for ITT (Figure 2). Moreover, GLUT4 translocation
evaluated by the difference in cytosol and membrane GLUT4 protein levels in the soleus muscle was
not affected by fructose diet feeding (Figure 3). Dietary supplementation with chitosan significantly
increased GLUT4 translocation in HF-diet-fed rat soleus muscles. These results could reflect the
amelioration of insulin resistance by supplementation of chitosan in HF-diet-fed rats. On the other
hand, HF-diet-fed rats supplemented with chitosan had lower plasma levels of TC, LDL-C + VLDL-C,
and TC/HDL-C ratio, but the plasma TG and free fatty acid levels in HF-diet-fed rats were enhanced
by the supplementation of chitosan in the diet (Table 2). The liver fatty acid synthase and acetyl CoA
carboxylase activities were increased in HF-diet-fed rats, but chitosan supplementation reverses the
increase in these activities (Figure 4). The decreased leptin, IL-6, and TNF-α, and increased adiponectin
were observed after chitosan treatment when compared to the HF-alone group (Table 3). In this study,
high fructose increased the total cholesterol and triglyceride contents of the liver. However, rats fed
a chitosan diet displayed decreased cholesterol and triglyceride contents in the liver (Table 4). These
results indicated that chitosan feeding can reduce hepatic accumulation in rats fed a diet enriched in
fructose. On the other hand, chitosan supplementation increased fecal cholesterol and triglyceride in
rats fed a high-fructose diet (Table 5), indicating that the reduced hepatic lipid accumulation may be
related to the increased fecal lipids.
