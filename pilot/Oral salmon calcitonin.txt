BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Oral salmon calcitonin (sCT), a dual-action amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, improved glucose homeostasis in
diet-induced obese rats. Here, we have evaluated the anti-diabetic efficacy of oral sCT using parameters of glycaemic control
and beta-cell morphology in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Male ZDF rats were treated with oral sCT (0.5, 1.0 or 2 mg·kg-1) or oral vehicle twice daily from age 8 to 18 weeks. Zucker
lean rats served as control group. Fasting and non-fasted blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and levels of
pancreas and incretin hormones were determined. Oral glucose tolerance test and i.p. glucose tolerance test were compared,
and beta-cell area and function were evaluated.
KEY RESULTS
Oral sCT treatment dose-dependently attenuated fasting and non-fasted hyperglycaemia during the intervention period. At
the end of the study period, oral sCT treatment by dose decreased diabetic hyperglycaemia by ~9 mM and reduced HbA1c
levels by 1.7%. Furthermore, a pronounced reduction in glucose excursions was dose-dependently observed for oral sCT
treatment during oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, oral sCT treatment sustained hyperinsulinaemia and attenuated
hyperglucagonaemia and hypersecretion of total glucagon-like peptide-1 predominantly in the basal state. Lastly, oral sCT
treatment dose-dependently improved pancreatic beta-cell function and beta-cell area at study end.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Oral sCT attenuated diabetic hyperglycaemia in male ZDF rats by improving postprandial glycaemic control, exerting an
insulinotropic and glucagonostatic action in the basal state and by preserving pancreatic beta-cell function and beta-cell area.

the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (Dunning and Gerich,

2007). Thus, anti-diabetic therapy should optimally reverse
these defects and target insulin action, pancreatic function
and hyperglucagonaemia, thereby attenuating the 
development of fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia in patients
with type 2 diabetes (Wajchenberg, 2007).
Several oral anti-diabetic agents are available to improve a
hyperglycaemic state by increasing insulin secretion (e.g. 
sul-fonylureas), improving insulin sensitivity (e.g. 
thiazolidinedi-ones) and decreasing endogenous glucose production (e.g.
metformin); however, adequate glycaemic control of type 2
diabetic patients is difficult to achieve. Low and deteriorating
efficacy and/or risk of hypoglycaemia, cardiac failure, weight
gain and bone fractures are limiting factors associated with
current treatments (Granberry et al., 2007; Amiel et al., 2008;
Krentz et al., 2008). Novel promising hormone-based 
therapies resembling an endogenous mode of action, such as
glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and amylin analogues, are
now emerging. However, it is still unclear whether these
approaches possess intrinsic abilities to improve beta-cell
health (Krentz et al., 2008).
Our group recently showed that an oral form of salmon
calcitonin (sCT), a known amylin receptor agonist, 
possessed glucoregulatory abilities in diet-induced obese rats, a
response that partially mimicked the effects of amylin, but
in addition also provided direct effects on blood glucose
and insulin levels, with an indication of an improvement in
beta-cell function and insulin action (Feigh et al., 2011).
While it was observed that oral sCT resembled 
well-described amylin actions as regards energy homeostasis by
influencing food intake and energy expenditure thereby
regulating body weight (Lutz et al., 2000), the direct effect
on glucose homeostasis could not be solely explained by an
amylin-like inhibitory effect on gastric emptying (Young
et al., 1995) and glucagonostatic action (Gedulin et al.,
1997).
One possible explanation for the glucoregulatory capacity
of sCT is its dual agonist effect on both the amylin and the
calcitonin receptor (Purdue et al., 2002), in contrast to amylin
only binding to and activating the amylin receptor (Tilaka-
ratne et al., 2000). Another important distinct feature is the
novel oral delivery system that mimics the physiological
pathway of endogenous secretion, where the highest 
concentrations are found in the splanchnic and portal circulation as
seen for other hormones involved in the regulation of 
appetite and glucose homeostasis (Malkov et al., 2005; Steinert
et al., 2009).
Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that oral
sCT could attenuate the development of diabetic 
hyperglycaemia in an animal model of progressive type 2 diabetes, the
male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. The hyperglycaemic,
hyperinsulinaemic and hyperglucagonaemic phenotypes
observed in male ZDF rats resemble those commonly
observed in patients with type 2 diabetes (Bergman et al.,
2002; Dunning and Gerich, 2007; Kahn et al., 2009). 
Furthermore, the progressive and irreversibly beta-cell deterioration
and failure observed in male ZDF rats (Etgen and Oldham,
2000) makes this animal model highly suitable for the 
evaluation of therapeutic interventions as regards pancreatic 
preservation and/or degeneration in type 2 diabetes.
Oral sCT treatment in the ZDF rat model has not yet been
examined; therefore, to test our hypothesis, we characterized
152 British Journal of Pharmacology (2012) 167 151-163
the effect of multiple doses of oral sCT, compared to their
vehicle (5-CNAC), with respect to glucose homeostasis in ZDF
rats. To test the hypothesis that oral sCT could delay or
attenuate progression of type 2 diabetes in ZDF rats, 
treatment was initiated during the ‘pre-diabetes’ phase and 
continued into the beta-cell deterioration stage. Further, to
elucidate the mode of action of oral sCT, we explored 
postprandial glycaemia during glucose tolerance testing and
investigated the involvement of pancreas and incretin 
glucoregulatory hormones in mediating glycaemic control.
Finally, we examined pancreatic beta-cell morphology as
regards chronic treatment.
Methods
sCT therapy
For oral delivery of sCT, the carrier agent 5-CNAC (N-(5-
chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid) was obtained from
Biomics Biotechnologies Co., Ltd. (Nantong, China) and 
prepared by mixing recombinant sCT at 0.5, 1 or 2 mg·kg-1
(Chinese Peptide Company, Zhejiang, China) with
150 mg·kg-1 of 5-CNAC. Vehicle-treated rats were given
5-CNAC only. All animals were dosed by oral gavage in a
volume of 5 mL·kg-1 body weight twice daily.
Experimental animals
All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with
the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010;McGrath et al.,
2010). The experiment was approved by the Experimental
Animal Committee of the Danish Ministry of Justice and was
performed according to the European Standard for Good
Clinical Practice (2008/561-1450). Male ZDF (fa/fa) rats and
male Zucker (+/+; ZL) lean rats were obtained at the age of
7 weeks from Charles River Laboratories (Kisslegg, 
Deutsch-land). All animals were housed at the animal facility at Nordic
Bioscience with a constant temperature (21-23°C) and 
relative humidity (55-65%) on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free
access to Purina 5008 rat chow (Brogaarden, Lynge,
Denmark) and tap water.
At the age of 8 weeks, the animals were randomized into
five groups based upon fasting blood glucose and body
weight (Table 1). The doses of oral sCT were based on 
previous experiments (Feigh et al., 2011). Animals were treated for
a total of 10 weeks, until 18 weeks of age. Body weight and
food consumption were measured weekly.
Fasting and non-fasted glucose
Blood was collected from the tail vein at baseline and before
morning drug administration once weekly during the study
period. Whole blood glucose levels were determined with an
ACCU-CHEK® Avia blood glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics,
Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
Fasting insulin, glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP
At baseline and after 4 and 9 weeks of treatment, plasma
insulin and glucagon levels were analysed using the 
Merco-dia® Rat Insulin ELISA kit (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden)
and Rat Glucagon (1-29) EIA kit (Bachem, Weil am Rhein,
salmon calcitonin in ZDF rats BJPOral
Germany), respectively. After 3 and 8 weeks of treatment,
plasma total GLP-1 and total GIP levels were analysed using
GLP-1 Total ELISA and GIP Total ELISA kit (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) respectively.
Glucose tolerance testing and
beta-cell function
After 4 weeks of treatment, the four treatment groups were
subjected to an OGTT, and after 5 weeks, an IPGTT was 
performed. After an overnight fast of approximately 16 h and
15 min after the drug administration, rats received glucose by
p.o. gavage (1 g·kg-1) (OGTT) or by i.p. injection (1 g·kg-1)
(IPGTT), respectively. Blood samples were collected from the
tail vein before drug administration (-15 min) and glucose
challenge (0 min) and 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post
challenge.
A beta-cell function index was calculated as the ratio of
fasting insulin/fasting glucose (Topp et al., 2007). This ratio
was calculated from the fasting plasma insulin and blood
glucose values measured at baseline and after 9 weeks of
treatment.
Tissue collection
During the tenth week of treatment, rats were given their
morning dose and fasted for 5 h, and subsequently, whole
blood glucose were determined as described above. HbA1c
levels were determined using the DCA Vantage™ Analyzer
(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). The rats were
then killed by cervical dislocation, and the pancreas was
removed en bloc and placed in 4% formaldehyde for 
immu-nohistochemical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
After an overnight fixation, tissue samples were washed and
subsequently dissected of surrounding tissue, dehydrated and
embedded in paraffin. The paraffin sections (5 mm in 
thick-ness) were dried on slides overnight at 37°C and were 
depar-affinized and rehydrated at room temperature. For antigen

retrieval, the sections were placed in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6) and heated for 2 ¥ 5 min at 800 W in a microwave
oven to stain for insulin, and the endogenous peroxidase was
then blocked by 1% H2O2 in 99% ethanol followed by 
blocking in 10% rabbit normal serum. Pancreatic beta-cells were
stained using polyclonal guinea-pig anti-insulin (Dako
A0564, Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by
HRP-coupled polyclonal rabbit anti-guinea pig (Dako P0141,
Dako Denmark A/S) and developed in 3-amino-9-ethyl-
carbazole (AEC) (A5754) (Sigma-Aldrich Denmark A/S,
Broendby, Denmark). Finally, slides were counterstained with
Mayer’s haematoxylin and mounted with Kayser Mounting
Media.
Morphometric analysis
For the determination of the fractional beta-cell area, the
entire pancreatic section was imaged at ¥4 magnification
using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Instruments
Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a PixeLINK camera (Pix-
eLINK, Ottawa, Canada). Insulin-stained sections, derived
from three to five levels of the embedded pancreatic tissue,
were chosen for evaluation; and a composite image of each
individual field was generated in the new CAST system (Visi-
opharm, Hoersholm, Denmark) to control the stage and data
collection. The pancreas section stained positive for insulin
was quantified as fractional beta-cell area per total pancreatic
section, and subsequently, the mean for each individual
animal was calculated. All analyses were performed in a
blinded fashion.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean  SEM. The statistical analysis
of drug effects versus vehicle effects was done by one-way
ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s post hoc test. Student’s t-test
was used to compare lean control group and vehicle. All
analyses were carried out using GRAPHPAD PRISM software
(GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). A value of P < 0.05 was
considered to be significant.

Results
Effects of oral sCT treatment on body
weight and food consumption during the
study period
At the start of the study, body weight was similar in the four
randomized obese ZDF groups, although body weight was
significantly increased compared with ZL-Control rats
(Table 1).
As expected, cumulative food intake and body weight
were significantly increased in ZDF groups compared with
ZL-Control littermates throughout the study period (Table 2),
confirming the hyperphagic and obese state of male ZDF rats
(Tokuyama et al., 1995). Interestingly, body weight gain
tended to be more pronounced in the oral sCT treated rats by
dose, with the ZDF-sCT 2 mg·kg-1 group being significantly
heavier (P < 0.05) than the ZDF-Vehicle rats at study end. In
contrast, a trend towards reduction in cumulative food intake
was observed in oral sCT treated rats, especially during the
last part of the study period, when compared with the 
ZDF-Vehicle group (Table 2).
Effects of oral sCT treatment on glycaemic
control during the study period
Pre-intervention blood glucose levels were similar among the
four pre-diabetic ZDF groups but were significantly elevated
compared with their ZL-Control counterparts both in a
fasting (P < 0.05) and non-fasted (P < 0.001) state (Table 1). As
expected, glycaemic control was progressively deteriorated in
the ZDF-Vehicle rats during the study period, and a 
pronounced diabetic hyperglycaemic state was observed from
week five of intervention (at 13 weeks of age) (Figure 1A,B).
In contrast, fasting and non-fasted blood glucose levels were
almost unchanged in oral ZDF-sCT treated rats at 1 and
2 mg·kg-1 doses during the first 5 weeks of treatment and
remained significantly attenuated compared with the 
ZDF-Vehicle group for the duration of the study (Figure 1A,B). At
termination following a 5 h fast, the ZDF-Vehicle rats 
demonstrated severe hyperglycaemia (plasma glucose level
>27 mmol·L-1); oral sCT dose-dependently and significantly
attenuated hyperglycaemia, resulting in approximately
9 mmol·L-1 reductions in plasma glucose levels in rats treated
with the 1 and 2 mg·kg-1 doses (P < 0.01) (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, compared with ZDF-Vehicle rats, oral sCT
treatment dose-dependently and significantly reduced
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels after 5 weeks with
a maximum effect of ~1.7% observed in ZDF rats given
2 mg·kg-1 compared with ZDF-vehicle (P < 0.001) (data not
shown). This reduction in HbA1C levels was sustained
throughout the intervention period, with a maximum 
reducing effect of ~1.7% at study end for ZDF rats given oral sCT at
1 and 2 mg·kg-1 (P < 0.01) (Figure 1D).
Effects of oral sCT treatment on pancreatic
glucoregulatory hormones during the
study period
At study start, fasting levels of plasma insulin and glucagon
were similar between ZDF intervention groups. The 
pre-diabetic hyperinsulinaemic state in the ZDF rats was clearly
demonstrated by significantly elevated fasting plasma insulin
compared with ZL-Control rats (P < 0.001) (Table 1). In 
contrast, compared with the ZL-Control group, fasting plasma
glucagon was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in ZDF rats,
possibly as a result of hyperinsulinaemic intra-islet paracrine
suppression (Kawamori and Kulkarni, 2009). During the
intervention period, a marked reduction in fasting plasma
insulin from baseline (approximately 65%) was observed in
ZDF-Vehicle rats, confirming a deterioration of the pancreatic
beta-cell secretory function as these animals developed severe
diabetes (Paulsen et al., 2010). In contrast, hyperinsulinaemia
was dose-dependently sustained in the ZDF-sCT-treated
groups with plasma insulin levels being significantly
increased for sCT 1 mg·kg-1 (P < 0.01) and sCT 2 mg·kg-1 (P <
0.001) treated rats when compared with ZDF-Vehicle group at
study end (Figure 2A). In contrast, the fasting plasma 
glucagon concentration was markedly increased (~2.5-fold) in the
ZDF-Vehicle group during the study period, indicating a
defect in pancreatic alpha-cell function resulting in 
hyperglucagonaemia (Dunning and Gerich, 2007). The oral sCT 
treatment dose-dependently attenuated this hyperglucagonaemia
throughout the study period, with plasma levels of glucagon
being significantly reduced for sCT (1 and 2 mg·kg-1) treated
groups compared with ZDF-Vehicle rats (P < 0.05) at study
end (Figure 2B).

end (Figure 3A). In contrast, compared with ZDF-Vehicle, oral
sCT treatment did not influence plasma levels of total GIP
(Figure 3B).
Effects of oral sCT treatment on incretin
glucoregulatory hormones during the
study period
After 3 and 8 weeks of intervention, ZDF-Vehicle rats 
exhibited a pronounced hypersecretion of incretin hormones with
plasma total GLP-1 and GIP levels being significantly
increased (P < 0.001) compared with their lean control 
litter-mates (Figure 3). Interestingly, plasma total GLP-1 
concentration was dose-dependently decreased by oral sCT treatment
during the intervention period with a significant reduction
Effects of oral sCT treatment on acute
glycaemic control during glucose
tolerance tests
As expected, ZDF-Vehicle rats showed overt glucose 
intolerance during both OGTT (Figure 4A) and IPGTT (Figure 4B).
Thirty minutes after glucose administration, glycaemia was
~26 mM in ZDF-Vehicle rats, which, in contrast, was 
dose-dependently and significantly reduced by 83% (P < 0.001)
and 26% (P < 0.01) in oral sCT 2 mg·kg-1 treated rats during
OGTT and IPGTT, respectively. Furthermore, throughout the

observation period glycaemia during oral and i.p. glucose
tolerance testing was dose-dependently and significantly
reduced by oral sCT (Figure 4A,B). Calculation of total
AUCs (0-240 min) demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction by
50% (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C) and 30% (P < 0.01) (Figure 4D)
during OGTT and IPGTT, respectively, for the highest doses
of oral sCT given compared with the ZDF-Vehicle group.

However, when blood glucose excursion was determined over
the first 30 min after glucose loading as AUC of change from
baseline, oral sCT significantly and dose-dependently
reduced this plasma glucose excursion, by approximately
70% in oral sCT 2 mg·kg-1 treated rats compared with 
ZDF-Vehicle (P < 0.001) during the OGTT (Figure 4E), albeit no
change was observed during IPGTT (Figure 4F).

Effects of oral sCT treatment on pancreatic
and incretin glucoregulatory hormones
during OGTT
Interestingly, acute pre-glucose administration of oral sCT
dose-dependently increased the plasma insulin level 
compared with ZDF-Vehicle group (P < 0.05 for ZDF-sCT 1 and
2 mg·kg-1) (Figure 5A). However, no further 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was observed during the 4 h
observation period in oral sCT-treated rats; and, in contrast,
an acute decline in plasma insulin was observed during the
initial 30 min post-glucose dosing when compared with 
ZDF-Vehicle. In contrast, acute pre-glucose dosing with oral sCT
dose-dependently decreased plasma glucagon levels 
compared with ZDF-Vehicle (P < 0.001 for ZDF-sCT 1 and
2 mg·kg-1) (Figure 5B). However, although absolute plasma
insulin and glucagon concentrations were increased and 
suppressed, respectively, by oral sCT during the OGTT when
158 British Journal of Pharmacology (2012) 167 151-163
compared with ZDF-Vehicle (Figure 5A,B), no significant 
difference in AUC of change was observed between the 
intervention groups (data not shown). To further explore the basal
insulin secretion and glucagon suppression in response to
acute oral sCT administration, pre-glucose dosing levels of
incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP were analysed on the
OGTT day. Interestingly, plasma total GLP-1 was significantly
decreased in ZDF-sCT 2 mg·kg-1 treated rats compared with
ZDF-Vehicle (P < 0.01) (Figure 5C), but no pre-glucose dosing
effect of oral sCT was observed on plasma total GIP
(Figure 5D).
Effects of oral sCT treatment on pancreatic
beta-cell area and function at study end
At 18 weeks of age, pancreatic islet structure in ZDF-Vehicle
rats was highly irregular in shape and size compared with
ZL-Control (Figure 6A,B), thus confirming the diabetic 
phenotype of the ZDF rat with deterioration of normal islet
morphology (Paulsen et al., 2010). In contrast, rats treated
with oral sCT 2 mg·kg-1 resulted in a more regular islet shape,
although islet size was markedly increased compared with
ZL-Control (Figure 6C). Immunohistochemistry for insulin
demonstrated severe degranulation of beta cells in 
ZDF-Vehicle rats compared with ZL-Control rats (Figure 6A,B).
Insulin-positive staining area, which reflects beta-cell area,
was also significantly reduced by approximately 65% (P <
0.001) in the ZDF-Vehicle group versus ZL-Control group
(Figure 6D). In contrast, oral sCT treatment dose-dependently
demonstrated extensive insulin staining of beta cells
(Figure 6C), with beta-cell area in the sCT 2 mg·kg-1 treated
rats being comparable with that observed in ZL-Control rats
(NS by one-way ANOVA between intervention-groups, P < 0.05
by unpaired t-test for ZDF-sCT 2 mg·kg-1 compared with 
ZDF-Vehicle) (Figure 6D). A beta-cell function index was 
calculated as the ratio of fasting insulin/fasting glucose. Compared
with baseline values, this index was markedly reduced (~13-
fold) at study end in ZDF-Vehicle rats (P < 0.05 vs.
ZL-Control). In contrast, although beta-cell function index
was reduced from baseline in oral sCT-treated rats, sCT 
dose-dependently and significantly increased this index (P < 0.05
for ZDF-sCT 1 mg·kg-1 and P < 0.01 for ZDF-sCT 2 mg·kg-1) at
study end when compared with ZDF-Vehicle (Figure 6E).

Discussion
In the present study, male ZDF rats, an animal model of type
2 diabetes, were used to evaluate the effects of oral sCT 
treatment on glycaemic control, pancreatic and incretin 
hormonal profiles and pancreatic beta-cell morphology; we
extended previous studies on the beneficial influence of oral
sCT on glucose homeostasis in lean healthy and diet-induced
obese rats (Feigh et al., 2011; 2012). We demonstrated that
oral sCT dose-dependently attenuates the development of
hyperglycaemia in severely diabetic ZDF rats as observed by
reductions in fasting and non-fasted blood glucose and
HbA1C. In addition, oral sCT, independently of incretin 
hormones, induced an insulinotropic and glucagonostatic action
in the basal state. Furthermore, oral sCT treatment markedly
improved postprandial glycaemic control during acute
glucose tolerance testing. Lastly, oral sCT treatment preserved
pancreatic beta-cell area and function relative to vehicle
control.
Establishing an oral delivery system for gut-derived
peptide drugs involved in the regulation of appetite and
glucose homeostasis is of great importance to mimic the
physiological pathway of endogenous secretion, where the
highest concentrations are found in the splanchnic and
portal circulation (Malkov et al., 2005; Steinert et al., 2010).

BJP M Feigh et al.
The present novel findings introduce an approach for oral
delivery of peptides resembling the action of 
pancreatic-derived hormones in type 2 diabetes, with focus on the
amylin-like effects of sCT.
Several clinical studies in type 2 diabetic patients have
demonstrated that the amylin-analogue pramlintide reduces
the postprandial glucose excursion by delaying an 
exaggerated gastric emptying rate and reducing 
hyperglucagonaemia. However, pramlintide improves glucose homeostasis
and HbA1C only when used as an adjunct to insulin therapy
(Fineman et al., 2002; Hollander et al., 2003a; 2003b; Maggs
et al., 2004).
In the present study, oral sCT treatment exerted 
amylin-like effects by inducing a pronounced reduction in 
postprandial glycaemia during OGTT in ZDF rats, as also recently
demonstrated in lean healthy and diet-induced obese rats
(Feigh et al., 2011; 2012). Although the effects of oral sCT
upon gastric emptying were not measured directly, the 
pronounced reduction in glucose excursion during the initial
phase following glucose administration during OGTT, but
not IPGTT, do suggest a mode of action involving glucose
absorption from the GI tract. In support of this, we and others
observed a delaying effect of sCT on gastric emptying in lean
healthy rats (Reidelberger et al., 2002; Feigh et al., 2011). 
Furthermore, in line with previous observations in diet-induced
obese rats (Feigh et al., 2011), a marked suppression of 
hyperglucagonaemia was observed in the present study, which
would thereby reduce hepatic glucose production and 
postprandial hyperglycaemia (Dunning and Gerich, 2007). Thus,
as for amylin agonism (Mack et al., 2011), oral sCT treatment
improved postprandial glycaemic control by delaying gastric
emptying and exerting a glucagonostatic action.
The primary target of action of amylin agonism appears to
be mediated by a central mechanism involving the area 
pos-trema with amylin binding sites present on the vagal nuclei
in the brain (Lutz et al., 1998; Potes et al., 2010). 
Alternatively, the amylin-like effect of oral sCT upon gastric 
emptying and hyperglucagonaemia could be mediated through the
incretin hormone GLP-1 (Holst et al., 2008). However, we
observed that oral sCT treatment reduced plasma levels of
total GLP-1 throughout the study period. Thus, as regards the
amylin-like effects of oral sCT, the likely site of action is
through centrally located amylin receptors.
Importantly, in contrast to amylin, sCT is known to elicit
a dual agonist effect, as it binds to and activates both the
calcitonin receptor (CT receptor) and the amylin receptor
(AMY receptor), and, interestingly, with stronger binding
affinity than amylin itself. Thus, by binding to and activating
both the CT receptor and the AMY receptor, sCT elicits
responses in multiple organs (Hay et al., 2004; 2005), thus
providing one potential explanation for the potent ability of
sCT to improve glucose metabolism.
A novel finding in the present study is the insulinotropic
action exerted by oral sCT in the basal state, thereby 
markedly improving glucose homeostasis. As mentioned above,
the present data do not indicate an incretin effect mediating
this sustained hyperinsulinaemia in ZDF rats (Kiec-Klimczak
et al., 2011), as oral sCT treatment did not enhance levels of
GLP-1 and GIP. In contrast, oral sCT, by following the 
endogenous physiological pathway and thereby resulting in higher
drug concentrations in the splanchnic circulation could cause
160 British Journal of Pharmacology (2012) 167 151-163
pronounced exposure to receptors and nerves located in the
pancreatic and portal area. In support of this hypothesis,
stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents resulting in 
hypotha-lamic mediated insulin secretion has been demonstrated to
improve hyperglycaemia in ZDF rats (Chen et al., 2010).
Additionally, in preliminary experiments, the CT receptor
was localized by immunohistochemistry as being dispersed
throughout the pancreas islet including beta cells (unpub-
lished data). However, sCT exposure in isolated islets from
lean healthy rats, although inducing a cAMP response, did
not potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (unpub-
lished data). Thus, we speculate, that oral sCT could function
as a direct and/or indirect insulinotropic peptide and thereby
improve glucose homeostasis in severely diabetic animals,
although this awaits further investigations with a more
mechanistic approach.
The hyperphagia of ZDF rats is a result of dysfunctional
leptin signalling as well as caloric wasting because of marked
glucosuria (Etgen and Oldham, 2000). Surprisingly, in the
present study, we did not observe a reduction in body weight,
despite a trend towards a reduction in food intake, which
contrasts with our previous findings in diet-induced obese
rats (Feigh et al., 2011) and with the well-described anorectic
action typically observed for sCT and amylin (Roth et al.,
2006; 2008; Chelikani et al., 2007). Interestingly, the effects
of amylin and sCT as regards energy balance are known to be
attenuated in leptin deficient systems, such as ob/ob mice,
ZDF and fa/fa rats (Eiden et al., 2002; Trevaskis et al., 2010). In
contrast, in diet-induced obesity-related leptin resistance, an
amylin-mediated restoration of leptin responsiveness has
been extensively demonstrated in rodent models (Trevaskis
et al., 2008; 2010; Turek et al., 2010). From a therapeutic
perspective, only very few humans worldwide present with
genetically based leptin deficiency, whereas the majority of
obese people presents with leptin resistance; thus, combined
leptin/amylin agonism has now gone through clinical trials
as a potential approach to obesity drug development (Chan
et al., 2009). A thorough study in ob/ob and db/db mice, 
representing leptin deficiency versus leptin receptor defect,
respectively, would be required to fully interpret the lack of
effect on body weight during oral sCT treatment. 
Additionally, the positive effect on energy balance despite a decrease
in food intake could be due to a reduction in glucosuria
because of marked improvement in glycaemic control, as also
previously observed in severely diabetic ZDF rats (Larsen
et al., 2008).
Of note, although oral sCT treatment markedly improved
glycaemic control, irrespective of inducing weight loss, the
impressive glucoregulatory effect lessened towards the end of
the study period. To our knowledge, only very few studies
have investigated anti-diabetic efficacy of monotherapeutic
interventions in severely diabetic ZDF rats. At 18 weeks of
age, the vehicle-treated rats demonstrated a pronounced 
diabetic hyperglycaemic state with pancreatic islet destruction.
Thus, in analogy to human type 2 diabetes (Kruger et al.,
2011), we speculate that combination therapy could be a
prerequisite for sustained glycaemic control in late-stage 
diabetic ZDF rats. In support of this theory, the GLP-1 analogue
liraglutide improved glycaemic control only in combination
therapy with the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone in severely
diabetic ZDF rats, although the glucoregulatory efficacy, in
line with the present study, lessened towards the end of the
study period (~17 weeks of age) (Larsen et al., 2008). Thus, an
investigation into the anti-diabetic efficacy of oral sCT in
combination therapy is warranted. Furthermore, we speculate
that the lack of effect of oral sCT treatment on weight loss in
the ZDF rat, possibly due to leptin deficient signalling, could
influence the chronic anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy. It is well
known that a reduction in caloric consumption in type 2
diabetic patients by pharmacological intervention is 
accompanied by improved glycaemic control (Rowe et al., 2005;
Scheen et al., 2006), and supporting this, oral sCT treatment
induced a pronounced vehicle-corrected weight loss (~15%)
and markedly improved obesity-related insulin resistance and
sustained glycaemic control in leptin-resistant DIO rats
(Feigh et al., 2011).
To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the
effect of amylin agonists on pancreatic beta-cell function and
area in a severely diabetic animal model, and these data
strongly support the notion that oral sCT possesses a potent
ability to prevent beta-cell degradation and preserve secretory
function. Interestingly, amylin treatment does not protect
against beta-cell loss (Edelman et al., 2008; Trevaskis et al.,
2010), which could indicate that the effect of sCT is primarily
mediated through the calcitonin receptor, rather than the
amylin receptor. Alternatively, the oral route of 
administration allows the sCT to have an effect on the pancreas;
however, this requires further studies.
In conclusion, these data for the first time show that in
severely diabetic ZDF rats, (i) oral sCT attenuates the 
development of diabetic hyperglycaemia, (ii) oral sCT improves
postprandial glycaemic control through delaying gastric
emptying, (iii) oral sCT exerts a basal state insulinotropic and
glucagonostatic action and (iv) oral sCT induces a 
pronounced improvement in beta-cell health and function. The
oral formulation of sCT thus appears to possess insulin-like
effects and our results highlight the importance of following
the physiological pathway of endogenous secretion when
attempting to mimic the action of gut hormones.
