>>>section: conclusion
Conclusion
PEG-PSL, both in the dosage and the route of 
administration used in this study’s experimental model, showed no
suppression of the chronic inflammation induced by CIA,
even in vitro after stimulation of macrophages. However,
the results herein indicate that perhaps the severe arthritis
induced by CIA in our model, presenting high levels of
TGF-β1 and other inflammatory cytokines in all the
groups, could be an important variable to explore as to
the mechanism of action of PEG-PSL, which is still not
fully understood.
Further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the
therapeutic intervention of PEG-PSL in the experimental
CIA model and in the acute model, employing other 
alternatives than the dosage and route of administration. A new
approach using PEG-PSL as a therapeutic adjuvant 
combined with a biological medicine with proven therapeutic
efficacy can also be explored in future studies. New 
promoter routes that regulate synovial molecules must also be
characterized to corroborate these PEG-PSL study findings
as a new therapeutic tool in inflammatory diseases.

Methods
Ethical aspects
All experiments were performed according to the Guiding
Principles for Research Involving Animals (NAS) and
approved by the Committee of Research and Ethics in
Health of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (Porto
Alegre, Brazil).
Materials
Phosphatidylcholine (PC), PS and 1.2 diesterol-sn-glycero-
3-phosphatidylethanolamine-N- (polyethylene glycol)-2000
(DSPE-Peg2000) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids,
Alabaster, AL, USA. The type II (CII) bovine collagen was
acquired from Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA. Freund’s
complete adjuvant (CFA), E. coli 0111:B4, phorbol 
myris-tate acetate (PMA) and protease inhibitor cocktail (P1860)
were purchased from Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA. 
Inactivated mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37RA was
obtained from Difco, Detroit, MI, USA. The RAW 264.7
(ATCC® TIB-71™) macrophage strain, fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium)
were obtained from Gibco®, Grand Island, NY, USA. 
Isoflur-ane was obtained from Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA. The BD
Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 
Cytokine Kit and the Mouse IL-1β ELISA Set Kit were obtained
from Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA. The
Mouse TGF-β1 Platinum ELISA Kit was obtained from
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA.
Liposomes
Liposomes composed of PC, PS and DSPE-PEG2000 in
a molar ratio of 68:30:2, respectively, were produced by
Encapsula Nanosciences (Brentwood, TN, USA) following
the process described below.
The phospholipids were added in the desired molar 
ratios in chloroform/methanol (90:10) and then were dried
in an atmosphere of nitrogen. They were then suspended
in PBS (pH7.4) in the transition temperature of the 
phos-pholipids and then underwent extrusion with porous 
poly-carbonate membrane, measuring approximately 100 nm.
The suspension was passed through the membrane 11
times until the formation of unilamellar liposomes with a
diameter of 100 nm (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern,
Westborough, MA, USA). Liposomes were stored in flasks
with PBS (pH7.4) degassed at 4 °C and purged with argon.
Under these conditions the effects of hydrolysis and
oxidation are minimized.
Animals
Female DBA/1j mice from 8 to 12 weeks of age were
used. The animals were reared at ± 20 °C, with 12-h
light/dark cycles and free access to food and water.
Immunization protocol for bovine collagen type II mice
Polyarthritis by CIA in mice was induced according to
the methodology proposed by Brand et al. [27].
Bovine type II collagen (CII) was dissolved in 0.1 M
acetic acid at 4 °C for 12 h (2 mg/ml). CFA 
supplemented to 4 mg/ml of inactivated Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (strain H37RA) was used [27]. CII (2 mg/mL)
and CFA (4 mg/mL) were mixed in equal volumes to
form an emulsion. CIA was induced by CII on day zero,
via intradermal immunization (id) of 50 μL of emulsion
at the base of the tail. On the 18th day, the mice 
received a booster in another part of the tail, following the
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 3 of 11
same protocol, but with the incomplete Freund adjuvant
(IFA), id. The animals were given Isoflurane anesthesia
by inhalation for the immunizations and euthanize.
Finally, at the end of treatment, animals were 
eutha-nized by cervical dislocation. The knees were cut and
preserved at −80 °C for cytokine analysis of the joint,
while the legs were preserved in formalin for histological
analysis.
Treatment
The treatments with PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day
were started on the same day as the booster.
The CIA animals were divided into four experimental
groups (n = 6/group): treatment vehicle (saline 0.9 %)
daily subcutaneously (sc) or PEG-PSL 5 mg/kg/day sc;
PEG-PSL 10 mg/kg/day sc; and PEG-PSL 15 mg/kg/day,
sc. Either PEG-PSL or vehicle 100 μL were applied 
subcutaneously in the neck area for twenty days following
the booster.
The doses used in this study were employed based on
studies using PSL in an acute inflammatory arthropathy
model [13, 14].
Clinical score
A blinded observer performed subjective analysis of the
clinical severity score during the treatment period. The
degree of swelling of the anterior and posterior legs of
the animals was evaluated using a scale of 0 to 4 for
each limb. To assess the progression of the disease in an
animal, a scale of 0 to 16 was used, using the sum of the
scores of all four limbs of each animal.
Histological analysis
The tibiotarsal joints of the DBA/1J animals were
isolated and immersed in 10 % buffered formalin for 
fixation for 24 h. Next, the tissues were decalcified in 10 %
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for approximately 18 h. These
tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Slices 6 μm thick were arranged on microscope slides.
The slides were stained using hematoxylin and eosin 
technique for analysis of the following parameters: synovial 
inflammation: (five high-power magnification fields - HMF)
were analyzed for the percentage of infiltrating 
mono-nuclear cells: 0- absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate
(11-50 %), 3- severe (51-100 %); synovial hyperplasia:
0- absent, 1- mild (5-10 layers of cells), 2- moderate
(11-50 layers), 3- severe (>20 layers); extension of pannus
formation: 0- absent, 1- mild, 2- moderate, 3- severe;
synovial fibrosis: 0- absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate
(11-50 %), 3- severe (51-100 %); erosion of cartilage: 
0-absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate (11-50 %), 
3-severe (51-100 %); bone erosion: 0- none, 1- minor
erosion/s observed only under HMF, 2- moderate erosion/
s observed under low amplification, 3- serious 
transcor-tical erosion/s grave conforming to the previous 
description [28] and for the analysis of cartilage degradation,
safranin-O staining was conducted. All slices were 
microscopically analyzed by two blinded observers, and the
images were captured by digital camera [28].
Immunomodulation in vitro of PEG-PSL in macrophages
stimulated with LPS/PMA
The macrophage cell culture (RAW 264.7 - ATCC®
TIB-71™) was maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium) containing 4500 mg glycose/L, L-glutamine
and phenol red at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. The medium was
supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), plus
penicillin 1 U/mL and streptomycin 1 μg/mL. The cells
were cultivated in 96-well culture plates with a density of
5 × 104 per well.
The macrophages were stimulated with 100 ng/mL of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 10 ng/mL of PMA for 12 h
prior to treatment (Table 1).
The treatment with 100 μM of PEG-PSL lasted 24 h,
after stimulation for 12 h with LPS/PMA. After culturing,
the supernatant was recovered to measure the levels of
cytokines which were quantified by cytometric bead array
(CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Evaluation of cytokine production - IL-1β and TGF-β1
by ELISA
For the quantification of IL-1β, the Mouse IL-1β ELISA
Set Kit was used. For analysis of TGF-β1 levels, the Mouse
TGF-β1 Platinum ELISA Kit was used.
For evaluation of the production of IL-1β and TGF-β1
in the in vivo study, the knee joints of the animals were
homogenized by Polytron™ Homogenizers (Kinematica
Inc., Keyland Court Bohemia, NY, USA) at 4 °C with
sterile PBS (pH7.4) with protease inhibitor (Protease 
Inhibitor Cocktail).
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 4 of 11
The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g per 10 min
[28]. The supernatant was collected for analysis. For
evaluation of production of IL-1β and TGF-β1 in the
in vitro experiment, Supernatants of the macrophage
cultures were harvested after the treatment and used
in the assay. The methodology followed the kit 
manu-facturer’s specifications.
Assessment of the Th1/Th2 and Th17 profile by CBA
The concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
IL-17A, IL-10 were measured, of the macerated tissue of the
knee joints of the animals in the in vivo study and the
supernatant of macrophage cultures of the in vitro 
experiment, with the BD Cytometric Bead Array Mouse Th1/
Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit. Data were obtained by flow 
cytometry using the BD FACSCalibur and analyzed using the
FCAP3.0™ software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA).
Statistical analysis
For analysis of the clinical scores, the comparison of the
groups was obtained using a nonlinear model, using the
R software (R Project for Statistical Computing - Federal
University of Paraná), with the following formula:
A
1þ e− x−xoð
Þ=5
Where:
A = Asymptote
-(x-xo)/5 = Half-life
5 = Scale
The results were described by value, standard error,
t-value and p-value (≤0.05).
To assess the relationship between cytokine production
in vivo and in vitro experimental groups, the 
Kruskal-Wallis test and later, the unpaired Wilcoxon test were
used. For histological analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test and
Dunn’s Multiple Comparison test were used. GraphPad
Pris software version 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad 
Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used.

Abstract
Background: Phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes (PSL) have been shown to reduce inflammation in experimental
models of acute arthritis, by mimicking the apoptotic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
pegylated PSL (PEG-PSL) on chronic inflammation of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice.
Methods: CIA was induced in 24 DBA/1J mice (n = 6/group), which were divided into control (0.9 % saline) or treated
with PEG-PSL (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously for 20 days). Clinical score, limb histology and measurement of
cytokines in knee joints of animals by ELISA and cytometric bead array (CBA) were evaluated. The in vitro study employed
macrophage cultures stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS plus 10 ng/ml of PMA and treated with 100 μM PEG-PSL.
Results: Resolution of the disease in vivo and the inflammatory process in vitro were not observed. PEG-PSL, in doses of
10 and 15 mg/kg, were not shown to reduce the score of the disease in animals, whereas with the dose of 5 mg/kg,
the animals did not show the advanced stage of the disease when compared to the controls. The PEG- PSL 5,
10 and 15 mg/kg treatment groups did not show significant reduction of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and IFN-γ when
compared to the controls. Disease incidence and animal weights were not affected by treatment. Regarding the paw
histology, PEG-PSL did not yield any reductions in the infiltrating mononuclear, synovial hyperplasia, extension of pannus
formation, synovial fibrosis, erosion of cartilage, bone erosion or cartilage degradation. The concentration of 100 μM of
PEG-PSL has not been shown to reduce inflammation induced by LPS/PMA in the in vitro study. Treated groups did not
show any reduction in inflammatory cytokines in the knee joints of animals affected by the disease compared to the
control, although there were higher concentrations of TGF-β1 in all experimental groups.
Conclusion: The experimental model showed an expression of severe arthritis after the booster. TGF-β1 as well other
pro inflammatory cytokines were presented in high concentrations in all groups. PEG-PSL had no impact on the clinical
score, the histopathology from tibial-tarsal joints or the production of cytokines in the knee joints. Other alternatives
such as dosage, route of administration, and as an adjunct to a drug already on the market, should be evaluated to
support the use of PEG-PSL as a new therapeutic tool in inflammatory diseases.

Background
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid found in the
inner part of the plasma membrane of viable cells [1]. In
the process of apoptosis, PS is externalized and 
presented as a phagocytic signal for macrophage-mediated
removal of apoptotic bodies, contributing to the 
homeostasis of the organism [1-5].

However, it is not only the organism that enjoys the
benefits of PS. Some protozoa mimic the exposure of PS to
be phagocytosed and begin the process of infection in
macrophages, mainly by inhibiting nitric oxide and 
stimulating TGF-β1 and IL-10 [6-8]. Toxoplasma gondii [6, 8],
Leishmania ssp [7, 9, 10], and trypomastigote forms of
Trypanosoma cruzi [8], frequently employ this strategy.
There are also reports of tumoral cells which excessively
exhibit PS to promote immunosuppression of the immune
system, allowing their development without interference
from the organism [11].

Given these facts, in recent years the use of PS 
liposomes (PSL) has been shown to reduce inflammation in
models of acute experimental arthritis [12-14]. One
possible explanation for such an effect is that the 
apoptotic mimicking effect is triggered by a linking between
PS and T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptors (TIM-1
and TIM-4) [2, 15, 16] and other receptors [17], mainly
present in macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis of the
vesicles and promotion of an anti-inflammatory response
through the production of TGF-β and IL-10 [18].
Huynh et al. [18] were pioneers in demonstrating the
reduction of in vivo inflammation using PSL, and still 
suggest that TGF-β is fundamental in the anti-inflammatory
response.
Other studies have used PSL as an inhibitor of 
inflammation in carrageenan-induced arthritis model in mice
(100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) [12], for ischemia 
prevention in mice (5 mg/kg) [19], as an inhibitor of 
immunogenicity of recombinant molecules [20-22], for
myocardial infarction in mice (5 mg/kg)[23] and even
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the
delivery routes of encapsulated drugs in mice, in
addition to the use of pegylated PSLs (PEG-PSL) to
maximize the anti-inflammatory effects [24]. 
Moreover, the consistent findings of Wu et al. [13] and
Ma et al. [14] showed the intervention of PSL (5 mg/kg,
intramuscular) in experimental arthritis in rats by 
inhibiting inflammation and bone loss in rats with 
adjuvant-induced arthritis.
Still unknown is the effect of PSL in the model of bovine
collagen-induced chronic arthritis (CIA). The structural
lesions in CIA are most analogous to human rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), thus an excellent option for pre-clinical
drug studies [25]. CIA depends on adaptive and humoral
immunity (T and B cells) and the complement system for
disease induction [26, 27].
In light of the possibility of mimicking apoptosis and
reducing the inflammatory process, the present study
evaluated the effect of PEG-PSL in the CIA model, to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of PEG-PSL in the
chronic phase of experimental arthritis in order to outline
future applications in human autoimmune diseases.

used. The animals were reared at ± 20 °C, with 12-h
light/dark cycles and free access to food and water.
Immunization protocol for bovine collagen type II mice
Polyarthritis by CIA in mice was induced according to
the methodology proposed by Brand et al. [27].
Bovine type II collagen (CII) was dissolved in 0.1 M
acetic acid at 4 °C for 12 h (2 mg/ml). CFA 
supplemented to 4 mg/ml of inactivated Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (strain H37RA) was used [27]. CII (2 mg/mL)
and CFA (4 mg/mL) were mixed in equal volumes to
form an emulsion. CIA was induced by CII on day zero,
via intradermal immunization (id) of 50 μL of emulsion
at the base of the tail. On the 18th day, the mice 
received a booster in another part of the tail, following the
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 3 of 11
same protocol, but with the incomplete Freund adjuvant
(IFA), id. The animals were given Isoflurane anesthesia
by inhalation for the immunizations and euthanize.
Finally, at the end of treatment, animals were 
eutha-nized by cervical dislocation. The knees were cut and
preserved at −80 °C for cytokine analysis of the joint,
while the legs were preserved in formalin for histological
analysis.
Treatment
The treatments with PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day
were started on the same day as the booster.
The CIA animals were divided into four experimental
groups (n = 6/group): treatment vehicle (saline 0.9 %)
daily subcutaneously (sc) or PEG-PSL 5 mg/kg/day sc;
PEG-PSL 10 mg/kg/day sc; and PEG-PSL 15 mg/kg/day,
sc. Either PEG-PSL or vehicle 100 μL were applied 
subcutaneously in the neck area for twenty days following
the booster.
The doses used in this study were employed based on
studies using PSL in an acute inflammatory arthropathy
model [13, 14].
Clinical score
A blinded observer performed subjective analysis of the
clinical severity score during the treatment period. The
degree of swelling of the anterior and posterior legs of
the animals was evaluated using a scale of 0 to 4 for
each limb. To assess the progression of the disease in an
animal, a scale of 0 to 16 was used, using the sum of the
scores of all four limbs of each animal.
Histological analysis
The tibiotarsal joints of the DBA/1J animals were
isolated and immersed in 10 % buffered formalin for 
fixation for 24 h. Next, the tissues were decalcified in 10 %
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for approximately 18 h. These
tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Slices 6 μm thick were arranged on microscope slides.
The slides were stained using hematoxylin and eosin 
technique for analysis of the following parameters: synovial 
inflammation: (five high-power magnification fields - HMF)
were analyzed for the percentage of infiltrating 
mono-nuclear cells: 0- absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate
(11-50 %), 3- severe (51-100 %); synovial hyperplasia:
0- absent, 1- mild (5-10 layers of cells), 2- moderate
(11-50 layers), 3- severe (>20 layers); extension of pannus
formation: 0- absent, 1- mild, 2- moderate, 3- severe;
synovial fibrosis: 0- absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate
(11-50 %), 3- severe (51-100 %); erosion of cartilage: 
0-absent, 1- mild (1-10 %), 2- moderate (11-50 %), 
3-severe (51-100 %); bone erosion: 0- none, 1- minor
erosion/s observed only under HMF, 2- moderate erosion/
s observed under low amplification, 3- serious 
transcor-tical erosion/s grave conforming to the previous 
description [28] and for the analysis of cartilage degradation,
safranin-O staining was conducted. All slices were 
microscopically analyzed by two blinded observers, and the
images were captured by digital camera [28].
Immunomodulation in vitro of PEG-PSL in macrophages
stimulated with LPS/PMA
The macrophage cell culture (RAW 264.7 - ATCC®
TIB-71™) was maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium) containing 4500 mg glycose/L, L-glutamine
and phenol red at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. The medium was
supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), plus
penicillin 1 U/mL and streptomycin 1 μg/mL. The cells
were cultivated in 96-well culture plates with a density of
5 × 104 per well.
The macrophages were stimulated with 100 ng/mL of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 10 ng/mL of PMA for 12 h
prior to treatment (Table 1).
The treatment with 100 μM of PEG-PSL lasted 24 h,
after stimulation for 12 h with LPS/PMA. After culturing,
the supernatant was recovered to measure the levels of
cytokines which were quantified by cytometric bead array
(CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Evaluation of cytokine production - IL-1β and TGF-β1
by ELISA
For the quantification of IL-1β, the Mouse IL-1β ELISA
Set Kit was used. For analysis of TGF-β1 levels, the Mouse
TGF-β1 Platinum ELISA Kit was used.
For evaluation of the production of IL-1β and TGF-β1
in the in vivo study, the knee joints of the animals were
homogenized by Polytron™ Homogenizers (Kinematica
Inc., Keyland Court Bohemia, NY, USA) at 4 °C with
sterile PBS (pH7.4) with protease inhibitor (Protease 
Inhibitor Cocktail).
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 4 of 11
The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g per 10 min
[28]. The supernatant was collected for analysis. For
evaluation of production of IL-1β and TGF-β1 in the
in vitro experiment, Supernatants of the macrophage
cultures were harvested after the treatment and used
in the assay. The methodology followed the kit 
manu-facturer’s specifications.
Assessment of the Th1/Th2 and Th17 profile by CBA
The concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
IL-17A, IL-10 were measured, of the macerated tissue of the
knee joints of the animals in the in vivo study and the
supernatant of macrophage cultures of the in vitro 
experiment, with the BD Cytometric Bead Array Mouse Th1/
Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit. Data were obtained by flow 
cytometry using the BD FACSCalibur and analyzed using the
FCAP3.0™ software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA).
Statistical analysis
For analysis of the clinical scores, the comparison of the
groups was obtained using a nonlinear model, using the
R software (R Project for Statistical Computing - Federal
University of Paraná), with the following formula:
A
1þ e− x−xoð
Þ=5
Where:
A = Asymptote
-(x-xo)/5 = Half-life
5 = Scale
The results were described by value, standard error,
t-value and p-value (≤0.05).
To assess the relationship between cytokine production
in vivo and in vitro experimental groups, the 
Kruskal-Wallis test and later, the unpaired Wilcoxon test were
used. For histological analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test and
Dunn’s Multiple Comparison test were used. GraphPad
Pris software version 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad 
Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used.
Results
Effect of PEG-PSL treatment on the animals’ clinical score
Figure 1 shows the dynamics of disease progression based
on the evaluation of the daily clinical score. The trajectory
of each individual is illustrated via the colored dots during
the treatment period and shows some heterogeneity in the
DBA/1J strain of mice used in this study.
Incidence of the disease was 100 %, evidencing a 
universal induction of arthritis in this study. By day 14 
following the booster, all animals were afflicted.
Considering the length of treatment (20 days) and the
daily administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of PEG-PSL,
the results showed no significant difference in the 
reduction of disease progression as assessed by clinical score
between the treatment groups (10 and 15 mg/kg) and the
control group (Fig. 1). The group treated with PEG-PSL
5 mg/kg presented an upper asymptote of clinical score
significantly less than the control, i.e., the animals of the
group treated with 5 mg/kg did not show a greater degree
of disease severity (Fig. 1 and Table 2), evidencing a 
possible effect on the delay of disease activity.
The coefficient half-life (the time it took the 
experimental groups to present an elevated disease score in half the
total experiment time) demonstrated that the 15 mg/kg
treatment rapidly achieved a high score, compared to the
control (Table 2) and other treatments. One may postulate
that these results are related to the two animals with scores
2 and 3 on day zero and the animal that died on the 
second day after the booster. Although this data could point
to a possible toxic effect of the dose 15 mg/kg, the other
animals in the same group followed a similar disease 
progression compared with other groups. Therefore, it may be
that the animal that died had a heterogeneous 
manifestation of the disease following the CIA protocol.
The scale coefficient, which evaluates the slope of the
curve determining disease progression, detected no 
significant difference between the treatments and the control.
Two of the six animals treated with 5 mg/kg presented
delayed development of the disease, one on the 7th day
after the booster, another animal only on the 13th day, 
affecting the incidence of the disease and the value of the
upper asymptote.
Histopathological analysis of the tibiotarsal joint of mice
with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) treated with PEG-PSL
The histology scores can be observed in graphic (Fig. 2).
Treatment with different doses of PEG-PSL did not
present any improvement regarding the histological 
parameters analyzed. The animals presented marked joint
abnormality with pronounced inflammatory infiltration
(Fig. 2a), synovial hyperplasia (Fig. 2b), extensive pannus
formation (Fig. 2c), severe erosion of cartilage (Fig. 2d)
and bone (Fig. 2e), independent of treatment, with no
statistically significant difference between the groups 
analyzed. Regarding the deterioration of cartilage, analysis
by Safranin-O staining (data not presented) showed that
there was no reduction in this symptom by the
treatment as compared to the control, indicating that
PEG-PSL did not protect from cartilage deterioration.
Levels of TNF-α in the knee joints of the animals did not
show any reduction in groups PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg,
compared to the control
The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and
IFN-γ in the knee joints of the animals at the end of the
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 5 of 11
experiment did not present significantly reduced levels
in the PEG-PSL treated groups compared with the 
control (Fig. 3).
Concentrations of IL-17 and IL-10 were not present in
detectable levels. Levels of TGF-β1 in the groups treated
with PEG-PSL did not show significance relative to the
control, however, analysis showed enhanced of levels in
the PEG-PSL groups (Fig. 3f). Despite the lack of statistical
significance between treated and control groups, the
Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference of 5 %
for the variable TNF-α (Fig. 3e), although the difference is
related to the contrasts PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg
(Fig. 3e). However, in comparison to the control, group
PEG-PSL 10 mg/kg showed no statistical significance.
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 6 of 11
The data A (asymptote), MED (half-life) and S (scale) are correlated to their respective controls as designated in the table Intercepta. One individual in the PEG-PSL
15 mg/kg group died (a) one day after the booster. P-value < 0.05 (*) and < 0.0001 (***)
In vitro, PEG-PSL 100 μM did not inhibit the inflammatory
process induced by LPS/PMA
In in vitro experiments using macrophages (RAW 264.7),
there was no reduction of TNF-α, IL-6 per CBA in
cultures stimulated with LPS/PMA when treated with
PEG-LSP 100 μM.
The analysis by CBA did not allow detection of IL-2,
IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10. More sensitive methods
should be used for this evaluation. The TGF-β1 
evaluated by ELISA did not present significantly distinct
levels between treated groups and the control (Fig. 4c).
The results clearly show the pro-inflammatory effect
of LPS and PMA in the cultures (Fig. 4a, b and d). The
Wilcoxon nonparametric t-test was again used to show
any differences in the TNF-α response vis-à-vis contrast
(treatment) (Fig. 4a).
The untreated culture groups, PBS and PEG-PSL
100 μM, showed significant difference regarding the
expression of TNF-α in the supernatant compared to
groups treated with LPS and PMA. PSL-PEG 100 μM did
not achieve significant reduction of TNF-α compared to
the untreated and PBS groups, though it was not toxic to
macrophage culture (Fig. 4a).
Cultures stimulated with LPS and PMA, as expected,
had elevated levels of TNF-α compared to non-stimulated
groups, though none of the groups (LPS + PMA, LPS +
PMA + PBS and LPS + PMA + PEG-PSL 100 μM) showed
any significant difference in the concentration of TNF-α
(Fig. 4a), demonstrating that PEG-PSL at a concentration
of 100 μM did not reduce the pro-inflammatory effect 
induced by LPS and PMA.
For the IL-1β response (Fig. 4d), the Wilcoxon 
nonparametric t-test was also used to show any difference in the
response vis-à-vis contrasts (treatments), however, the test
showed no statistical difference between groups.
Discussion
Apoptotic mimicking based on the use of PSL has
been shown to reduce the inflammatory process in 
experimental models of acute arthritis [5, 12-14]. This
study is the first of kind, evaluating the effect of 
administration of PEG-PSL (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) in the
experimental model of chronic arthritis (CIA), through
analysis of clinical scores, levels of cytokines in the knee
joints of the animals, disease incidence, histology of the
paws and in vitro study using macrophages (RAW 264.7)
stimulated with LPS/PMA.
The experiment setup has been designed to answer
the main question: does PEG-PSL affect the 
inflammatory response trigged by CIA in DBA/1J mice?
As previously described, no significant differences 
between the untreated animals and those treated with 
PEG-PSL were detected regarding cytokine expression, clinical
score, histological evaluation, and even in in vitro assays
upon LPS/PMA stimulation.
The present experimental approach has shown some
peculiarities compared with previous experiments, which
certainly could be critical to the results presented.
Intramuscular administration of PSL offered some 
positive results in previous experiments conducted by Wu et
al. [13] and Ma et al. [14] in adjuvant-induced arthritis
(AIA) in rats. Mice, unlike rats, have a relatively tiny
muscle mass in the thigh, therefore, the choice of 
subcutaneous administration for this study was based on the 
extreme difficulty of daily intramuscular administration of
PSL, where the injection itself which would be likely to
cause extreme pain and regional swelling.
The advantage of the intramuscular route is that PSL
is rapidly absorbed, increasing the PSL concentration in
the blood. Conversely, subcutaneous administration 
generally provides a slower absorption that could limit the

systemic effect of PSL. In order to reduce PSL local
response in the dermis, and increase a systemic response
by enhancing concentration and time of PSL circulation in
the blood, PEGylation was chosen as a viable alternative.
According to previous studies, incorporation of 2 mol%
PEG in PSL does not affect the interaction of PS with
macrophages and consequently PSL internalization, since
at least 10-15 mol% of PEG would be needed to 
completely shield the liposomes from any interactions with
proteins [29, 30]. Even 5 mol% PEG has been shown to
have no effect on PSL-macrophages interaction [24]. 
However the need for studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 10 of 11
and accumulation of PEG-PSL in the periarticular tissue
should be considered. The necessity of PEG-PSL in the
inflamed region has not yet been evaluated by previous
studies, but certainly, the route of administration has an
important impact on the action of PEG-PSL.
The PSL dose used in our experiments is another 
critical factor that might affect the efficacy of PSL in CIA.
Commonly used, 5 mg/kg of PSL has been shown to 
prevent ischemia in mice (5 mg/mg) [19], myocardial 
infarction in mice [23] and impact on AIA experimental model
in rats [13, 14]. However, a carrageenan-induced arthritis
model in mice used PSL 100 mg/kg via intraperitoneal
[12], showed positive results. Therefore, it may be 
necessary to use a more sensitive titration assay and different
administration routes to demonstrate any positive effects
of PEG-PSL in future experiments in the CIA model.
Conclusion
PEG-PSL, both in the dosage and the route of 
administration used in this study’s experimental model, showed no
suppression of the chronic inflammation induced by CIA,
even in vitro after stimulation of macrophages. However,
the results herein indicate that perhaps the severe arthritis
induced by CIA in our model, presenting high levels of
TGF-β1 and other inflammatory cytokines in all the
groups, could be an important variable to explore as to
the mechanism of action of PEG-PSL, which is still not
fully understood.
Further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the
therapeutic intervention of PEG-PSL in the experimental
CIA model and in the acute model, employing other 
alternatives than the dosage and route of administration. A new
approach using PEG-PSL as a therapeutic adjuvant 
combined with a biological medicine with proven therapeutic
efficacy can also be explored in future studies. New 
promoter routes that regulate synovial molecules must also be
characterized to corroborate these PEG-PSL study findings
as a new therapeutic tool in inflammatory diseases.

Abstract
Background: Phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes (PSL) have been shown to reduce inflammation in experimental
models of acute arthritis, by mimicking the apoptotic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
pegylated PSL (PEG-PSL) on chronic inflammation of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice.
Methods: CIA was induced in 24 DBA/1J mice (n = 6/group), which were divided into control (0.9 % saline) or treated
with PEG-PSL (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously for 20 days). Clinical score, limb histology and measurement of
cytokines in knee joints of animals by ELISA and cytometric bead array (CBA) were evaluated. The in vitro study employed
macrophage cultures stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS plus 10 ng/ml of PMA and treated with 100 μM PEG-PSL.
Results: Resolution of the disease in vivo and the inflammatory process in vitro were not observed. PEG-PSL, in doses of
10 and 15 mg/kg, were not shown to reduce the score of the disease in animals, whereas with the dose of 5 mg/kg,
the animals did not show the advanced stage of the disease when compared to the controls. The PEG- PSL 5,
10 and 15 mg/kg treatment groups did not show significant reduction of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and IFN-γ when
compared to the controls. Disease incidence and animal weights were not affected by treatment. Regarding the paw
histology, PEG-PSL did not yield any reductions in the infiltrating mononuclear, synovial hyperplasia, extension of pannus
formation, synovial fibrosis, erosion of cartilage, bone erosion or cartilage degradation. The concentration of 100 μM of
PEG-PSL has not been shown to reduce inflammation induced by LPS/PMA in the in vitro study. Treated groups did not
show any reduction in inflammatory cytokines in the knee joints of animals affected by the disease compared to the
control, although there were higher concentrations of TGF-β1 in all experimental groups.
Conclusion: The experimental model showed an expression of severe arthritis after the booster. TGF-β1 as well other
pro inflammatory cytokines were presented in high concentrations in all groups. PEG-PSL had no impact on the clinical
score, the histopathology from tibial-tarsal joints or the production of cytokines in the knee joints. Other alternatives
such as dosage, route of administration, and as an adjunct to a drug already on the market, should be evaluated to
support the use of PEG-PSL as a new therapeutic tool in inflammatory diseases.

Background
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid found in the
inner part of the plasma membrane of viable cells [1]. In
the process of apoptosis, PS is externalized and 
presented as a phagocytic signal for macrophage-mediated
removal of apoptotic bodies, contributing to the 
homeostasis of the organism [1-5].

However, it is not only the organism that enjoys the
benefits of PS. Some protozoa mimic the exposure of PS to
be phagocytosed and begin the process of infection in
macrophages, mainly by inhibiting nitric oxide and 
stimulating TGF-β1 and IL-10 [6-8]. Toxoplasma gondii [6, 8],
Leishmania ssp [7, 9, 10], and trypomastigote forms of
Trypanosoma cruzi [8], frequently employ this strategy.
There are also reports of tumoral cells which excessively
exhibit PS to promote immunosuppression of the immune
system, allowing their development without interference
from the organism [11].

Given these facts, in recent years the use of PS 
liposomes (PSL) has been shown to reduce inflammation in
models of acute experimental arthritis [12-14]. One
possible explanation for such an effect is that the 
apoptotic mimicking effect is triggered by a linking between
PS and T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptors (TIM-1
and TIM-4) [2, 15, 16] and other receptors [17], mainly
present in macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis of the
vesicles and promotion of an anti-inflammatory response
through the production of TGF-β and IL-10 [18].
Huynh et al. [18] were pioneers in demonstrating the
reduction of in vivo inflammation using PSL, and still 
suggest that TGF-β is fundamental in the anti-inflammatory
response.
Other studies have used PSL as an inhibitor of 
inflammation in carrageenan-induced arthritis model in mice
(100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) [12], for ischemia 
prevention in mice (5 mg/kg) [19], as an inhibitor of 
immunogenicity of recombinant molecules [20-22], for
myocardial infarction in mice (5 mg/kg)[23] and even
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the
delivery routes of encapsulated drugs in mice, in
addition to the use of pegylated PSLs (PEG-PSL) to
maximize the anti-inflammatory effects [24]. 
Moreover, the consistent findings of Wu et al. [13] and
Ma et al. [14] showed the intervention of PSL (5 mg/kg,
intramuscular) in experimental arthritis in rats by 
inhibiting inflammation and bone loss in rats with 
adjuvant-induced arthritis.
Still unknown is the effect of PSL in the model of bovine
collagen-induced chronic arthritis (CIA). The structural
lesions in CIA are most analogous to human rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), thus an excellent option for pre-clinical
drug studies [25]. CIA depends on adaptive and humoral
immunity (T and B cells) and the complement system for
disease induction [26, 27].
In light of the possibility of mimicking apoptosis and
reducing the inflammatory process, the present study
evaluated the effect of PEG-PSL in the CIA model, to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of PEG-PSL in the
chronic phase of experimental arthritis in order to outline
future applications in human autoimmune diseases.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Apoptotic mimicking based on the use of PSL has
been shown to reduce the inflammatory process in 
experimental models of acute arthritis [5, 12-14]. This
study is the first of kind, evaluating the effect of 
administration of PEG-PSL (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) in the
experimental model of chronic arthritis (CIA), through
analysis of clinical scores, levels of cytokines in the knee
joints of the animals, disease incidence, histology of the
paws and in vitro study using macrophages (RAW 264.7)
stimulated with LPS/PMA.
The experiment setup has been designed to answer
the main question: does PEG-PSL affect the 
inflammatory response trigged by CIA in DBA/1J mice?
As previously described, no significant differences 
between the untreated animals and those treated with 
PEG-PSL were detected regarding cytokine expression, clinical
score, histological evaluation, and even in in vitro assays
upon LPS/PMA stimulation.
The present experimental approach has shown some
peculiarities compared with previous experiments, which
certainly could be critical to the results presented.
Intramuscular administration of PSL offered some 
positive results in previous experiments conducted by Wu et
al. [13] and Ma et al. [14] in adjuvant-induced arthritis
(AIA) in rats. Mice, unlike rats, have a relatively tiny
muscle mass in the thigh, therefore, the choice of 
subcutaneous administration for this study was based on the 
extreme difficulty of daily intramuscular administration of
PSL, where the injection itself which would be likely to
cause extreme pain and regional swelling.
The advantage of the intramuscular route is that PSL
is rapidly absorbed, increasing the PSL concentration in
the blood. Conversely, subcutaneous administration 
generally provides a slower absorption that could limit the

systemic effect of PSL. In order to reduce PSL local
response in the dermis, and increase a systemic response
by enhancing concentration and time of PSL circulation in
the blood, PEGylation was chosen as a viable alternative.
According to previous studies, incorporation of 2 mol%
PEG in PSL does not affect the interaction of PS with
macrophages and consequently PSL internalization, since
at least 10-15 mol% of PEG would be needed to 
completely shield the liposomes from any interactions with
proteins [29, 30]. Even 5 mol% PEG has been shown to
have no effect on PSL-macrophages interaction [24]. 
However the need for studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 10 of 11
and accumulation of PEG-PSL in the periarticular tissue
should be considered. The necessity of PEG-PSL in the
inflamed region has not yet been evaluated by previous
studies, but certainly, the route of administration has an
important impact on the action of PEG-PSL.
The PSL dose used in our experiments is another 
critical factor that might affect the efficacy of PSL in CIA.
Commonly used, 5 mg/kg of PSL has been shown to 
prevent ischemia in mice (5 mg/mg) [19], myocardial 
infarction in mice [23] and impact on AIA experimental model
in rats [13, 14]. However, a carrageenan-induced arthritis
model in mice used PSL 100 mg/kg via intraperitoneal
[12], showed positive results. Therefore, it may be 
necessary to use a more sensitive titration assay and different
administration routes to demonstrate any positive effects
of PEG-PSL in future experiments in the CIA model.

Results
Effect of PEG-PSL treatment on the animals’ clinical score
Figure 1 shows the dynamics of disease progression based
on the evaluation of the daily clinical score. The trajectory
of each individual is illustrated via the colored dots during
the treatment period and shows some heterogeneity in the
DBA/1J strain of mice used in this study.
Incidence of the disease was 100 %, evidencing a 
universal induction of arthritis in this study. By day 14 
following the booster, all animals were afflicted.
Considering the length of treatment (20 days) and the
daily administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of PEG-PSL,
the results showed no significant difference in the 
reduction of disease progression as assessed by clinical score
between the treatment groups (10 and 15 mg/kg) and the
control group (Fig. 1). The group treated with PEG-PSL
5 mg/kg presented an upper asymptote of clinical score
significantly less than the control, i.e., the animals of the
group treated with 5 mg/kg did not show a greater degree
of disease severity (Fig. 1 and Table 2), evidencing a 
possible effect on the delay of disease activity.
The coefficient half-life (the time it took the 
experimental groups to present an elevated disease score in half the
total experiment time) demonstrated that the 15 mg/kg
treatment rapidly achieved a high score, compared to the
control (Table 2) and other treatments. One may postulate
that these results are related to the two animals with scores
2 and 3 on day zero and the animal that died on the 
second day after the booster. Although this data could point
to a possible toxic effect of the dose 15 mg/kg, the other
animals in the same group followed a similar disease 
progression compared with other groups. Therefore, it may be
that the animal that died had a heterogeneous 
manifestation of the disease following the CIA protocol.
The scale coefficient, which evaluates the slope of the
curve determining disease progression, detected no 
significant difference between the treatments and the control.
Two of the six animals treated with 5 mg/kg presented
delayed development of the disease, one on the 7th day
after the booster, another animal only on the 13th day, 
affecting the incidence of the disease and the value of the
upper asymptote.
Histopathological analysis of the tibiotarsal joint of mice
with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) treated with PEG-PSL
The histology scores can be observed in graphic (Fig. 2).
Treatment with different doses of PEG-PSL did not
present any improvement regarding the histological 
parameters analyzed. The animals presented marked joint
abnormality with pronounced inflammatory infiltration
(Fig. 2a), synovial hyperplasia (Fig. 2b), extensive pannus
formation (Fig. 2c), severe erosion of cartilage (Fig. 2d)
and bone (Fig. 2e), independent of treatment, with no
statistically significant difference between the groups 
analyzed. Regarding the deterioration of cartilage, analysis
by Safranin-O staining (data not presented) showed that
there was no reduction in this symptom by the
treatment as compared to the control, indicating that
PEG-PSL did not protect from cartilage deterioration.
Levels of TNF-α in the knee joints of the animals did not
show any reduction in groups PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg,
compared to the control
The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and
IFN-γ in the knee joints of the animals at the end of the
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 5 of 11
experiment did not present significantly reduced levels
in the PEG-PSL treated groups compared with the 
control (Fig. 3).
Concentrations of IL-17 and IL-10 were not present in
detectable levels. Levels of TGF-β1 in the groups treated
with PEG-PSL did not show significance relative to the
control, however, analysis showed enhanced of levels in
the PEG-PSL groups (Fig. 3f). Despite the lack of statistical
significance between treated and control groups, the
Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference of 5 %
for the variable TNF-α (Fig. 3e), although the difference is
related to the contrasts PEG-PSL 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg
(Fig. 3e). However, in comparison to the control, group
PEG-PSL 10 mg/kg showed no statistical significance.
Urbano et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:24 Page 6 of 11
The data A (asymptote), MED (half-life) and S (scale) are correlated to their respective controls as designated in the table Intercepta. One individual in the PEG-PSL
15 mg/kg group died (a) one day after the booster. P-value < 0.05 (*) and < 0.0001 (***)
In vitro, PEG-PSL 100 μM did not inhibit the inflammatory
process induced by LPS/PMA
In in vitro experiments using macrophages (RAW 264.7),
there was no reduction of TNF-α, IL-6 per CBA in
cultures stimulated with LPS/PMA when treated with
PEG-LSP 100 μM.
The analysis by CBA did not allow detection of IL-2,
IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10. More sensitive methods
should be used for this evaluation. The TGF-β1 
evaluated by ELISA did not present significantly distinct
levels between treated groups and the control (Fig. 4c).
The results clearly show the pro-inflammatory effect
of LPS and PMA in the cultures (Fig. 4a, b and d). The
Wilcoxon nonparametric t-test was again used to show
any differences in the TNF-α response vis-à-vis contrast
(treatment) (Fig. 4a).
The untreated culture groups, PBS and PEG-PSL
100 μM, showed significant difference regarding the
expression of TNF-α in the supernatant compared to
groups treated with LPS and PMA. PSL-PEG 100 μM did
not achieve significant reduction of TNF-α compared to
the untreated and PBS groups, though it was not toxic to
macrophage culture (Fig. 4a).
Cultures stimulated with LPS and PMA, as expected,
had elevated levels of TNF-α compared to non-stimulated
groups, though none of the groups (LPS + PMA, LPS +
PMA + PBS and LPS + PMA + PEG-PSL 100 μM) showed
any significant difference in the concentration of TNF-α
(Fig. 4a), demonstrating that PEG-PSL at a concentration
of 100 μM did not reduce the pro-inflammatory effect 
induced by LPS and PMA.
For the IL-1β response (Fig. 4d), the Wilcoxon 
nonparametric t-test was also used to show any difference in the
response vis-à-vis contrasts (treatments), however, the test
showed no statistical difference between groups.

Fig. 1 Clinical score of the limbs of animals in the experimental groups. The animals were monitored daily by analysis of clinical signs of arthritis 
as described by Brand et al. [27] using a score for severity, as follows: 0 = no evidence of erythema and swelling, 1 = erythema and mild swelling 
confined to the tarsals or ankle joint, 2 = erythema and mild swelling extending from the ankle to the tarsals, 3 = erythema and moderate swelling 
extending from the ankle to the metatarsal joints, 4 = erythema and severe swelling encompassing the ankle, foot, and digits, or ankylosis of the limb. 
The total score is the average of the scores of all four limbs of each animal from the onset of the disease. Each of the groups contained six 
animals. Each colored dot represents the trajectory of one animal during the 20 treatment days. Nonlinear statistical analysis method was 
used. Three factors were evaluated: asymptote (a), half-life (MED) and scale (S). The results were described by value, standard error, t-value 
and p-value (≤0.05) (see Table 2)
