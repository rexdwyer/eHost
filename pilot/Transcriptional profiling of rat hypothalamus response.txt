In some mammals, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon (HAH) exposure causes wasting syndrome,
defined as significant weight loss associated with lethal outcomes. The most potent HAH in causing
wasting is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-r-dioxin (TCDD), which exerts its toxic effects through the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Since TCDD toxicity is thought to predominantly arise from dysregulation
of AHR-transcribed genes, it was hypothesized that wasting syndrome is a result of to TCDD-induced
dysregulation of genes involved in regulation of food-intake. As the hypothalamus is the central nervous
systems' regulatory center for food-intake and energy balance. Therefore, mRNA abundances in
hypothalamic tissue from two rat strains with widely differing sensitivities to TCDD-induced wasting
syndrome: TCDD-sensitive Long-Evans rats and TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar rats, 23 h after exposure to
TCDD (100mg/kg) or corn oil vehicle. TCDD exposure caused minimal transcriptional dysregulation in
the hypothalamus, with only 6 genes significantly altered in Long-Evans rats and 15 genes in Han/Wistar
rats. Two of the most dysregulated genes were Cyp1a1 and Nqo1, which are induced by TCDD across a
wide range of tissues and are considered sensitive markers of TCDD exposure. The minimal response of
the hypothalamic transcriptome to a lethal dose of TCDD at an early time-point suggests that the
hypothalamus is not the predominant site of initial events leading to hypophagia and associatedwasting.
TCDD may affect feeding behaviour via events upstream or downstream of the hypothalamus, and
further work is required to evaluate this at the level of individual hypothalamic nuclei and subregions.

1. Introduction
Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) are a class of
toxic compounds widely present within the environment as a
result of plastics incineration, electronics recycling, pesticide
application and paper bleaching (Linden et al., 2010; Okey 2007).

2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-r-dioxin (TCDD) is the best-studied
HAH, and exposure to it has been linked to teratogenesis,
immunosuppression, acute lethality and many other toxicities
(Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama 2003; Pohjanvirta and Tuomisto
1994). Perhaps most significantly in many mammalian models,
TCDD causes wasting syndrome-a potentially fatal 
dose-dependent reduction in body-weight (Linden et al., 2014; Seefeld
et al., 1984). Many laboratory animals exposed to TCDD experience
hypophagia and appear to defend a lowered body weight set point
(Linden et al., 2010; Seefeld et al., 1984). The role of wasting in
TCDD-induced lethality remains obscure: dietary interventions
such as force feeding and high-energy diets reduce or prevent
weight loss, but have minimal impact on mortality (Seefeld et al.,
1984; Tuomisto et al., 1999).
94
TCDD toxicity is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR), a ligand-responsive transcription factor involved in
regulation of cytochrome P450 proteins involved in the phase I
xenobiotic metabolism pathway (Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama
2003; Okey 2007). The AHR is a member of the PAS/basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) superfamily, with a bHLH domain and
two PAS domains within its N-terminus (Dolwick et al., 1993)
and a transactivation domain at its C-terminus (Ko et al., 1997).
In the absence of ligand, the AHR is cytoplasmic, where it
forms a complex with stabilizing chaperone proteins hsp90,
ARA9/XAP2 and p23 (Petrulis and Perdew 2002). Activation
occurs following ligand binding to the PAS-B domain, which
promotes translocation to the nucleus. The AHR then dimerizes
with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Reyes et al., 1992),
and this dimer binds to DNA and regulates transcription. Many
lines of evidence indicate that major toxicities from TCDD
are caused by dysregulation of AHR target genes (reviewed in
Okey 2007).
The hypothalamus is central to regulation of food intake and
energy balance, mainly through small peptide signalling
molecules. The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) translates
adipose level signals from peptides (insulin and leptin) to the rest
of the CNS by releasing neuropeptides and hormones (Konner
et al., 2009). Depending on the stimulus, these peptides may be
orexigenic (e.g. agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y
(NPY)) or anorexigenic (e.g. a-melanocortin-stimulating hormone
(a-MSH) and cocaine-and-amphetamine regulated transcript
(CART)). Lesions in hypothalamic nuclei that prevent normal
responses to signalling peptides can cause either hypophagia or
hyperphagia depending on lesion location (Elmquist et al., 1999;
Wang et al., 2013). As such, many groups have hypothesized that
TCDD-mediated changes in the hypothalamus underlie the
observed wasting syndrome. A previous study discovered a
non-additive interaction between ventromedial hypothalamic
lesions and TCDD on body weight, suggestive of the involvement
of a hypothalamic feed-intake regulation pathway in the wasting
syndrome (Tuomisto et al., 1995). TCDD has been previously
shown to modulate mRNA abundances of numerous 
neuropeptides and receptors, particularly orexigenic peptides, in both
directions (Linden et al., 2005). Additionally, several components
of the AHR-signalling pathway are expressed in the hypothalamus,
with three AHR-regulated genes (Ahrr, Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2)
significantly up-regulated in response to TCDD (Korkalainen
et al., 2005).
To evaluate the role of TCDD-induced transcriptomic changes in
the hypothalamus on observed toxicities, two rat strains that
markedly differ in susceptibility to TCDD-induced toxicities were
evaluated: TCDD-sensitive Long-Evans (Turku/AB) rats (L-E; LD50
20mg/kg for male rats) and TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar (Kuopio)
rats (H/W; LD50 >9600mg/kg) (Pohjanvirta et al., 1995; Unkila
et al., 1994). The great resistance of H/W rats to toxicity is due to a
pointmutation in the intron/exon boundary that causes alternative
splicing (Moffat et al., 2007; Pohjanvirta et al., 1998). This leads to
variation within the transactivation domain of AHR and alters
some responses to TCDD such as resisting lethality (Moffat et al.,
2007; Pohjanvirta et al., 1998). Wasting syndrome is another
example of this altered response; a mitigated variety of wasting
manifests in H/W rats but only after >100-fold higher doses of
TCDD than is required in L-E rats (Linden et al., 2010; Pohjanvirta
et al., 1998). The use of H/W rats allows for identification of
transcriptomic responses that differ from those in susceptible
strains (Boutros et al., 2011; Franc et al., 2008). Such differences
may identify the key genes whose dysregulation underlies
pathogenesis from TCDD exposure.

2. Methods
2.1. Samples
Sixteen male rats, eight L-E and eight H/W, were examined.
Rats were housed singly in stainless-steel wire-mesh cages and
subjected to light and dark cycles lasting 12h each, with lights on
from 07:00 to 19:00. Animals were fed pelleted R36 feed
(Lactamin, Södertälje, Sweden) and provided with tap water.
The temperature within the housing environment was 211 C
with relative humidity at 50%10%. H/W rats were 15-16 weeks
of age upon treatment while L-E rats were 16-22 weeks of age
(to compensate for the more rapid growth of H/W rats).
2.2. Animal handling
Four rats from each strainwere treated with 100mg/kg of TCDD
dissolved in corn oil vehicle while the remaining four were treated
only with corn oil which served as the vehicle control. Animals
were distributed such that each group was similarly body weight
matched prior to treatment. Treatments were administered by oral
gavage. Towards the end of the daily dark phase (between 5:40 and
6:45 a.m.), 23 h post exposure, all rats were euthanized by
decapitation. Hypothalamus (incision sites: rostral border of the
optic chiasm, caudal border of the mamillary body, ventral border
of the anterior commissure and lateral borders of the tuber
cinereum and mamillary body complexes) was rapidly removed
and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissueswere stored at80 C or
lower until processed. All study plans were approved by the
Animal Experiment Committee of the University of Kuopio and the
Provincial Government of Eastern Finland. All animal handling and
reporting comply with ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010).
2.3. Sample processing and microarray hybridization
Total mRNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue
Mini kits according to manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen,
Mississauga, Canada). Total RNA yield was quantified by UV
spectrophotometry and RNA integritywas verified using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA from
individual rats was hybridized to Affymetrix RAE230-2 arrays at
The Centre for Applied Genomics (Toronto, Canada) and RNA
abundances were quantified using an Affymetrix GeneChip
Scanner 3000.
2.4. Data preparation
Raw microarray data were loaded into the R statistical
environment (v3.1.0) using the affy package (v1.42.2) of the
BioConductor library and the EntrezGene ID map 
rat2302rnen-trezgcdf (v18.0.0) (Dai et al., 2005; Gautier et al., 2004). Raw data
were pre-processed using the RMA algorithm (Irizarry et al., 2003)
and quality-control plots were generated using the affy (v1.42.2),
lattice (v0.20-29) and latticeExtra (v0.6-26) packages to assess
sample homogeneity (Supplementary Fig. S1). Unsupervised
pattern recognition used the DIANA agglomerative hierarchical
clustering algorithm, as implemented in the cluster package
(v1.15.2) and Pearson's correlation was used as a similarity metric.
The distribution of the coefficient of variations for each gene
was analyzed to ensure low inter-replicate variance. All raw and
pre-processed microarray data are available in the GEO repository
(accession: GSE61039).

online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.12.016.
2.5. Statistical analysis
A linear model was fit to
relate TCDD treatment and vehicle controls for each rat strain
(i.e. HWT-HWC and LET-LEC). The variance amongst probes was
reduced using an empirical Bayes method (Smyth 2004).
Moderated t-tests compared each coefficient to zero, while
F-tests were applied gene-wise to test for significant differences
in variation between the two rat strains. All p-values were false
discovery-rate adjusted for multiple testing to generate q-values
(Storey and Tibshirani 2003). Linear modeling and hypothesis
testing were completed using the limma package (v3.20.4). Genes
were analyzed at multiple q-value thresholds to ensure results
were threshold-independent, but for primary analyses a threshold
q<0.05 was used.
2.6. Data visualization
Inter-strain p-value variability was quantified and plotted as
above. Inter-strain p-value variability plots compared the p-value

each gene using contrasts to

distribution between the two strains when mRNA abundance was
both up- and down-regulated. A Venn diagram, created using the
VennDiagram R package (v1.6.7), depicted the number of
significantly responsive genes in both rat strains at q<0.05 (Chen
and Boutros 2011). A heatmap gave a visual representation of the
change in gene expression, up- versus down-regulation, for the
most variable genes (variance >0.05 across all samples). Data was
mean centred and scaled using the standard deviation for each
variable and clustered as described above. Dotmaps were used to
depict the magnitude of change in log2-space (M) and significance
of TCDD-induced dysregulation for different subsets of genes.
Covariates were used to indicate significance of selected genes in
other tissues and species (rat liver (Yao et al., 2012) and in mouse
tissues (Boutros et al., 2009)).
2.7. Pathway analysis of TCDD-responsive genes
Functional pathways analysis was performedwith the GOMiner
software (v. 2011-01) (Zeeberg et al., 2003). Genes found to be
significantly responsive in either strain examined (q-value <0.1)
95
96
were analyzed against a list of all genes on the array. A 
false-discovery rate threshold of 0.1 was applied, with all look-up
options and gene ontologies selected and 1000 randomizations
used. A minimum category size of five was required to reduce
multiple-testing.
2.8. Transcription factor binding site analysis
To further explore the functionality of gene regulation by
TCDD in the hypothalamus, we examined each gene for the
AHR-associated conserved transcription-factor binding sites:
AHRE-I (core), AHRE-I (full) and AHRE-II. These sites contain the
sequences GCGTG, [T|G]NGCGTG[A|C][G|C]A and CATG{N6}C[T|A]
TG, respectively (Denison andWhitlock 1995; Sogawa et al., 2004).
Transcription start sites were determined using REFLINK and
REFFLAT tables fromUCSC genome browser, downloaded onMay9,
2012 (Karolchik et al., 2003). The number of each motif present in
each gene was counted and a PhyloHMM conservation score was
calculated, ranging from zero to one (Siepel and Haussler 2004).
This score measured conservation across species with a score a

K.E. Houlahan et al. / Toxicology 328 (2015) 93-101
zero reflecting minimal conservation and a score of one reflecting
complete conservation.
2.9. Validation
A subset of 50 transcripts including the AHR-core and candidate
genes (as identified above) was validated using the NanoString
system. Hypothalamic RNA (100ng)was shipped on dry ice to the
Princess Margaret Genomics Centre (Toronto, ON) for analysis. The
target gene list was submitted in advance and the required CodeSet
(multiplexed set of endogenous and control probes)was developed
by NanoString.
Raw data (RCC files consisting of direct molecule counts) were
received and normalization performed prior to analysis. Data were
read into the R statistical environment (v3.1.2) and normalization
performed using the NanoStringNorm package (v1.1.18)(Waggott
et al., 2012). Endogenous probes were normalized to the positive
control counts using the ‘sum’ method and to housekeeping genes
counts using the ‘housekeeping.geo.mean’ method in 
Nano-StringNorm. Housekeeping genes (Hprt1,Pgk1 and Sdha) had been
validated previously (Pohjanvirta et al., 2006) for use in
TCDD studies of rat hypothalamus. Similarly, this normalization
method had been previously identified as the most accurate (in
comparison to qPCR) for use in a similar study with rat hepatic
tissue (Prokopec et al., 2013). Normalized data was 
log2-transformed and linear modelling and visualizations performed
K.E. Houlahan et al. / Toxicology 328 (2015) 93-101
as above [R packages:
latticeExtra (v0.6-26)].
3. Results
3.1. Experimental design
Since the hypothalamus is associated with the regulation of
food intake and metabolism, the effects of TCDD exposure on the
hypothalamic transcriptome were analyzed. Two rat strains were
examined: TCDD-sensitive L/E rats and TCDD-resistant H/W rats.
Animals were treated with 100mg/kg TCDD or corn oil vehicle. In
L-E rats this dose of leads to an irreversible hypophagia and body
weight loss, with food intake plummeting from approximately
20g/day to 1-2 g/day. this rapid decrease in food intake occurred
within 5 days of TCDD exposure and thereafter persisted at that
level. In contrast in H/W rats, food intake diminishes from slightly
above 20 to about 10 g/day 6 days post-treatment, followed by a
rapid recovery to near control levels after 14 days (Lensu et al.,
2011a). In L-E rats, the reduction in food consumption reaches
statistical significance by 24-48h (Lensu et al., 2011a). Therefore,
hypothalamus tissue was isolated 23h post exposure to identify
primary transcriptional changes preceding hypophagia and body
weight loss. Moreover, tissues were collected near the end of the
darkness period because this phase coincides with one of the two
feeding peaks of L-E rats (Lensu et al., 2011b): we thus aimed to
optimize the probability of detecting critical alterations. In
contrast, at this time of day the circadian feeding rhythm of
H/W rats is approaching its nadir (Lensu et al., 2011b). The
experimental approach is summarized in Fig.1. Animals and arrays
used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.12.016.
3.2. Response to TCDD Exposure
Normalized microarray data demonstrated very similar mRNA
abundances, with hierarchical clustering recognizing greater
variability between rat strains than between samples treated with
TCDD or corn oil (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that in 
hypothalamus, unlike liver (Yao et al., 2012), inter-animal variability is larger
than the effects of TCDD exposure. Further, the distribution of
gene-wise coefficients of variation (CV= ratio of the 
standard-deviation to mean) shows a strong peak around 0.10 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2) for each treatment group. There was no evidence of
differential variance between the rat strains, with only 15/12,503
genes showing differences (F-test; q<0.05). Taken together, these
results demonstrate minimal transcriptomic differences between
replicates and minimal transcriptomic alterations as a result of
TCDD exposure.

online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.12.016.
A total of 12,503 individual genes were evaluated (Supplemen-
tary Table S2). Surprisingly, a larger number of genes were
dysregulated in TCDD-resistant H/W rats than in TCDD-sensitive
L-E rats, independent of statistical threshold applied (Fig. 2B). At a
standard threshold of q<0.05, we detected 15 genes dysregulated
by TCDD in H/W rats and 6 in L-E rats. Only 3 genes, Cyp1a1, Nqo1
and Stab1, were altered in both strains (Fig. 2C).

3.3. AHR-core gene responses
A set of nine genes that are altered by TCDD in an 
AHR-dependent fashion across a broad range of tissues, species, doses
and time-pointswere assembled (Boutros et al., 2008; Nebert et al.,
1993, 2000; Watson et al., 2014; Yeager et al., 2009). These genes
(Ahrr, Aldh3a1, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Fmo1, Inmt, Nfe2l2, Nqo1 and Tiparp)
provide a measure of the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to
transcriptional dysregulation by TCDD, as their effects in other
tissues have been well documented. Of these, Cyp1a1 was
significantly up-regulated in both species (3.9-fold in H/W and
3.6-fold in L-E), as was Nqo1, though to a lesser extent (0.8-fold in
H/W rats and 0.7-fold in L-E). The remaining genes did not show
TCDD-induced alteration, despite Cyp1a2 having previously shown
to be upregulated by TCDD in the hypothalamus (Korkalainen et al.,
2005). Note that hepatic studies in rats involving similar
conditions (100mg/kg of TCDD, 19h post-exposure) in both L-E
and H/W rats (Yao et al., 2012) demonstrated significantly more
TCDD-mediated changes in this subset of genes (Fig. 3A). Similarly,
murine studies of liver and kidney tissue following comparable
treatment conditions (1000mg/kg of TCDD, 19h) (Boutros et al.,
2009), showed considerably more TCDD-mediated transcriptional
changes (Fig. 3A).
3.4. Non-core gene responses
A subset of genes determined to be significantly altered by TCDD
ineither strainwas identifiedand furtherexamined.AHR-coregenes
were excluded from this subset, resulting in 16 genes. These genes
exhibited onlymoderatemagnitude dysregulation following 
TCDD-exposure (Fig. 3B). Stab1 showed the largest up-regulation amongst
non-core genes (1.0-fold induction in the H/W rat) while Ero1l
showed the greatest down-regulation (H/W, 0.7-fold change).
Intriguingly, none of the genes within this subset showed
transcriptional dysregulation by TCDD in rat liver, mouse liver or
mouse kidney (Boutros et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2012).
3.5. Validation of TCDD-responsive genes
A full validation experiment was performed using a NanoString
custom gene expression assay, including both AHR-core and
candidate genes. An increased response to TCDD for both strains
was observed across the AHR-core genes in the validation relative
to the microarray data (Fig. 4, top panel). Both Cyp1a1 and Nqo1
showed similar induction, however additional genes were also
determined as significantly differentially abundant, including
Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 in both strains and Aldh3a1 and Tiparp in only
H/W rats. Conversely, fewer candidate genes were determined to
be altered by TCDD in either strainwith only 20/32 cases validating
(Fig. 4, bottom panel). Of these, Stab1, LOC100361558, Ctgf,
Tmem63a, and Hspb9 could be validated in both strains.
3.6. Functional analysis and hypergeometric testing
Functional analysis of those genes showinga significant response
to TCDD was completed with the GOMiner software (Zeeberg et al.,
2003). No significantly enriched pathways were detected following
FDR correction (q<0.1; Supplementary Table S3). Hypergeometric
testingwas performed to determine if therewas chromosomal bias
represented in the significantly responsive genes (Supplementary
Table S4). No chromosomes were significantly enriched, indicating
no chromosomal bias for responses to TCDD in hypothalamus.

3.7. Transcription factor binding site analysis
AHR conserved transcription factor binding sitemotifsmay give
further mechanistic insight into the AHR-regulation of genes
(Denison and Whitlock 1995; Sogawa et al., 2004). Violin plots
(Supplementary Fig. S3) show the occurrence and maximal
conservation score of each motif against the number of strains
inwhich the genewas found to be significantly responsive toTCDD
exposure (AHRE-I (core), AHRE-I (full) and AHRE-II). AHRE-I (core)
was found to occur more often and with higher conservation in
genes significantly responsive in both rat strains (i.e. Cyp1a1 and
Nqo1). By contrast, AHRE-II was not enriched at either the level of
conservation or frequency.

4. Discussion
The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) plays a pivotal role in
the regulation of energy balance (Linden et al., 2010). The ARC
responds to insulin and leptin signals originating from the
periphery and acts via production and release of orexigenic or
anorexigenic neuropeptides and hormones and therefore could
play an important role inwasting syndrome. Previous studies have
indicated that the hypothalamus plays a role in cachexia (Ihnatko
et al., 2013) and hypothalamic injury can lead to hyperplasia
(Elmquist et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2013). To better understand the
role the hypothalamus may play in TCDD-induced wasting
syndrome, we analyzed transcriptomic changes occurring in the
hypothalamus following TCDD exposure.
mRNA abundance for two of the AHR-core genes, Cyp1a1 and
Nqo1, displayed significantly increased abundance following
treatment with TCDD. While the magnitude of Cyp1a1 induction
was dramatically lower than that observed in hepatic tissue of
similarly treated rats (Yao et al., 2012), levels reached similar
abundances as those observed previously in the hypothalamus
(Korkalainen et al., 2005). The reduced magnitude of induction of
Nqo1 in hypothalamus relative to liver following TCDD exposure
(as observed by both microarray and NanoString) is an interesting
finding that has not been reported previously. Alternatively, the
absence of significant Cyp1a2 induction following treatment may
be an artifact of the array technology as significant induction
resembling that observed previously (Korkalainen et al., 2005) was
validated by NanoString in these samples.
With the exception of Cyp1a1, altered genes exhibited only
modest changes in abundance in response to TCDD, with changes
of less than two-fold relative to control animals. This low
magnitude of change in candidate genes was similarly observed
by NanoString validation. The relatively few alterations to the
transcriptome, combined with the small magnitude of these
changesmay suggest that the hypothalamus is largely refractory to
direct local effects of TCDD. However, the specific genes showing
significant alterations may still shed evidence on downstream
toxicities. A group of 3 genes were significantly altered only in L-E
rats and may therefore be involved in the sensitive phenotype.
MSRB1 is involved in the protein repair mechanism during
oxidative stress (Lee et al., 2009) and has been shown to regulate
assembly of actin filaments relating to macrophage activity
(Lee et al., 2013). Increased abundance of this mRNA may indicate
a potential defense mechanism against TCDD-induced reactive
oxygen species. Alternatively, decreased mRNA abundances of
Wdpcp and Clec4a may have etiological roles in TCDD-induced
toxicity. Wdpcp is required for the stabilization of actin filaments
and development of cell polarity (Cui et al., 2013) while Clec4a
(DCIR) is typically expressed in immune tissues (Bates et al., 1999)
and is involved in the immune response.
Of the 11 genes uniquely altered in H/W rats, nine were 
up-regulated by TCDD while the remaining three were 
down-regulated. Ctgf has been validated as an AHR-target gene coding
for CTGF, a regulatory protein that mediates cell division and
apoptosis and has been documented to promote tumour growth

and progression (Chu et al., 2008; Faust et al., 2013). It also plays an
important role in mediating cell adhesion and migration primarily
in activation of rat oval cells (Pi et al., 2008). Sod3 has been shown
to act as a tumour suppressor in prostate (Kim et al., 2014) and
pancreatic cancer (Sibenaller et al., 2014) by modulation of ROS.
Alternatively, induction of Ero1l by HIF-1a within a hypoxic
microenvironment leads to angiogenesis and improved tumour
survival (May et al., 2005). Within the resistant H/W strain, these
findings (overexpression of Sod3 and reduced expression of Ero1l)
align with the reduced carcinogenic effects of TCDD. Traf4 is a
common oncogene (Camilleri-Broet et al., 2007), however
overexpression has also been shown to be essential for
homeostasis of CNS myelination (Blaise et al., 2012).
Two genes, Stab1 and Acvrl1, were overexpressed in both H/W
and L-E rats. STAB1 is a scavenger receptor expressed by
macrophages and may aid in phagocytic and anti-inflammatory
processes (Park et al., 2009). ACVRL1 is a type 1 receptor for 
TGF-beta proteins and is required for angiogenesis (Oh et al., 2000).
Increased mRNA abundance of these genes may represent a
common adaptive response to TCDD-induced damages.
Previous studies comparing mRNA abundance changes 
following TCDD treatment have shown L-E rats have significantly higher
numbers of genes dysregulated by TCDD, as compared to H/W rat
(Franc et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2012). However, the hypothalamus of
H/W rats had more altered transcripts than in L-E rats. Given that
all animals fromboth rat strains had reached sexualmaturity at the
time of TCDD exposure, it is not likely that the difference in age
affected the transcriptomic response. Similarly, animals 
experienced identical environmental and handling conditions. Although
the magnitude of Cyp1a1 induction is low in hypothalamus when
compared with liver, the observed induction in both L-E and H/W
rats indicates that TCDD does in fact reach and effectively activate
theAHR in the hypothalamus of both strains, in accordance with
previous work (Pohjanvirta et al., 1990). It is important to note that
our study was designed to emphasize detection of early 
transcriptomic responses during the time when the onset of
measurable feeding responses occurs in TCDD-treated rats.
A study conducted by Linden et al. (2005) on the effect of TCDD
exposure on neuropeptide concentrations further supports our
results as it showed that TCDD alters anorexigenic and orexigenic
neuropeptides but not consistently (Linden et al., 2005). Attention
has now turned to nitric oxide and its combined effects with
orexigenic peptides, ghrelin, NPY and orexin-A, in food intake
regulation. An alteration in nitric oxide concentration may
indirectly affect this regulatory pathway, although results of these
studies have not been conclusive (Linden et al., 2010). 
Ventromedial hypothalamic lesions aggravate TCDD-induced weight loss
and, therefore, indicate that TCDD implements toxic effects at
some point along the hypothalamic pathways regulating energy
homeostasis (Tuomisto et al., 1995). The minimal impact of TCDD
on hypothalamic transcriptomic responses in hypothalamus seen
in this study, along with studies on TCDD response of mRNAs for
hypothalamic neuropeptides and bHLS/PAS proteins, suggest that
hypothalamic changes alone are not responsible for TCDD-induced
hypophagia (Korkalainen et al., 2005; Linden et al., 2005). Analysis
of the entire hypothalamic tissue blockmaymask strictly localized
alterations in functionally-specific nuclei.
The hypothalamus is a highly compartmentalized structure
consisting of clusters of functionally specialized cells (Schindler
et al., 2012), each type of which could have diverse responses to
TCDD. The tissue samples we analyzed are derived from the whole
hypothalamus. An in depth analysis of specialized cell types might
provide more enlightening results. Alternatively, the 
hypothalamus may be indirectly involved in wasting-syndrome-associated
hypophagia as TCDD may directly affect other feed-intake
regulatory organs. Analysis of alternate nervous system 
components in this regulatory pathway (i.e. caudal brainstem and
medullary area postrema) as well as factors upstream or
downstream (i.e. adipose tissue) may provide more insight into
the mechanisms underlying toxic effects of TCDD, as they pertain
to wasting syndrome.

Fig. 1. Experimental design. 
Han/Wistar (H/W) and Long-Evans (L-E) rats were evaluated 23h after treatment with either 100mg/kg of TCDD (T) or corn oil vehicle (CO). mRNA abundances were 
measured on Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays and RMA-normalized prior to downstream analysis. 

Fig. 2. Strain variability. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 
(A) Transcriptomic expression profiles of a subset of genes with the greatest variance (variance >0.05) across the study were subjected to DIANA agglomerative hierarchical 
clustering. Covariates specify either rat strain (H/W and L-E; green and purple, respectively) or treatment status (TCDD or corn oil control; red or white, respectively). 
Clustering indicates greater variability in expression profiles between rat strains than between treatment groups. (B) An analysis of the number of genes significantly altered 
by TCDD at various q-value thresholds demonstrate a minimal number of significantly altered genes in either strain (both up- and down-regulated). (C) Overlap of 
significantly altered geneswith a 0.05 q-value threshold. Three geneswere significantly altered in only L-E ratswhile 12 genes showed significantly altered expression in only 
H/W rats. Three genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in both rat strains. 

Fig. 3. Gene response to TCDD exposure. (For interpretation of the references to 
colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 
(A) Nine geneswithin the AHR-core geneswere analyzed for their response toTCDD 
in hypothalamus. The size of the dot depicts the magnitude of the change (log2 fold 
change) while colour depicts the direction of change - up (red) or down (blue). 
Background shading reflects the q-value. Covariates convey whether the gene is 
significantly expressed in H/W or L-E liver and C57BL/6 mouse kidney or liver. (B) 
16 genes outside of the AHR-core were significantly altered by TCDD either H/W 
(n =15) and/or L-E (n =6). The figure shows the log2 fold-change values with their 
corresponding q-value and covariates as described in Fig. 3A. None of these genes 
were significantly altered in H/W rat liver, L-E rat liver, mouse liver, or mouse 
kidney. 

Fig. 4. Validation of candidate genes. (For interpretation of the references to colour 
in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 
Validation was performed on 9 AHR-core genes and 16 candidate genes. The size of 
the dot depicts the magnitude of the change (log2 fold change) while colour depicts 
the direction of change - up (red) or down (blue). Background shading reflects the 
q-value.
