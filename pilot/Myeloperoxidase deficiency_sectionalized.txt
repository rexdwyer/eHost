>>>section: methods
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Hematoxylin and eosin stains and NM (mechlorethamine hydrochloride; purity, 98%) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO). Paraffin wax for tissue block
preparation was obtained from Triangle Biomedical Sciences (Durham, NC). DeadEnd™
Colorimetric TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling) system was purchased from
Promega (Madison, WI) and Fluoro MPO™ Fluorescent MPO Detection Kit was obtained
from Cell Technology (Mountain View, CA). Primary antibodies for H2A.X and MMP-9,
COX-2, and iNOS were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA), Cayman
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. We used β
actin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
2.2 Animal exposure with NM
Male C57BL/6J wild type (hereafter refereed as WT mice) and B6.129X1-Mpotm1Lus/J
mice, homozygous null for MPO gene where no MPO gene product is detected (hereafter
refereed as MPO KO mice), were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).
Before starting the experiments, mice were acclimatized for one week under standard
housing and feeding conditions and all experiments were performed according to approved
IACUC protocols of the University of Colorado Denver, CO (Protocol No - 57912(08)1E).
Prior to NM exposure, mice were shaved using clippers to remove hair from their dorsal
skin. Both wild type and MPO KO mice (n=3) were exposed with 6 mg NM in 200 μL of
acetone/mouse applied topically to the dorsal shaved skin. Mice were 5-6 weeks of age with
mean weight of 25g at the start of the experiment. Acetone (200 μL) alone was applied as
vehicle control for NM and another group of mice were kept without any exposure, and used
as untreated control. All the results following NM exposure were compared with vehicle
control group and each study group consisted of three mice. Since MPO plays an important
role in SM-induced skin injury and inflammation, we employed a high dose of NM to assess
the effect of MPO deletion on skin injuries in both MPO KO and WT mice. Skin bi-fold
thickness was measured at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure using digital calipers as reported
earlier (Tewari-Singh et al. 2009). Immediately following measurement, at 12 h and 24 h
post-exposure, mice were euthanized, dorsal skin collected and skin punches fixed for
histology and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. The rest of the skin tissue was snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular studies.
Page 3
Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Though some studies have examined the role of neutrophils in
injury with SM (Ham et al., 2012; Levitt et al., 2003; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Vavra et al.,
2004), little is known about the mechanism and role of neutrophil-derived MPO-mediated
inflammation and injury in vesicant-exposed skin tissue. Accordingly, the current study was
designed to evaluate the role of neutrophil derived MPO in NM-induced skin injury by
utilizing C57BL/6J wild type and MPO knockout (B6.129X1-Mpotm1Lus/J) mice. Our
results showed an attenuation of NM-induced skin injury biomarkers in MPO KO mice,
indicating an important role of neutrophil-derived MPO in vesicant-induced skin injury and
inflammation.

2.3 Histopathological analysis
Page 4
2.4 TUNEL assay
Skin tissues were fixed O/N in 10% (v/v) phosphate buffered formalin and dehydrated in
ascending concentrations of ethanol, cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin. 5μm
thick skin sections were processed for H&E staining as reported earlier (Jain et al., 2011b;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). H&E slides were microscopically evaluated for measurement of
epidermal thickness, neutrophil infiltration, dermal injury and the incidences of
microvesication as reported earlier (Jain et al., 2011b).
Apoptotic cell death was detected using DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL assay according to
the vendor’s protocol as detailed earlier (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). At
the end of the assay, TUNEL positive cells (brown colored) were quantified in 15 randomly
selected fields using 400 magnification. Apoptotic cell index (% apoptotic cell death) was
calculated as the number of apoptotic cells × 100 divided by total number of cells.
2.5 Immunohistochemical staining
Phospho-H2A.X ser139 (a marker of DNA damage) was analyzed by IHC as described
previously (Jain et al., 2011a). Briefly, paraffin embedded skin sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and treated for antigen retrieval by heat treatment in sodium citrate buffer
(pH-6). The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked and sections were incubated with
rabbit polyclonal phospho-H2A.X ser139 antibody (1:100) O/N in humidified chamber.
After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with appropriate biotin conjugated
secondary antibody and then with streptavidin-HRP conjugates. Following another wash
step, sections were incubated with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) for immunopositivity
reaction and color development. Thereafter, slides were mounted for microscopic
observation. After IHC staining, cells in the skin epidermis were counted in 15 randomly
selected fields using 400 magnification and the percent of phospho-H2A.X ser139 positive
cells were quantified according to the method described above. All the H&E and IHC
stained slides were observed using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.,
Germany) and image analysis and representative pictures were taken by using Carl Zeiss
Axiovision Rel 4.5 software.
2.6 MPO activity assay
MPO activity was measured in skin tissue samples through use of the Fluorescent
Myeloperoxidase Detection Kit from Cell Technology as reported earlier (Tewari-Singh et
al. 2009). In brief, approximately 100 mg tissue samples were homogenized in
homogenization buffer (provided in kit) and isolated protein was measured by Lowry’s
method (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A 50 μg of
protein/tissue sample was used to determine MPO activity from three separate animals as
described previously (Jain et al., 2011b). MPO activity was expressed as mU/μg of protein
using MPO standard curve.

2.7 Western Blot analysis
Page 5
2.8 Statistical analysis
Statistically significant differences between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA
using SigmaStat 3.5 software (Jandel scientific, San Rafael, CA) and the Tukey test for
multiple comparisons, with p-value of < 0.05 considered as significant. Data is represented
in ± SEM from three replicate animals.

Abstract
The pathologic mechanisms of skin injuries, following the acute inflammatory response induced
by vesicating agents sulfur mustard (SM) and nitrogen mustard (NM) exposure, are poorly
understood. Neutrophils which accumulate at the site of injury, abundantly express
myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein that is implicated in oxidant-related antimicrobial and
cytotoxic responses. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to SM analog 2-chloroethyl
ethyl sulfide (CEES) or NM results in an inflammatory response including increased neutrophilic
infiltration and MPO activity. To further define the role of neutrophil-derived MPO in 
NM-induced skin injury, here we used a genetic approach and examined the effect of NM exposure (12
h and 24 h) on previously established injury endpoints in C57BL/6J wild type (WT) and
B6.129X1-MPOtm1Lus/J mice (MPO KO), homozygous null for MPO gene. NM exposure
caused a significant increase in skin bi-fold thickness, epidermal thickness, microvesication, DNA
damage and apoptosis in WT mice compared to MPO KO mice. MPO KO mice showed relatively
insignificant effect. Similarly, NM-induced increases in the expression of inflammatory and
proteolytic mediators, including COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 in WT mice, while having a
significantly lower effect in MPO KO mice. Collectively, these results show that MPO, which
generates microbicidal oxidants, plays an important role in NM-induced skin injuries. This
suggests the development of mechanism-based treatments against NM- and SM-induced skin
injuries that inhibit MPO activity and attenuate MPO-derived oxidants.

Sulfur mustard; nitrogen mustard; myeloperoxidase; inflammation; apoptosis; DNA damage
Sulfur mustard [SM; bis (2-chloroethyl) sulfide] and nitrogen mustard (NM;
mechlorethamine) are primary vesicating agents, which pose potential threat for use in
chemical warfare and terrorist attack (Saladi et al., 2006; Sharma et al., 2010; Smith et al.,
1995). Both of these mustard agents are highly toxic bifunctional alkylating agents, which
upon exposure cause severe skin injury including inflammation and disruption of 
epidermal-dermal layers leading to vesication (Graham et al., 2005; Hayden et al., 2009; Jain et al.,
2011b; Joseph et al., 2011; Laskin et al., 2010; McManus and Huebner, 2005). In the past
few years, numerous studies have been carried out to explore the mechanisms of cell death,
inflammation and vesication caused by warfare and alkylating agent SM exposure (Casillas
et al., 2000; Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2011b; Kehe et al., 2009; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005;
Pal et al., 2009; Rice, 2003; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). However,
further investigations are needed to define the mechanism of skin injury and healing
processes after vesicant exposure, especially pathogenesis involving the inflammatory
response where infiltration of polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMNs) is reported to play
an important role (Dacre and Goldman, 1996; Graham et al., 2005; Millard et al., 1997;
Wormser, 1991).
SM-induced PMN infiltration, mainly neutrophils, has been shown as an early event
occurring within 30 min and peaking at 6-12 h post-exposure in human skin (Lindsay and
Rice, 1996; Millard et al., 1997; Wormser et al., 2005). Neutrophil infiltration plays a key
role in host defense. However, its excessive stimulation induces the release of cytokines and
growth factors which contribute to the healing process (Segal, 2005; Weiss, 1989).
Conversely, neutrophils and to some extent monocytes and macrophages, secrete
myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO is a member of heme peroxidase-cyclooxygenase family, at
the site of tissue injury generating powerful oxidants, free radicals and hypochlorous acid,
which can cause tissue injury (Brennan et al., 2001; Klebanoff, 2005; Shiba et al., 2008).
Infiltration of neutrophils also plays an important role in blister formation by secreting a
variety of proteolytic enzymes including collagenase, gelatinase and elastase. These
enzymesare able to degrade specific elements in the extracellular matrix leading to
epidermal-dermal separation as observed in skin diseases like psoriasis (Glinski et al., 1990)
and bullous pemphigoid (Liu et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2000). SM-induced biochemical
changes include high MPO activity, free radical generation and cytokine production (Ham et
al., 2012). Our previous studies with SM analog 2, chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) and NM
have shown an increase in neutrophil infiltration and MPO (a marker indicating neutrophil
infiltration) activity in mouse skin (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). We have
also shown that both CEES and NM exposure induces DNA damage, cell death, oxidative
stress, microvesication, activation of proteolytic and inflammatory mediators as well as
related signaling pathways. These previous studies indicated that neutrophil-derived MPO
could play a vital role in vesicant-induced skin lesions (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009;

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Hematoxylin and eosin stains and NM (mechlorethamine hydrochloride; purity, 98%) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO). Paraffin wax for tissue block
preparation was obtained from Triangle Biomedical Sciences (Durham, NC). DeadEnd™
Colorimetric TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling) system was purchased from
Promega (Madison, WI) and Fluoro MPO™ Fluorescent MPO Detection Kit was obtained
from Cell Technology (Mountain View, CA). Primary antibodies for H2A.X and MMP-9,
COX-2, and iNOS were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA), Cayman
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. We used β
actin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
2.2 Animal exposure with NM
Male C57BL/6J wild type (hereafter refereed as WT mice) and B6.129X1-Mpotm1Lus/J
mice, homozygous null for MPO gene where no MPO gene product is detected (hereafter
refereed as MPO KO mice), were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).
Before starting the experiments, mice were acclimatized for one week under standard
housing and feeding conditions and all experiments were performed according to approved
IACUC protocols of the University of Colorado Denver, CO (Protocol No - 57912(08)1E).
Prior to NM exposure, mice were shaved using clippers to remove hair from their dorsal
skin. Both wild type and MPO KO mice (n=3) were exposed with 6 mg NM in 200 μL of
acetone/mouse applied topically to the dorsal shaved skin. Mice were 5-6 weeks of age with
mean weight of 25g at the start of the experiment. Acetone (200 μL) alone was applied as
vehicle control for NM and another group of mice were kept without any exposure, and used
as untreated control. All the results following NM exposure were compared with vehicle
control group and each study group consisted of three mice. Since MPO plays an important
role in SM-induced skin injury and inflammation, we employed a high dose of NM to assess
the effect of MPO deletion on skin injuries in both MPO KO and WT mice. Skin bi-fold
thickness was measured at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure using digital calipers as reported
earlier (Tewari-Singh et al. 2009). Immediately following measurement, at 12 h and 24 h
post-exposure, mice were euthanized, dorsal skin collected and skin punches fixed for
histology and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. The rest of the skin tissue was snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular studies.

Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Though some studies have examined the role of neutrophils in
injury with SM (Ham et al., 2012; Levitt et al., 2003; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Vavra et al.,
2004), little is known about the mechanism and role of neutrophil-derived MPO-mediated
inflammation and injury in vesicant-exposed skin tissue. Accordingly, the current study was
designed to evaluate the role of neutrophil derived MPO in NM-induced skin injury by
utilizing C57BL/6J wild type and MPO knockout (B6.129X1-Mpotm1Lus/J) mice. Our
results showed an attenuation of NM-induced skin injury biomarkers in MPO KO mice,
indicating an important role of neutrophil-derived MPO in vesicant-induced skin injury and
inflammation.

2.3 Histopathological analysis
Page 4
2.4 TUNEL assay
Skin tissues were fixed O/N in 10% (v/v) phosphate buffered formalin and dehydrated in
ascending concentrations of ethanol, cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin. 5μm
thick skin sections were processed for H&E staining as reported earlier (Jain et al., 2011b;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). H&E slides were microscopically evaluated for measurement of
epidermal thickness, neutrophil infiltration, dermal injury and the incidences of
microvesication as reported earlier (Jain et al., 2011b).
Apoptotic cell death was detected using DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL assay according to
the vendor’s protocol as detailed earlier (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). At
the end of the assay, TUNEL positive cells (brown colored) were quantified in 15 randomly
selected fields using 400 magnification. Apoptotic cell index (% apoptotic cell death) was
calculated as the number of apoptotic cells × 100 divided by total number of cells.
2.5 Immunohistochemical staining
Phospho-H2A.X ser139 (a marker of DNA damage) was analyzed by IHC as described
previously (Jain et al., 2011a). Briefly, paraffin embedded skin sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and treated for antigen retrieval by heat treatment in sodium citrate buffer
(pH-6). The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked and sections were incubated with
rabbit polyclonal phospho-H2A.X ser139 antibody (1:100) O/N in humidified chamber.
After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with appropriate biotin conjugated
secondary antibody and then with streptavidin-HRP conjugates. Following another wash
step, sections were incubated with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) for immunopositivity
reaction and color development. Thereafter, slides were mounted for microscopic
observation. After IHC staining, cells in the skin epidermis were counted in 15 randomly
selected fields using 400 magnification and the percent of phospho-H2A.X ser139 positive
cells were quantified according to the method described above. All the H&E and IHC
stained slides were observed using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.,
Germany) and image analysis and representative pictures were taken by using Carl Zeiss
Axiovision Rel 4.5 software.
2.6 MPO activity assay
MPO activity was measured in skin tissue samples through use of the Fluorescent
Myeloperoxidase Detection Kit from Cell Technology as reported earlier (Tewari-Singh et
al. 2009). In brief, approximately 100 mg tissue samples were homogenized in
homogenization buffer (provided in kit) and isolated protein was measured by Lowry’s
method (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A 50 μg of
protein/tissue sample was used to determine MPO activity from three separate animals as
described previously (Jain et al., 2011b). MPO activity was expressed as mU/μg of protein
using MPO standard curve.

2.7 Western Blot analysis
Page 5
2.8 Statistical analysis
Statistically significant differences between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA
using SigmaStat 3.5 software (Jandel scientific, San Rafael, CA) and the Tukey test for
multiple comparisons, with p-value of < 0.05 considered as significant. Data is represented
in ± SEM from three replicate animals.
3. Results
3.1 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced tissue MPO activity
Our previous studies in mice have shown a profound increase in neutrophil infiltration and
MPO activity in skin after dorsal exposure with CEES and NM at 12 h and 24 h time points
(Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). To further investigate the
role of the neutrophil-derived MPO enzyme in NM-induced skin injury, we employed a
genetic approach using MPO KO mice where neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity were
determined following NM exposure. H&E staining of the skin tissue sections from wild type
and MPO KO mice 12 h and 24 h after NM exposure showed high neutrophil infiltration and
dermal edema in NM-exposed wild type mice as compared with an untreated control (Fig.
1A). However, the NM-induced increase in neutrophil infiltration or edema was not evident
in MPO KO mice (Fig. 1C). To confirm the absence of MPO activity and the markedly
diminished neutrophil infiltration in MPO KO mice, MPO activity was measured in wild
type and MPO KO mice (Fig. 1B and D). In comparison with control wild type mice where
MPO activity was 2.4 mU/μg protein, high MPO activity was observed after 12 h (16.3
mU/μg protein) of NM exposure. This was maximal at 24 h (116.9 mU/μg protein) 
post-exposure (Fig. 1B). Conversely, very low MPO activity was observed in MPO KO mice at
12 h (2.14 mU/μg protein) and 24 h (1.40 mU/μg protein) post-NM exposure, which was
comparable to MPO activity in control mice (1.48 mU/μg protein; Fig. 1D).
3.2 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced skin bi-fold thickness and epidermal
thickness increases
Our previous studies have shown that CEES and NM caused an increase in skin bi-fold
thickness and epidermal thickness in mice (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2013;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). To examine whether similar effects were present in NM-treated
COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 were detected in frozen skin tissue samples by Western blotting.
Approximately 100 mg of tissue was taken from the skin samples and homogenized in lysis
buffer as published earlier (Jain et al., 2011a) and protein content was measured using
Lowry’s method (Lowry et al., 1951). For western blotting, 50 μg of protein from three
animals per group was subjected to SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane by western blotting. After blocking, membranes were probed with
primary antibodies against COX-2 (1:500), iNOS (1:500), and MMP-9 (1:500) for overnight
at 4°C, followed by peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. Protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). In each case, protein loading was
monitored by stripping and re-probing the blots with β-actin.

MPO KO mice, we first measured the skin bi-fold thickness at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure.
In WT mice, NM caused a significant (p<0.05) increase in skin bi-fold thickness after 24 h
(1.46 fold) in comparison with the untreated control. On the other hand, a significant
increase in bi-fold thickness was not observed in MPO KO mice at 12 h (1.3 fold) or 24 h
(1.04 fold) post-NM exposure in comparison with control (Fig. 2A). H&E stained tissue
sections from both types of mice were next analyzed for epidermal thickness at 12 h and 24
h after NM exposure. In wild type mice, NM caused a significant (P<0.05) 2.2-fold increase
in epidermal thickness at 12 h following exposure (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, there was no
significant effect of NM on epidermal thickness in MPO KO mice at 12 h or 24 h 
post-exposure (Fig. 2E).
3.3 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced microvesication
Our previous studies have reported that CEES and NM cause microvesication in mice, and
established this lesion as an important biomarker of vesicant skin injury (Jain et al., 2011b;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2013; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). Similar to our previous reports,
microvesication (epidermal-dermal separation) was observed 12 h and 24 h post-NM
exposure in WT mice. However, these events were reduced in MPO KO mice (Fig. 3A and
C). The incidence of microvesication was quantified according to their size; small
(<100μm2), medium (100-500 μm2) and large (>500 μm2) per skin section of mice. In WT
mice, small NM-induced lesions of microvesication were 5.0 ± 0.70 at 12 h and 4.05 ± 0.65
at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 3B). NM-induced lesions of medium and large sized
microvesicles gradually increased and were maximal at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 3A and B)
In MPO KO mice, lesser incidences of all sizes of microvesication lesions were observed in
comparison with WT mice at both 12 h and 24 h post-NM exposure (Fig. 3 C and D).
Maximal occurrence of small sized NM-induced lesions of microvesication in WT mice,
were 2.5 ± 0.71 and 3.15 ± 0.70 at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure, respectively, in MPO KO
mice (Fig. 3D).
3.4 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced DNA damage and apoptotic cell death
Phospho-H2A.X Ser139 is a marker of DNA damage (Rogakou et al., 1998), that is shown
to increase following vesicant exposure indicating DNA damage (Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et
al., 2011a; Joseph et al., 2011; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Previously, our studies have
shown that CEES or NM exposure causes DNA damage leading to cell death of skin
keratinocytes, and this could be a major contributor of skin injury (Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et
al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Since MPO takes part in the
production of free radicals which may cause DNA damage and apoptotic cell death, we
examined the hypothesis that ablation of PMN and MPO activity would decrease the DNA
damage and cell death following NM treatment. In WT mice, NM exposure resulted in a
significant (p<0.05) increase in the number of phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells (Fig.
4A). After 12 h and 24 h of NM exposure in WT mice, 48.2 ± 3.5% and 47.6 ± 1.4% H2A.X
Ser139 positive cells, respectively, were observed in NM-exposed mice compared with only
20 ± 1.0% phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells in control mice skin (Fig. 4B). In skin
tissue from MPO KO mice, 33 ± 4.8% and 37 ± 1.3% phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells
were observed at 12 h and 24 h post-NM exposure compared with 18 ± 8.2% positive cells
in control. However, this increase was not significant (Fig. 4C and D). Apoptotic cell death,

which is one of the early responses in NM-induced skin injury, was analyzed by TUNEL
staining. Quantification of data from TUNEL-stained skin sections from WT mice showed a
significantly (P<0.05) increased percent of apoptotic cell death at 12 h (49 ± 2.5%) and 24 h
(42 ± 0.68%) after NM exposure in comparison with the untreated control (26.%; Fig. 4E
and F). However, in skin tissues from MPO KO mice, no significant increase in apoptotic
cell death was observed at 12 h (19 ± 3.4%) and 24 h (25 ± 2.2%) after NM exposure, again
when compared with control (16 ± 6.8%; Fig. 4G and H).
3.5 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 levels
It has been previously reported that COX-2 and iNOS play important roles in SM and 
SM-analog induced skin injury and inflammation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009). Therefore,
levels of COX-2 and iNOS were quantitated by western blotting following NM exposure.
These blots clearly showed an NM-induced increase in expression of COX-2 at 12 h (18.3
fold) and 24 h (15.9 fold) post-exposure; this increase was completely attenuated in MPO
KO mice (Fig. 5A). Similarly, NM exposure also caused an increase in iNOS levels at 12 h
(5.3 fold) and 24 h (7.3 fold) post-NM exposure, when compared to control skin tissue in
WT mice (Fig. 5 A). In MPO KO mice, NM-exposure failed to increase the quantity of
iNOS at 12 h post-exposure. However, at 24 h post-exposure NM induced an increase in
iNOS in the MPO KO mice albeit less than that observed in WT mice (Fig. 5A).
As described above, NM exposure caused an increased number of microvesication lesions in
WT mice when compared to MPO KO mice. MMP-9 levels are reported to increase after
vesicant exposure and this plays a role in microvesication because it can degrade the
components of extracellular matrix and basement membrane allowing epidermal dermal
separation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Shakarjian et al., 2010). To elucidate the role
of the MPO enzyme in microvesication, MMP-9 expression was measured at 12 h and 24 h
following NM exposure in both WT and MPO KO mice (Fig. 5B). NM exposure caused an
increase in MMP-9 levels at 12 h (26 fold) and 24 h (10.2 fold) post-exposure in WT mice.
However, in MPO KO mice, NM exposure induced only a slight increase in MMP-9 levels
at both 12 h (3.3 fold) and 24 h (4.4 fold) post-exposure (Fig. 5 B).
4. Discussion
Although substantial research efforts have focused on understanding the mechanisms of skin
injuries from SM exposure, process causing cutaneous lesions via acute inflammatory
response after SM exposure is poorly understood. Earlier studies have shown that PMNs,
mainly neutrophils, accumulate at the site of injury after SM exposure (Joseph et al., 2011;
Shakarjian et al., 2010; Vavra et al., 2004). Similarly, our studies following exposure to SM
analogs CEES and NM have also shown infiltration of inflammatory cells including
neutrophils with greatly elevated MPO activity in mouse skin (Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et al.,
2011a; Jain et al., 2011b; Pal et al., 2009; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). Vesicant-induced
neutrophil infiltration elicits MPO enzyme secretion which could enhance oxidative stress
and inflammation in skin, and this plays an important role in resulting skin injuries.
Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of neutrophil derived MPO enzyme
in the inflammation-related mechanism of NM-induced skin injuries. Our results from this
study using MPO KO mice demonstrate for the first time that MPO plays an important role

in NM-induced skin injury by attenuating DNA damage, cell death, vesication and
inflammation.
Due to limited access to SM, we used NM in this study because both SM and NM are
vesicating and powerful alkylating and vesicating agents that show toxic effects following
cutaneous exposure (Smith et al., 1998; Tewari-Singh et al., 2013; Wormser et al., 2002).
We employed established NM-induced endpoints from our previous studies (Inturi et al.,
2013 and unpublished data) in this study in C57BL/6J mice, since MPO KO mice were
produced on a C57BL/6 background.
Both SM- and NM-induced skin injuries occur mainly due to their alkylating properties and
direct DNA damage (Inturi et al., 2011; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005; Walker, 1971). However,
generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS or RNS) after SM and NM exposure
also have been shown to cause DNA damage leading to injuries (Kehe et al., 2009; Laskin et
al., 2010; Naghii, 2002; Shakarjian et al., 2010). These injuries occur largely due to the
sensitivity of the basal epidermal keratinocytes to SM where DNA damage is a major
element (Dacre and Goldman, 1996; Graham et al., 2005; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005;
Papirmeister et al., 1985). The Inflammatory response is considered to play a vital role in
SM-induced pathology; neutrophil infiltration is a major early event in the inflammatory
response (Lindsay and Rice, 1996; Millard et al., 1997). The neutrophil infiltration could
contribute to oxidative stress and DNA damage, and could cause secondary injuries and
inflammation. This may be attributed to the secretion of MPO by azurophilic granules of
activated neutrophils at the site of inflammation which oxidizes Cl− to hypoclorus acid
(HOCl), a reactive oxidant, and causes indirect DNA damage (El Kebir et al., 2008; Loria et
al., 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2006; Mutze et al., 2003). In the present study therefore, the role
of MPO in these important events leading to NM-induced skin pathology was analyzed
using MPO KO mice. Similar to earlier reports with SM and to our previous studies with
CEES and NM, NM exposure in WT mice caused a robust NM-induced increase in
neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity (Blank et al., 2000; Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et al.,
2011b; Millard et al., 1997; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009; Vavra et al., 2004). However, this
NM-induced increase in MPO activity was not observed in MPO KO mice confirming these
mice were suitable for this study. Skin edema and hyperproliferation are important events of
vesicant exposure that are referred to as injury and healing markers, respectively, as reported
in our earlier studies (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). NM caused an increase
in skin bi-fold and epidermal thickness of WT mice. However, no significant NM-induced
increment in either of these markers was observed in MPO KO mice, indicating less injury
and proliferation of cells to compensate for the cell death of effected epidermal
keratinocytes. Our data also showed much lower NM-induced DNA damage (Phospho-
H2A.X Ser139 IHC staining) and apoptotic cell death (TUNEL staining) in epidermal
keratinocytes of MPO KO mice compared to WT mice. Since, DNA damage and apoptotic
cell death are main consequences of SM exposure leading to skin injuries (Kehe and Szinicz,
2005; Mellor et al., 1991; Papirmeister et al., 1985; Paromov et al., 2007), a decrease in
these effects evidenced in MPO KO mice suggests a vital role of MPO in NM-induced DNA
damage and cell death. These are probably due to MPO’s ability to induce oxidative stress.

SM exposure causes blister formation (vesication) in human skin and microvesication in
animals’ skin (Cowan et al., 2003; Ghabili et al., 2010; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Smith et al.,
1995). Vesication occurs due to apoptosis in basal keratinocytes and degradation of the
anchoring filaments. laminin-5, collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) after
SM exposure (Hess and FitzGerald, 2007). These proteases are either secreted by
neutrophils or are directly activated by SM at the time of injury, leading to blister formation
(Chang et al., 2009; Mol et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2002; Sabourin et al., 2002). Similar to the
microvesication observed following SM exposure as well as our previous studies with CEES
and NM, in this study NM induced microvesication in WT mice in this study. However this
lesion was attenuated in the NM treated MPO KO mice. Since, vesication is associated with
apoptotic cell death, decreased NM-induced apoptotic cell death in keratinocytes of MPO
KO mice in comparison with WT mice observed here could contribute to decreased
microvesication in MPO KO mice. It has been reported that proteases such as MMP-9,
which degrade collagen and other ECM proteins are important mediators in 
vesicant-induced blister formation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Ries et al., 2009; Shakarjian et
al., 2006). Attenuation of the NM-induced MMP-9 expression in MPO KO mice here further
suggests a role for MPO in vesicating effects of NM. Our findings support previous studies
which show that MPO-derived HOCl modulated the activity of MMPs (Lau et al., 2005).
Many studies have reported an increased expression and importance of inflammatory
mediators like COX-2 (the rate limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis) in the skin
after exposure to SM or its analog CEES (Black et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2011a; Joseph et al.,
2011; Pal et al., 2009; Shakarjian et al., 2010). This increase in COX-2 expression could
enhance vascular permeability and the further influx of inflammatory cells (Jain et al.,
2011a). Our earlier studies also documented that CEES induced an increase in the
expression of iNOS, an inducible form of the rate limiting enzyme that makes nitric oxide
(NO) in mouse skin. This could be due to neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the skin
(Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009). In our study, the observed decrease in NM-induced
expression of both COX-2 and iNOS in MPO KO mice compared to WT mice could have
further caused decreased inflammatory response in KO mice. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized
by iNOS also plays a potential role in wound healing depending on the production of
peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which can lead to oxidation of cellular molecules, targets (Korkmaz
et al., 2006). MPO-derived secondary oxidants play a role in modulating signaling pathways
by oxidizing endothelial-derived NO (Lau et al., 2005). Results here also suggest that MPO
deficiency caused a reduction in NM-induced induction of iNOS expression in MPO KO
mice as compared to control mice at corresponding time points. This could decrease
ONOO− by modulating NO-related pathways and subsequent DNA damage as well as cell
death.
Earlier reports have shown the involvement of oxidative stress in vesicant-induced
activation of DNA damage and MAPK/Akt-NF-kB/AP-1 signaling pathways, and induction
of inflammatory mediators in resulting skin injuries (Black et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2011a;
Laskin et al., 2010; Pal et al., 2009). The NM-induced WT skin injury could, in part, be due
to oxidative stress caused by numerous reactive oxidants from HOCl production or
enhanced iNOS expression following the release of MPO from neutrophils. In addition,
HOCl generation from MPO can also activate regulatory molecules like p53 and members of

the MAPK pathway (Mutze et al., 2003). Therefore, deletion of MPO in MPO KO mice
might be affecting various signaling pathways and oxidative stress, and the injury effects
related to DNA damage, cell death and inflammation in these mice. However, these same
pro-inflammatory properties of MPO make it a major player in the innate response to
foreign invasion and contribute to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils, an important
aspect of host defense (Malle et al., 2007). This positive aspect of MPO is important to
consider during the development of mechanism-based MPO inhibitors for treatment of
injuries. This study also forms the basis of further critical investigation of mechanisms
involved in MPO-derived oxidant-induced tissue damage and initiation as well as
progression of the SM- and NM-related inflammatory response.

Abstract
The pathologic mechanisms of skin injuries, following the acute inflammatory response induced
by vesicating agents sulfur mustard (SM) and nitrogen mustard (NM) exposure, are poorly
understood. Neutrophils which accumulate at the site of injury, abundantly express
myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein that is implicated in oxidant-related antimicrobial and
cytotoxic responses. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to SM analog 2-chloroethyl
ethyl sulfide (CEES) or NM results in an inflammatory response including increased neutrophilic
infiltration and MPO activity. To further define the role of neutrophil-derived MPO in 
NM-induced skin injury, here we used a genetic approach and examined the effect of NM exposure (12
h and 24 h) on previously established injury endpoints in C57BL/6J wild type (WT) and
B6.129X1-MPOtm1Lus/J mice (MPO KO), homozygous null for MPO gene. NM exposure
caused a significant increase in skin bi-fold thickness, epidermal thickness, microvesication, DNA
damage and apoptosis in WT mice compared to MPO KO mice. MPO KO mice showed relatively
insignificant effect. Similarly, NM-induced increases in the expression of inflammatory and
proteolytic mediators, including COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 in WT mice, while having a
significantly lower effect in MPO KO mice. Collectively, these results show that MPO, which
generates microbicidal oxidants, plays an important role in NM-induced skin injuries. This
suggests the development of mechanism-based treatments against NM- and SM-induced skin
injuries that inhibit MPO activity and attenuate MPO-derived oxidants.

4. Discussion
Although substantial research efforts have focused on understanding the mechanisms of skin
injuries from SM exposure, process causing cutaneous lesions via acute inflammatory
response after SM exposure is poorly understood. Earlier studies have shown that PMNs,
mainly neutrophils, accumulate at the site of injury after SM exposure (Joseph et al., 2011;
Shakarjian et al., 2010; Vavra et al., 2004). Similarly, our studies following exposure to SM
analogs CEES and NM have also shown infiltration of inflammatory cells including
neutrophils with greatly elevated MPO activity in mouse skin (Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et al.,
2011a; Jain et al., 2011b; Pal et al., 2009; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). Vesicant-induced
neutrophil infiltration elicits MPO enzyme secretion which could enhance oxidative stress
and inflammation in skin, and this plays an important role in resulting skin injuries.
Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of neutrophil derived MPO enzyme
in the inflammation-related mechanism of NM-induced skin injuries. Our results from this
study using MPO KO mice demonstrate for the first time that MPO plays an important role

in NM-induced skin injury by attenuating DNA damage, cell death, vesication and
inflammation.
Due to limited access to SM, we used NM in this study because both SM and NM are
vesicating and powerful alkylating and vesicating agents that show toxic effects following
cutaneous exposure (Smith et al., 1998; Tewari-Singh et al., 2013; Wormser et al., 2002).
We employed established NM-induced endpoints from our previous studies (Inturi et al.,
2013 and unpublished data) in this study in C57BL/6J mice, since MPO KO mice were
produced on a C57BL/6 background.
Both SM- and NM-induced skin injuries occur mainly due to their alkylating properties and
direct DNA damage (Inturi et al., 2011; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005; Walker, 1971). However,
generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS or RNS) after SM and NM exposure
also have been shown to cause DNA damage leading to injuries (Kehe et al., 2009; Laskin et
al., 2010; Naghii, 2002; Shakarjian et al., 2010). These injuries occur largely due to the
sensitivity of the basal epidermal keratinocytes to SM where DNA damage is a major
element (Dacre and Goldman, 1996; Graham et al., 2005; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005;
Papirmeister et al., 1985). The Inflammatory response is considered to play a vital role in
SM-induced pathology; neutrophil infiltration is a major early event in the inflammatory
response (Lindsay and Rice, 1996; Millard et al., 1997). The neutrophil infiltration could
contribute to oxidative stress and DNA damage, and could cause secondary injuries and
inflammation. This may be attributed to the secretion of MPO by azurophilic granules of
activated neutrophils at the site of inflammation which oxidizes Cl− to hypoclorus acid
(HOCl), a reactive oxidant, and causes indirect DNA damage (El Kebir et al., 2008; Loria et
al., 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2006; Mutze et al., 2003). In the present study therefore, the role
of MPO in these important events leading to NM-induced skin pathology was analyzed
using MPO KO mice. Similar to earlier reports with SM and to our previous studies with
CEES and NM, NM exposure in WT mice caused a robust NM-induced increase in
neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity (Blank et al., 2000; Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et al.,
2011b; Millard et al., 1997; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009; Vavra et al., 2004). However, this
NM-induced increase in MPO activity was not observed in MPO KO mice confirming these
mice were suitable for this study. Skin edema and hyperproliferation are important events of
vesicant exposure that are referred to as injury and healing markers, respectively, as reported
in our earlier studies (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). NM caused an increase
in skin bi-fold and epidermal thickness of WT mice. However, no significant NM-induced
increment in either of these markers was observed in MPO KO mice, indicating less injury
and proliferation of cells to compensate for the cell death of effected epidermal
keratinocytes. Our data also showed much lower NM-induced DNA damage (Phospho-
H2A.X Ser139 IHC staining) and apoptotic cell death (TUNEL staining) in epidermal
keratinocytes of MPO KO mice compared to WT mice. Since, DNA damage and apoptotic
cell death are main consequences of SM exposure leading to skin injuries (Kehe and Szinicz,
2005; Mellor et al., 1991; Papirmeister et al., 1985; Paromov et al., 2007), a decrease in
these effects evidenced in MPO KO mice suggests a vital role of MPO in NM-induced DNA
damage and cell death. These are probably due to MPO’s ability to induce oxidative stress.

SM exposure causes blister formation (vesication) in human skin and microvesication in
animals’ skin (Cowan et al., 2003; Ghabili et al., 2010; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Smith et al.,
1995). Vesication occurs due to apoptosis in basal keratinocytes and degradation of the
anchoring filaments. laminin-5, collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) after
SM exposure (Hess and FitzGerald, 2007). These proteases are either secreted by
neutrophils or are directly activated by SM at the time of injury, leading to blister formation
(Chang et al., 2009; Mol et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2002; Sabourin et al., 2002). Similar to the
microvesication observed following SM exposure as well as our previous studies with CEES
and NM, in this study NM induced microvesication in WT mice in this study. However this
lesion was attenuated in the NM treated MPO KO mice. Since, vesication is associated with
apoptotic cell death, decreased NM-induced apoptotic cell death in keratinocytes of MPO
KO mice in comparison with WT mice observed here could contribute to decreased
microvesication in MPO KO mice. It has been reported that proteases such as MMP-9,
which degrade collagen and other ECM proteins are important mediators in 
vesicant-induced blister formation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Ries et al., 2009; Shakarjian et
al., 2006). Attenuation of the NM-induced MMP-9 expression in MPO KO mice here further
suggests a role for MPO in vesicating effects of NM. Our findings support previous studies
which show that MPO-derived HOCl modulated the activity of MMPs (Lau et al., 2005).
Many studies have reported an increased expression and importance of inflammatory
mediators like COX-2 (the rate limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis) in the skin
after exposure to SM or its analog CEES (Black et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2011a; Joseph et al.,
2011; Pal et al., 2009; Shakarjian et al., 2010). This increase in COX-2 expression could
enhance vascular permeability and the further influx of inflammatory cells (Jain et al.,
2011a). Our earlier studies also documented that CEES induced an increase in the
expression of iNOS, an inducible form of the rate limiting enzyme that makes nitric oxide
(NO) in mouse skin. This could be due to neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the skin
(Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009). In our study, the observed decrease in NM-induced
expression of both COX-2 and iNOS in MPO KO mice compared to WT mice could have
further caused decreased inflammatory response in KO mice. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized
by iNOS also plays a potential role in wound healing depending on the production of
peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which can lead to oxidation of cellular molecules, targets (Korkmaz
et al., 2006). MPO-derived secondary oxidants play a role in modulating signaling pathways
by oxidizing endothelial-derived NO (Lau et al., 2005). Results here also suggest that MPO
deficiency caused a reduction in NM-induced induction of iNOS expression in MPO KO
mice as compared to control mice at corresponding time points. This could decrease
ONOO− by modulating NO-related pathways and subsequent DNA damage as well as cell
death.
Earlier reports have shown the involvement of oxidative stress in vesicant-induced
activation of DNA damage and MAPK/Akt-NF-kB/AP-1 signaling pathways, and induction
of inflammatory mediators in resulting skin injuries (Black et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2011a;
Laskin et al., 2010; Pal et al., 2009). The NM-induced WT skin injury could, in part, be due
to oxidative stress caused by numerous reactive oxidants from HOCl production or
enhanced iNOS expression following the release of MPO from neutrophils. In addition,
HOCl generation from MPO can also activate regulatory molecules like p53 and members of

the MAPK pathway (Mutze et al., 2003). Therefore, deletion of MPO in MPO KO mice
might be affecting various signaling pathways and oxidative stress, and the injury effects
related to DNA damage, cell death and inflammation in these mice. However, these same
pro-inflammatory properties of MPO make it a major player in the innate response to
foreign invasion and contribute to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils, an important
aspect of host defense (Malle et al., 2007). This positive aspect of MPO is important to
consider during the development of mechanism-based MPO inhibitors for treatment of
injuries. This study also forms the basis of further critical investigation of mechanisms
involved in MPO-derived oxidant-induced tissue damage and initiation as well as
progression of the SM- and NM-related inflammatory response.

3. Results
3.1 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced tissue MPO activity
Our previous studies in mice have shown a profound increase in neutrophil infiltration and
MPO activity in skin after dorsal exposure with CEES and NM at 12 h and 24 h time points
(Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). To further investigate the
role of the neutrophil-derived MPO enzyme in NM-induced skin injury, we employed a
genetic approach using MPO KO mice where neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity were
determined following NM exposure. H&E staining of the skin tissue sections from wild type
and MPO KO mice 12 h and 24 h after NM exposure showed high neutrophil infiltration and
dermal edema in NM-exposed wild type mice as compared with an untreated control (Fig.
1A). However, the NM-induced increase in neutrophil infiltration or edema was not evident
in MPO KO mice (Fig. 1C). To confirm the absence of MPO activity and the markedly
diminished neutrophil infiltration in MPO KO mice, MPO activity was measured in wild
type and MPO KO mice (Fig. 1B and D). In comparison with control wild type mice where
MPO activity was 2.4 mU/μg protein, high MPO activity was observed after 12 h (16.3
mU/μg protein) of NM exposure. This was maximal at 24 h (116.9 mU/μg protein) 
post-exposure (Fig. 1B). Conversely, very low MPO activity was observed in MPO KO mice at
12 h (2.14 mU/μg protein) and 24 h (1.40 mU/μg protein) post-NM exposure, which was
comparable to MPO activity in control mice (1.48 mU/μg protein; Fig. 1D).
3.2 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced skin bi-fold thickness and epidermal
thickness increases
Our previous studies have shown that CEES and NM caused an increase in skin bi-fold
thickness and epidermal thickness in mice (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2013;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). To examine whether similar effects were present in NM-treated
COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 were detected in frozen skin tissue samples by Western blotting.
Approximately 100 mg of tissue was taken from the skin samples and homogenized in lysis
buffer as published earlier (Jain et al., 2011a) and protein content was measured using
Lowry’s method (Lowry et al., 1951). For western blotting, 50 μg of protein from three
animals per group was subjected to SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane by western blotting. After blocking, membranes were probed with
primary antibodies against COX-2 (1:500), iNOS (1:500), and MMP-9 (1:500) for overnight
at 4°C, followed by peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. Protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). In each case, protein loading was
monitored by stripping and re-probing the blots with β-actin.

MPO KO mice, we first measured the skin bi-fold thickness at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure.
In WT mice, NM caused a significant (p<0.05) increase in skin bi-fold thickness after 24 h
(1.46 fold) in comparison with the untreated control. On the other hand, a significant
increase in bi-fold thickness was not observed in MPO KO mice at 12 h (1.3 fold) or 24 h
(1.04 fold) post-NM exposure in comparison with control (Fig. 2A). H&E stained tissue
sections from both types of mice were next analyzed for epidermal thickness at 12 h and 24
h after NM exposure. In wild type mice, NM caused a significant (P<0.05) 2.2-fold increase
in epidermal thickness at 12 h following exposure (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, there was no
significant effect of NM on epidermal thickness in MPO KO mice at 12 h or 24 h 
post-exposure (Fig. 2E).
3.3 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced microvesication
Our previous studies have reported that CEES and NM cause microvesication in mice, and
established this lesion as an important biomarker of vesicant skin injury (Jain et al., 2011b;
Tewari-Singh et al., 2013; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). Similar to our previous reports,
microvesication (epidermal-dermal separation) was observed 12 h and 24 h post-NM
exposure in WT mice. However, these events were reduced in MPO KO mice (Fig. 3A and
C). The incidence of microvesication was quantified according to their size; small
(<100μm2), medium (100-500 μm2) and large (>500 μm2) per skin section of mice. In WT
mice, small NM-induced lesions of microvesication were 5.0 ± 0.70 at 12 h and 4.05 ± 0.65
at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 3B). NM-induced lesions of medium and large sized
microvesicles gradually increased and were maximal at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 3A and B)
In MPO KO mice, lesser incidences of all sizes of microvesication lesions were observed in
comparison with WT mice at both 12 h and 24 h post-NM exposure (Fig. 3 C and D).
Maximal occurrence of small sized NM-induced lesions of microvesication in WT mice,
were 2.5 ± 0.71 and 3.15 ± 0.70 at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure, respectively, in MPO KO
mice (Fig. 3D).
3.4 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced DNA damage and apoptotic cell death
Phospho-H2A.X Ser139 is a marker of DNA damage (Rogakou et al., 1998), that is shown
to increase following vesicant exposure indicating DNA damage (Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et
al., 2011a; Joseph et al., 2011; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Previously, our studies have
shown that CEES or NM exposure causes DNA damage leading to cell death of skin
keratinocytes, and this could be a major contributor of skin injury (Inturi et al., 2013; Jain et
al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). Since MPO takes part in the
production of free radicals which may cause DNA damage and apoptotic cell death, we
examined the hypothesis that ablation of PMN and MPO activity would decrease the DNA
damage and cell death following NM treatment. In WT mice, NM exposure resulted in a
significant (p<0.05) increase in the number of phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells (Fig.
4A). After 12 h and 24 h of NM exposure in WT mice, 48.2 ± 3.5% and 47.6 ± 1.4% H2A.X
Ser139 positive cells, respectively, were observed in NM-exposed mice compared with only
20 ± 1.0% phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells in control mice skin (Fig. 4B). In skin
tissue from MPO KO mice, 33 ± 4.8% and 37 ± 1.3% phospho-H2A.X Ser139 positive cells
were observed at 12 h and 24 h post-NM exposure compared with 18 ± 8.2% positive cells
in control. However, this increase was not significant (Fig. 4C and D). Apoptotic cell death,

which is one of the early responses in NM-induced skin injury, was analyzed by TUNEL
staining. Quantification of data from TUNEL-stained skin sections from WT mice showed a
significantly (P<0.05) increased percent of apoptotic cell death at 12 h (49 ± 2.5%) and 24 h
(42 ± 0.68%) after NM exposure in comparison with the untreated control (26.%; Fig. 4E
and F). However, in skin tissues from MPO KO mice, no significant increase in apoptotic
cell death was observed at 12 h (19 ± 3.4%) and 24 h (25 ± 2.2%) after NM exposure, again
when compared with control (16 ± 6.8%; Fig. 4G and H).
3.5 MPO deletion in mice attenuated NM-induced COX-2, iNOS and MMP-9 levels
It has been previously reported that COX-2 and iNOS play important roles in SM and 
SM-analog induced skin injury and inflammation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009). Therefore,
levels of COX-2 and iNOS were quantitated by western blotting following NM exposure.
These blots clearly showed an NM-induced increase in expression of COX-2 at 12 h (18.3
fold) and 24 h (15.9 fold) post-exposure; this increase was completely attenuated in MPO
KO mice (Fig. 5A). Similarly, NM exposure also caused an increase in iNOS levels at 12 h
(5.3 fold) and 24 h (7.3 fold) post-NM exposure, when compared to control skin tissue in
WT mice (Fig. 5 A). In MPO KO mice, NM-exposure failed to increase the quantity of
iNOS at 12 h post-exposure. However, at 24 h post-exposure NM induced an increase in
iNOS in the MPO KO mice albeit less than that observed in WT mice (Fig. 5A).
As described above, NM exposure caused an increased number of microvesication lesions in
WT mice when compared to MPO KO mice. MMP-9 levels are reported to increase after
vesicant exposure and this plays a role in microvesication because it can degrade the
components of extracellular matrix and basement membrane allowing epidermal dermal
separation (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009; Shakarjian et al., 2010). To elucidate the role
of the MPO enzyme in microvesication, MMP-9 expression was measured at 12 h and 24 h
following NM exposure in both WT and MPO KO mice (Fig. 5B). NM exposure caused an
increase in MMP-9 levels at 12 h (26 fold) and 24 h (10.2 fold) post-exposure in WT mice.
However, in MPO KO mice, NM exposure induced only a slight increase in MMP-9 levels
at both 12 h (3.3 fold) and 24 h (4.4 fold) post-exposure (Fig. 5 B).

Sulfur mustard; nitrogen mustard; myeloperoxidase; inflammation; apoptosis; DNA damage
Sulfur mustard [SM; bis (2-chloroethyl) sulfide] and nitrogen mustard (NM;
mechlorethamine) are primary vesicating agents, which pose potential threat for use in
chemical warfare and terrorist attack (Saladi et al., 2006; Sharma et al., 2010; Smith et al.,
1995). Both of these mustard agents are highly toxic bifunctional alkylating agents, which
upon exposure cause severe skin injury including inflammation and disruption of 
epidermal-dermal layers leading to vesication (Graham et al., 2005; Hayden et al., 2009; Jain et al.,
2011b; Joseph et al., 2011; Laskin et al., 2010; McManus and Huebner, 2005). In the past
few years, numerous studies have been carried out to explore the mechanisms of cell death,
inflammation and vesication caused by warfare and alkylating agent SM exposure (Casillas
et al., 2000; Inturi et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2011b; Kehe et al., 2009; Kehe and Szinicz, 2005;
Pal et al., 2009; Rice, 2003; Shakarjian et al., 2010; Tewari-Singh et al., 2010). However,
further investigations are needed to define the mechanism of skin injury and healing
processes after vesicant exposure, especially pathogenesis involving the inflammatory
response where infiltration of polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMNs) is reported to play
an important role (Dacre and Goldman, 1996; Graham et al., 2005; Millard et al., 1997;
Wormser, 1991).
SM-induced PMN infiltration, mainly neutrophils, has been shown as an early event
occurring within 30 min and peaking at 6-12 h post-exposure in human skin (Lindsay and
Rice, 1996; Millard et al., 1997; Wormser et al., 2005). Neutrophil infiltration plays a key
role in host defense. However, its excessive stimulation induces the release of cytokines and
growth factors which contribute to the healing process (Segal, 2005; Weiss, 1989).
Conversely, neutrophils and to some extent monocytes and macrophages, secrete
myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO is a member of heme peroxidase-cyclooxygenase family, at
the site of tissue injury generating powerful oxidants, free radicals and hypochlorous acid,
which can cause tissue injury (Brennan et al., 2001; Klebanoff, 2005; Shiba et al., 2008).
Infiltration of neutrophils also plays an important role in blister formation by secreting a
variety of proteolytic enzymes including collagenase, gelatinase and elastase. These
enzymesare able to degrade specific elements in the extracellular matrix leading to
epidermal-dermal separation as observed in skin diseases like psoriasis (Glinski et al., 1990)
and bullous pemphigoid (Liu et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2000). SM-induced biochemical
changes include high MPO activity, free radical generation and cytokine production (Ham et
al., 2012). Our previous studies with SM analog 2, chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) and NM
have shown an increase in neutrophil infiltration and MPO (a marker indicating neutrophil
infiltration) activity in mouse skin (Jain et al., 2011b; Tewari-Singh et al., 2009). We have
also shown that both CEES and NM exposure induces DNA damage, cell death, oxidative
stress, microvesication, activation of proteolytic and inflammatory mediators as well as
related signaling pathways. These previous studies indicated that neutrophil-derived MPO
could play a vital role in vesicant-induced skin lesions (Jain et al., 2011a; Pal et al., 2009;
