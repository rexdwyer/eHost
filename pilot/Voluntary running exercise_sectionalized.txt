MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Montreal. Male obese
ZDF rats (ZDF Leprfa/fa) and their control ZL (fa/ or /) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Constant, QC,
Canada) at 5 wk of age. Rats were housed in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled facility on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with free
access to rodent chow (Purina 5008) and tap water.
Animals were assigned to the following three experimental groups:
ZL inactive (ZL-I; n  19), ZDF inactive (ZDF-I; n  22), and
physically active ZDF (ZDF-A; n  19). All animals were housed in
a wheel cage consisting of a stainless steel live-in wheel (circumfer-
ence: 1.445 m, width: 16 cm) mounted on a shaft containing a
low-friction ball-bearing collar with a running surface of 4-mm-wide
stainless steel mesh as described earlier (46). Each wheel was
equipped with a sensor and wired to a computer where wheel 
revolutions were recorded continuously for the assessment of the rat’s
activity. The distance run per day was calculated as the number of
wheel revolutions over a 24-h period and was reported two times a
week. For the following 6 wk, ZDF-A rats engaged in voluntary
running. ZL-I and ZDF-I groups were prevented from running by
wheel blocks. Running wheels were blocked 24 h before GTTs and
death. An early subset of data collected from n  8-9 rats/group has
been reported elsewhere (44).
Body weight, food intake, running distance, and periodically 
measured plasma parameters. Running distance, body weight, and food
intake were measured two times weekly. Heparinized tail blood was
collected weekly at 8:00-9:00 A.M. from awake fed rats for plasma
glucose, insulin, TG, NEFA, and corticosterone determinations as
indicated in corresponding Figs. 1- 6. Plasma glucose, TG, and
NEFA were measured by colorimetric enzyme kit assays (respec-
tively, Wako Chemical, Osaka, Japan; GPO Trinder, 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; NEFA C kit, Wako Chemical, Neuss,
Germany) and plasma insulin and corticosterone by 
radioimmuno-assay kits (respectively, Linco Research, St. Louis, MO, and MP
Biomedicals, Orangeburg, NY).
Glucose tolerance test. After 37-38 days of the intervention period
and at midday after 4 h of fasting, animals were subjected to an oral
glucose tolerance test (oGTT) (2 g glucose/kg body wt). Tail blood
was collected for glucose measurements (One Touch Ultra; LifeScan)
and plasma insulin determinations at the time points as indicated in
Figs. 1-6. The insulinogenic index derived from the oGTT was
calculated according to the following formula: [30 min insulin (U/

ml) fasting insulin]/[30 min glucose (mmol/l) fasting glucose], as
previously described (26, 57).
Death and blood and tissue harvesting. After 44-46 days of
intervention (12-wk-old rats), fed rats were anesthetized between 8:00
and 9:00 A.M. with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, Somnotol; MTC
Pharmaceuticals, Hamilton, ON, Canada) and killed by 
exsanguina-tion. Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava for the 
determination of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and active
glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), as previously described (27). For
ACTH and GLP-1, blood was transferred to, respectively, 
EDTA-Trasylol and EDTA-dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitor-treated prechilled 
mi-crotubes. Pancreatic islet isolation was performed by collagenase
injection in the bile duct, pancreas resection, digestion at 37°C,
histopaque gradient separation, and hand-picking under a 
stereomi-croscope, as previously described (11, 39). Epididymal white adipose
tissue (EWAT), muscles (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus), liver,
and heart were dissected and immediately frozen under liquid 
nitrogen, weighed, and stored at 80°C.
Plasma GLP-1, ACTH, and nonislet tissue assays. Kit assays were
used for plasma GLP-1 (active) (Linco Research) and ACTH (MP
Biomedicals) measurements. Liver TG content was estimated from
glycerol released after ethanolic KOH hydrolysis, employing a 
commercial kit as described above. Liver and muscle glycogen content
and muscle cytochrome oxidase activity were determined as 
previously described (1, 37).
Islet insulin secretion and insulin content measurements. Before
experiments, islets were cultured for 1 h in RPMI-1640 medium (11).
Isolated islets were distributed into 12-well plates (6 islets/well in
triplicates) and incubated for 2 h in 1 ml RPMI complete medium
containing 3 mmol/l glucose. They were then washed and 
preincu-bated for 40 min at 37°C in 1 ml Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer
containing 10 mmol/l HEPES (KRBH; pH 7.4), 0.5% defatted BSA,
and 3 mmol/l glucose. The islets were then incubated for 45 min in 0.5
ml of KRBH containing 3, 8, and 16 mmol/l glucose plus 0.5%
defatted BSA, in the presence or absence of 0.3 mmol/l palmitate or
3 mmol/l glucose plus KCl (35 mmol/l). At the end of the incubation,
media were collected for insulin determination. Total islet insulin
content was measured after acid-ethanol (0.2 mmol/l HCl in 75%
ethanol) extraction. Batches of 20 freshly isolated islets, 
representative of those taken for the secretion studies, were used to determine
islet protein content, as described previously (11, 39).
Fatty acid oxidation and esterification. Total fatty acid oxidation
(from exogenous and endogenous NEFA sources) and esterification
were measured in isolated islets, as previously described (11).
Lipolysis. Islet glycerol released into the incubation medium during
the final 2 h of the fatty acid oxidation assessments was used to
indirectly determine islet lipolysis, as previously described (39).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted immediately
after islet isolation using a kit (RNeasy Mini; Qiagen, Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada) with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2
g of RNA. PCR amplification of the genes of interest was performed
using primers previously described (11). PCR products were 
normalized by the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A, and results are 
expressed as arbitrary units.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as means  SE.
Statistical differences of group means were calculated using one- or
two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. A P value
of 0.05 was considered significant.

improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its contribution
to preserving -cell function is uncertain. We evaluated the role of
physical activity on -cell secretory function and glycerolipid/fatty acid
(GL/FA) cycling in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Six-week-old
ZDF rats engaged in voluntary running for 6 wk (ZDF-A). Inactive
Zucker lean and ZDF (ZDF-I) rats served as controls. ZDF-I rats
displayed progressive hyperglycemia with -cell failure evidenced by
falling insulinemia and reduced insulin secretion to oral glucose. Isolated
ZDF-I rat islets showed reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
expressed per islet and per islet protein. They were also characterized by
loss of the glucose regulation of fatty acid oxidation and GL/FA cycling,
reduced
mRNA expression of key -cell genes, and severe reduction of
insulin stores. Physical activity prevented diabetes in ZDF rats through
sustaining -cell compensation to insulin resistance shown in vivo and in
vitro. Surprisingly, ZDF-A islets had persistent defects in fatty acid
oxidation, GL/FA cycling, and -cell gene expression. ZDF-A islets,
however, had preserved islet insulin mRNA and insulin stores compared
with ZDF-I rats. Physical activity did not prevent hyperphagia, 
dyslipi-demia, or obesity in ZDF rats. In conclusion, islets of ZDF rats have a
susceptibility to failure that is possibly due to altered -cell fatty acid
metabolism. Depletion of pancreatic islet insulin stores is a major 
contributor to islet failure in this T2D model, preventable by physical
activity.

INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) is a predisposing factor for the 
development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, it must be 
combined with failure of -cell compensation for IR for T2D to
occur (18, 42). Diet and exercise programs can reduce T2D
development in humans with impaired glucose tolerance (35,
54). Thus, it is likely that the exercise interventions prevent
islet -cell failure (18, 42). Despite the abundant literature
supporting the beneficial effects of exercise on insulin action
(30), much less is known about the effects of exercise on -cell
function. In young individuals, exercise training decreased
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (8, 20, 28). Trained

weight to obese subjects also demonstrated a lower acute
insulin response during an intravenous glucose tolerance test
(GTT) (48). These results most probably reflect lower insulin
requirement due to improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore,
Dela and Stallknecht (9) demonstrated that 12 wk of endurance
exercise training did not increase GSIS in first-degree offspring
of T2D patients. On the other hand, these same authors showed
that diabetic subjects with good residual insulin secretory
capacity had increased GSIS following endurance training,
whereas those with low residual secretory capacity did not
improve upon training (10). Of note, Slentz et al. (48), using
the disposition index as a reflection of -cell function, 
suggested that the latter is improved by moderate-intensity 
exercise training. All together, the evidence suggests that the health
status of subjects and methodologies employed to study -cell
function are key parameters that influenced the outcome of
those studies.
The Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat is a severely 
insulin-resistant genetic model of obesity-related T2D. Unlike the
Zucker fatty (ZF) rat that is able to sustain -cell compensation
for IR, the ZDF rat is prone to -cell failure. Exercise prevents
diabetes in this animal model (6, 21, 22, 41, 49). Pold et al. (41)
showed that treadmill-trained ZDF rats did not develop 
hyperglycemia. In that study, exercise improved peripheral and
hepatic insulin action and islet morphology (41). Colombo et
al. (6), using a similar exercise protocol, reported that training
did not markedly influence gene expression in ZDF rat islets,
whereas important gene alterations were found in liver and
muscles (6). Kiraly et al. (21, 22) reported that swimming also
prevented hyperglycemia in ZDF rats, which was associated
with enhanced insulin secretion during intraperitoneal GTT
and improved islet morphology with increased -cell 
proliferation and -cell mass. However, the nature of islet 
susceptibility to failure in the ZDF rat is not known as well as the basis
of diabetes prevention by exercise.
Studies conducted in islets of the obese, but diabetes 
resistant, ZF rat, a model for -cell compensation, have shown
increased -cell mass and functional islet changes, including
enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism, processes that favor
production of nutrient-secretion coupling signals (25, 32).
Isolated ZF islets have shown enhanced palmitate 
augmentation of GSIS (32), a finding associated with enhanced 
glucose-responsive glycerolipid/fatty acid (GL/FA) cycling (32). Both
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) esterification into glycerolipids
such as triglycerides (TG) and diacylglycerols (DAG) and the
lipolysis of GLs were increased in ZF islets, particularly at
http://www.ajpendo.orgE254
increased glucose concentrations. Furthermore, lipolysis 
inhibition by the lipase inhibitor orlistat markedly reduced GSIS in
these islets (32). Thus, GL/FA cycling may provide a 
mechanism by which the -cell in ZF rat islets escapes 
glucolipotoxicity and compensates for IR without the development of
diabetes (33).
The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
biochemical basis of the effects of physical activity on islet function in
ZDF rats in which diabetes is prevented by voluntary running
in wheel cages (23, 44). Particular focus was placed on whether
preserved -cell performance in exercised ZDF rats could be
linked to the compensatory pathway of enhanced GL/FA 
cycling similar to what was observed in compensating islets of
ZF rats. We found that voluntary running markedly improved
GSIS in ZDF rat islets, but not quite to the level of function of
Zucker lean (ZL) control islets if GSIS
was expressed per islet
protein content. GL/FA cycling was abnormal in ZDF rats,
which was not normalized by physical activity. Voluntary
running had a dramatic effect on preventing depletion of islet
insulin stores in this diabetes-prone obese rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Montreal. Male obese
ZDF rats (ZDF Leprfa/fa) and their control ZL (fa/ or /) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Constant, QC,
Canada) at 5 wk of age. Rats were housed in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled facility on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with free
access to rodent chow (Purina 5008) and tap water.
Animals were assigned to the following three experimental groups:
ZL inactive (ZL-I; n  19), ZDF inactive (ZDF-I; n  22), and
physically active ZDF (ZDF-A; n  19). All animals were housed in
a wheel cage consisting of a stainless steel live-in wheel (circumfer-
ence: 1.445 m, width: 16 cm) mounted on a shaft containing a
low-friction ball-bearing collar with a running surface of 4-mm-wide
stainless steel mesh as described earlier (46). Each wheel was
equipped with a sensor and wired to a computer where wheel 
revolutions were recorded continuously for the assessment of the rat’s
activity. The distance run per day was calculated as the number of
wheel revolutions over a 24-h period and was reported two times a
week. For the following 6 wk, ZDF-A rats engaged in voluntary
running. ZL-I and ZDF-I groups were prevented from running by
wheel blocks. Running wheels were blocked 24 h before GTTs and
death. An early subset of data collected from n  8-9 rats/group has
been reported elsewhere (44).
Body weight, food intake, running distance, and periodically 
measured plasma parameters. Running distance, body weight, and food
intake were measured two times weekly. Heparinized tail blood was
collected weekly at 8:00-9:00 A.M. from awake fed rats for plasma
glucose, insulin, TG, NEFA, and corticosterone determinations as
indicated in corresponding Figs. 1- 6. Plasma glucose, TG, and
NEFA were measured by colorimetric enzyme kit assays (respec-
tively, Wako Chemical, Osaka, Japan; GPO Trinder, 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; NEFA C kit, Wako Chemical, Neuss,
Germany) and plasma insulin and corticosterone by 
radioimmuno-assay kits (respectively, Linco Research, St. Louis, MO, and MP
Biomedicals, Orangeburg, NY).
Glucose tolerance test. After 37-38 days of the intervention period
and at midday after 4 h of fasting, animals were subjected to an oral
glucose tolerance test (oGTT) (2 g glucose/kg body wt). Tail blood
was collected for glucose measurements (One Touch Ultra; LifeScan)
and plasma insulin determinations at the time points as indicated in
Figs. 1-6. The insulinogenic index derived from the oGTT was
calculated according to the following formula: [30 min insulin (U/

ml) fasting insulin]/[30 min glucose (mmol/l) fasting glucose], as
previously described (26, 57).
Death and blood and tissue harvesting. After 44-46 days of
intervention (12-wk-old rats), fed rats were anesthetized between 8:00
and 9:00 A.M. with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, Somnotol; MTC
Pharmaceuticals, Hamilton, ON, Canada) and killed by 
exsanguina-tion. Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava for the 
determination of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and active
glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), as previously described (27). For
ACTH and GLP-1, blood was transferred to, respectively, 
EDTA-Trasylol and EDTA-dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitor-treated prechilled 
mi-crotubes. Pancreatic islet isolation was performed by collagenase
injection in the bile duct, pancreas resection, digestion at 37°C,
histopaque gradient separation, and hand-picking under a 
stereomi-croscope, as previously described (11, 39). Epididymal white adipose
tissue (EWAT), muscles (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus), liver,
and heart were dissected and immediately frozen under liquid 
nitrogen, weighed, and stored at 80°C.
Plasma GLP-1, ACTH, and nonislet tissue assays. Kit assays were
used for plasma GLP-1 (active) (Linco Research) and ACTH (MP
Biomedicals) measurements. Liver TG content was estimated from
glycerol released after ethanolic KOH hydrolysis, employing a 
commercial kit as described above. Liver and muscle glycogen content
and muscle cytochrome oxidase activity were determined as 
previously described (1, 37).
Islet insulin secretion and insulin content measurements. Before
experiments, islets were cultured for 1 h in RPMI-1640 medium (11).
Isolated islets were distributed into 12-well plates (6 islets/well in
triplicates) and incubated for 2 h in 1 ml RPMI complete medium
containing 3 mmol/l glucose. They were then washed and 
preincu-bated for 40 min at 37°C in 1 ml Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer
containing 10 mmol/l HEPES (KRBH; pH 7.4), 0.5% defatted BSA,
and 3 mmol/l glucose. The islets were then incubated for 45 min in 0.5
ml of KRBH containing 3, 8, and 16 mmol/l glucose plus 0.5%
defatted BSA, in the presence or absence of 0.3 mmol/l palmitate or
3 mmol/l glucose plus KCl (35 mmol/l). At the end of the incubation,
media were collected for insulin determination. Total islet insulin
content was measured after acid-ethanol (0.2 mmol/l HCl in 75%
ethanol) extraction. Batches of 20 freshly isolated islets, 
representative of those taken for the secretion studies, were used to determine
islet protein content, as described previously (11, 39).
Fatty acid oxidation and esterification. Total fatty acid oxidation
(from exogenous and endogenous NEFA sources) and esterification
were measured in isolated islets, as previously described (11).
Lipolysis. Islet glycerol released into the incubation medium during
the final 2 h of the fatty acid oxidation assessments was used to
indirectly determine islet lipolysis, as previously described (39).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted immediately
after islet isolation using a kit (RNeasy Mini; Qiagen, Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada) with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2
g of RNA. PCR amplification of the genes of interest was performed
using primers previously described (11). PCR products were 
normalized by the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A, and results are 
expressed as arbitrary units.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as means  SE.
Statistical differences of group means were calculated using one- or
two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. A P value
of 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Body weight, food intake, and organ weights. ZDF-A rats
ran an average of 4.2 km/day over the 6 wk (Fig. 1A).
Differences in food intake or body weight were not observed
between ZDF-A and ZDF-I rats (Fig. 1, B and C). Both ZDF
groups remained markedly obese and hyperphagic compared
E256
ZUCKER DIABETIC FATTY RAT ISLET FUNCTION AND EXERCISE
with the ZL-I rats. There were changes, however, in body
composition between the ZDF rat groups at the end of the study
(Table 1). Plantaris and soleus muscles were heavier in ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats, while the heart followed this
tendency (P  0.052) and liver weight was reduced in ZDF-A
rats. EWAT tended to weigh less in ZDF-A compared with
ZDF-I rats (P 0.064) but was3.5-fold heavier than in ZL-I
rats.
Physical activity prevents the development of diabetes but
not severe dyslipidemia in ZDF rats. At 6 wk of age, ZDF-I
rats were normoglycemic and hypersinsulinemic. They became
diabetic by 9-10 wk of age while hyperinsulinemia 
progressively decreased past that age (Fig. 2, A and B). Voluntary
exercise prevented diabetes (Fig. 2A). The ZDF-A rats were
markedly hyperinsulinemic compared with the ZL-I rats, but
the levels in the first 2 wk of intervention were less than half

that required by the ZDF-I rats (Fig. 2B). While physical
activity prevented diabetes, it had no effect on the severe
hypertriglyceridemia of ZDF rats (Table 2). Fed-state plasma
active GLP-1 concentrations were higher in ZDF-A (7.8  1.2
pM) compared with ZL-I (4.6 0.6 pM; P 0.02) and tended
to be higher than ZDF-I (5.1  0.4 pM; P  0.06).
Voluntary running reduced hyperactivation of stress hormones.
Corticosterone levels were not increased in the ZDF-A compared
with ZDF-I rats; rather, there was a trend for them to fall in the
voluntary exercising group in the last few weeks of the 
intervention period (significantly reduced at week 4 of the 
interven-tion) (Fig. 2C). Plasma ACTH concentrations from samples
collected upon death were markedly lower in the ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats (Fig. 2D).
Voluntary exercise improves glucose tolerance through
maintenance of the glucose-stimulated insulin response. The
ZDF-I rats had markedly impaired glucose intolerance
(Fig. 3A). Voluntary running in the ZDF rats improved glucose
tolerance to levels similar to those seen in ZL-I rats (Fig. 3, A
and C). Furthermore, ZDF-A rats showed an increase in the
plasma insulin response compared with ZDF-I rats (Fig. 3B).
Improved pancreatic islet -cell function in ZDF-A vs. ZDF-I
rats was also evident from the insulinogenic index (Fig. 3E).
The insulin response of ZDF-A rats was markedly higher than
that of the ZL-I rats (Fig. 3, B and D).
Elevated nonislet tissue glycogen and TG contents are not
lowered by exercise in ZDF rats, but skeletal muscle 
mitochon-drial oxidative capacity is increased. Red and white 
gastrocnemius muscle glycogen levels were not affected by 6 wk of
voluntary running, being similar across all three rat groups
(data not shown). Liver glycogen content was lower in ZL-I
rats (130 9 mol/g; P 0.01) compared with both ZDF rats
(ZDF-A: 273  13 and ZDF-I: 261  13 mol/g). Liver TG
content was also lower in ZL-I rats compared with ZDF rats
(ZL-I: 8.0  0.4 mg/g vs. ZDF-A: 22.5  1.5 and ZDF-I:
21.1  1.0 mg/g; P  0.05). Higher liver glycogen and TG
contents observed in the ZDF rats were not affected by 
physical activity. However, muscle cytochrome oxidase activity, an
index of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, was increased in the
gastrocnemius in ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I rats (respec-
tively, 0.318  0.051 and 0.168  0.011 U/g in red 
gastrocnemius; P  0.05; 0.086  0.021 and 0.036  0.003 U/g in
white gastrocnemius; P  0.059).
Severe depletion of islet insulin stores in ZDF-i rats is
prevented by physical activity. Islets from ZDF-I rats were four
times larger than those of ZL-I rats based on protein content
with no difference in size evident between ZDF-I and ZDF-A
rats (Fig. 4A). Importantly, when insulin content was 
normalized to protein content, islets from ZDF-I rats showed an 86%

reduction compared with ZL-I islets. In contrast, partial but
significant preservation of the insulin stores was observed in
ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I islets (Fig. 4B).
Physical activity prevents loss of compensatory insulin 
hy-persecretion to glucose and palmitate in isolated islets from
ZDF rats. Insulin secretion in control ZL-I islets, expressed per
islet (Fig. 4C), was increased at intermediate (8 mmol/l) and
further increased at high (16 mmol/l) glucose concentrations
with potentiation by palmitate. Insulin secretion in ZDF-I islets
was similar to ZL-I islets at 8 mmol/l glucose with or without
palmitate, but further increases in secretion at 16 mmol/l
glucose
were not seen either in the presence or absence of
palmitate (Fig. 4C). In
contrast, islets from physically active
ZDF-A
rats showed an enhanced glucose and fatty 
acid-potentiated insulin secretion compared with ZL-I rats at both 8
and 16 mmol/l glucose (Fig. 4C). No significant effect of KCl
on insulin secretion was observed between the three groups
(Fig. 4C). Interestingly, if insulin secretion was normalized per
islet protein content (Fig. 4D), the ZL-I islets were found to
have significantly better insulin secretion in response to 16
mmol/l glucose in the presence or absence of palmitate than
both ZDF-I and ZDF-A islets. Expressed this way, ZDF-A
islets still had improved GSIS compared with ZDF-I islets,
although the difference did not reach statistical significance
(Fig. 4D). When GSIS was expressed as a percentage of
corrected total islet insulin content (sum of insulin content
measured at the end of the incubation period and the secreted
insulin within that period), the impairment of GSIS in ZDF-I

islets was no longer evident and was actually increased 
compared with ZL-I islets in response to KCl at 3 mmol/l glucose
(Fig. 4E).
Glycerolipid cycling and fatty acid oxidation in islets from
ZDF rats is unresponsive to glucose and is not influenced by
physical activity. All islet fatty acid metabolism data have been
corrected for islet protein content. The inhibitory effect of high
glucose concentrations on fatty acid oxidation was observed in
ZL-I rat islets (Fig. 5A). However, in both ZDF-I and ZDF-A,
fatty acid oxidation was reduced at both 3 and 8 mmol/l
compared with ZL-I islets. In addition, no inhibitory effect of
high glucose on islet fatty acid oxidation was observed in the
ZDF groups (Fig. 5A). After 16 h incubation (equilibrium
phase), net exogenous palmitate accumulation into intracellular
NEFAs was increased by 60-70% in islets of the ZDF-I and
ZDF-A rats compared with ZL-I islets (P  0.05; 2-way
ANOVA: group effect) (Fig. 5B). Net exogenous palmitate
esterification into total glycerolipids (monoacylglycerol
DAG TG) was increased by65-70% in islets of both ZDF
rat groups compared with ZL-I islets (P  0.05; 2-way
ANOVA, group effect) (Fig. 5C). Lipolysis of islet 
glycerolipids, as assessed by measurement of glycerol release, was
increased by 85% at 16 compared with 3 mmol/l glucose in
islets from ZL-I rats (Fig. 5D). Basal lipolysis was not different
between islets of the three rat groups, but, in contrast to ZL-I
islets, islets of both ZDF groups were unresponsive to the
stimulatory effect of high glucose (Fig. 5D).

Islets of ZDF-i rats show alterations in expression of key
-cell genes that are minimally prevented by physical activity.
Reduction in islet insulin mRNA was observed in the ZDF-I,
with partial prevention of this being evident in the ZDF-A
group. The mRNA expressions of glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor (GLP1r), glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
polypep-tide receptor (GIPr), G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40),
MafA, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX-1),
and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were markedly downregulated
in ZDF-I islets, and physical activity did not prevent these
changes (Fig. 6). Among the tested genes, the ones that were
upregulated in ZDF-I compared with ZL-I rats were the ones
that were normalized by exercise. These included 
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1
(CPT-1),
and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-	 
co-activator-1
 (PGC-1
) (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
As in other studies using forced exercise in the ZDF rat (21,
22, 41), voluntary running prevented the development of 
diabetes despite continuing hyperphagia, obesity, and 
hyperlipid-emia. Compensatory insulin secretion was preserved by 
exercise, and, this was best characterized by enhanced insulin
secretion per islet and prevention of severe depletion of islet
insulin stores. Interestingly, islets of both ZDF-I and ZDF-A
rats had significant abnormalities in key -cell gene expression
ZUCKER DIABETIC FATTY RAT ISLET FUNCTION AND EXERCISE

as well as loss of glucose responsiveness of fatty acid oxidation
and the lipolysis arm of GL/FA cycling.
Voluntary exercise does not reverse hyperphagia and obesity
but prevents hyperglycemia in ZDF rats. Food intake and body
weight were not altered by exercise despite the greater 
exer-cise-related energy expenditure in the ZDF-A rats, which ran
an average 4.2 km/day. However, this finding is not surprising
because ZDF-A maintained glycemia below 180 mg/dl
throughout the study. Therefore, less calories from food intake
would be wasted into urine, making ZDF-A rats more 
metabolically efficient than ZDF-I rats, which had mean glycemia
250 mg/dl for most of the study. Such improvement in
metabolic efficiency via reduced glucose excretion in urine has
been reported previously (6, 41). On the other hand, there were
changes in body composition with increased skeletal muscle
weights, reduced liver mass, and a trend for EWAT depots to
be smaller (8% reduced, P  0.064) in ZDF-A compared with
ZDF-I rats. Such favorable changes in body composition have
been observed in T2D patients who are physically active (43).
At 2 wk into the intervention, ZDF-I rats were still 
normogly-cemic but had two times the insulinemia of ZDF-A rats (Fig.
2A), consistent with some lessening of IR in the physically
active rats. Other studies using homeostasis model 
assess-ment-IR and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp 
technique have reported increased insulin sensitivity in 
exercise-trained ZDF rats (23, 41). Although not the focus of the present

E259ZUCKER
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00360.2011 • www.ajpendo.org
experiment, we expect that insulin sensitivity was improved in
physically active ZDF rats.
Voluntary exercise is not causing elevation of stress
hormones. All but two exercise studies (23, 44) in male ZDF
rats have used forced treadmill running or swimming. During
forced exercise, often conducted during the lights-on cycle,
animals experience severe psychological stress and disruption
of the normal circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis (12). In addition to beneficial adaptations,
such as increased oxidative capacity and improved insulin
sensitivity, forced treadmill running is associated with 
unwanted physiological adaptations indicative of chronic stress
(29). Importantly, glucose homeostasis itself can be affected by
nonexercise forms of stress (19). Hence, ZDF rats bathing in 5
cm of water and serving as a sham control group to a 
swimming group of rats had increased plasma corticosterone 
concentrations, which was associated with delayed onset of 
postprandial hyperglycemia (22). Such results stemming from
forced swimming exercise make the interpretation of the data
ambiguous.
In the present study, we measured plasma corticosterone
concentrations in the morning at times of rest for the rats (basal
corticosterone) rather than during times of exercise, and these
were not altered by voluntary running in ZDF rats. Moreover,
plasma ACTH was decreased in physically active ZDF rats in
the face of similar plasma corticosterone concentrations 
compared with inactive ZDF rats. This may be due to an enhanced
sensitivity of the adrenal glands to ACTH, as suggested by
Fediuc et al. (12) based on data obtained from Sprague-Dawley
rats that had been trained by voluntary running for 5 wk.
Alternatively, increased conversion of 11-dehydrocorticoster-
one to corticosterone through the action of 11-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase 1 (11-HSD1) dehydrogenase activity may
have contributed to the maintenance of plasma corticosterone.
However, Campbell et al. (3) assayed 11-HSD1 
dehydrogenase protein content in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues of
ZDF rats and found that voluntary exercise did not affect it.
Voluntary running is intuitively a more physiological exercise
model, since the animals are not forcibly exercised through
stressful means and are permitted to exercise at the intensity,
duration, and frequency patterns that they choose during their
normal awake time at night. Nonetheless, a careful study
directly comparing the response of the HPA axis to voluntary
wheel running and forced treadmill exercise training would be
helpful.
Voluntary exercise preserves capacity of ZDF islets to 
compensate for IR. Insulin secretion to oral glucose was markedly
enhanced in ZDF-A compared with both ZDF-I and ZL-I rats.
This was confirmed in the isolated islet studies. GSIS in the
presence or absence of fatty acids and expressed per islet was
higher in ZDF-A islets compared with the ZL-I and ZDF-I
islets. Although GSIS was similar at 8 mmol/l in ZDF-I and
ZL-I islets, compensatory enhanced secretion as seen in
ZDF-A islets was not evident in ZDF-I islets, and there was a
complete failure of further enhancement of secretion at 16
mmol/l glucose in the absence or presence of fatty acids.
Although the results can only be considered preliminary, the
effect of exercise to increase active GLP-1 levels in the ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats in this study could potentially be
important in the mechanisms by which exercise preserves
insulin secretion in ZDF rats.
E260
ZDF islet failure or islet -cell failure? GSIS was expressed
in three different ways, per islet, per islet protein content, and
per islet total insulin content, as shown in Fig. 4, C-E. Almost
all previous studies of GSIS in isolated islets of ZDF rats have
expressed their results as insulin release per islet only (13, 14,
16, 24, 34, 47, 51, 52, 55). GSIS expressed per islet reflects
both the effects of islet size and function on insulin secretion,
and this was clearly enhanced in islets of the ZDF-A rats
compared with the islets of both the ZL-I and ZDF-I rat groups.
Secretion per islet, however, is not a good measure of 
individual islet -cell function, particularly if islet size is very 
different between groups. Islet size was approximately fourfold
greater in ZDF-I and ZDF-A islets compared with ZL-I islets.
Correcting GSIS for islet protein content and for islet total
insulin content should give closer approximations to individual
-cell function.
Correcting for islet protein
content showed improved 
function in ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I islets, but
not to the same
level of GSIS of ZL-I islets. The islet protein content
measure-
ment, however, is
a reflection of not only -cells but all cells
in the islet. Insulin is present only in -cells and, for this
reason, correcting for islet insulin content may be the best
measure of individual -cell function depending on whether
insulin content per individual -cell is equivalent across
groups. Interestingly, correcting GSIS for islet total insulin
content showed no deficiencies in either the ZDF-I or ZDF-A
islets, and the ZDF-A islets were not better than the ZDF-I
islets. Although not significant, there appeared to be a left shift
in glucose dependency for insulin secretion in ZDF-I islets.
Also, insulin secretion in response to KCl was greatest in the
ZFD-I islets when insulin secretion was expressed in this way.
Only one previous study reported insulin secretion based on the
fraction of the islet insulin content released in ZDF rats (36).
They observed enhanced basal secretion and reduced GSIS.
Altogether these results suggest that increased islet size
plays a major role in islet compensation for IR in the ZDF-A
rat, since GSIS per islet protein was still mildly impaired in

individual islet -cell function is impaired in ZDF-I islets and
whether this is altered by exercise. To determine this, it would
be necessary to have accurate assessment of the proportion of
-cells per islet.
Morphological studies of sedentary ZDF rat islets have
previously shown them to be enlarged with increased 
nonen-docrine cells and fibrosis with reduced immunostaining for
insulin (21, 22, 41). The latter appears to be a consequence of
both reduced -cells per islet area and reduced intensity of
insulin staining. Furthermore, these features are reversed by
exercise (21, 22, 41). The 86% reduction in islet insulin content
in the current study is consistent with these findings and those
of Zhou and colleagues (59) who showed that insulin content
expressed per islet DNA in ZDF rats was only 30% of that in
ZL rat islets. Thus, the poor GSIS of ZDF-I islets is likely to
be contributed to by both reduced -cells per islet and reduced
individual -cell insulin stores, and both are at least partly
improved by exercise. This view of the ZDF rat model is of
significance for diabetes research since it is widely used.
The finding that insulin secretion corrected for total insulin
content is not impaired suggests that the main defect in ZDF rat
islets is not its secretory machinery or glucose signaling per se.
However, the failure of further enhancement of insulin 
secretion at the highest glucose concentration in the presence or
absence of fatty acids suggests some defects in 
nutrient-secretion coupling mechanisms.
Unclear in the current data is whether the loss of insulin
stores is an early pathogenic factor in the -cell failure of
ZDF-I rats or a consequence of progressive -cell damage due
to glucolipotoxic effects after early -cell failure from other
causes. In the ZF-Px rat model, we also showed marked loss of
pancreatic insulin content when the rats were moderately
hyperglycemic (11), such that the depletion of insulin stores is
not an exclusive feature of the ZDF rat. It is generally accepted
that -cell degranulation is a common late pathogenic factor in
T2D (56). In favor of depletion of insulin stores as being a
more primary factor is a known insulin-promoter mutation
specific to the ZDF rat (15), whereas both the ZDF and ZF
animals show a mutated leptin receptor gene.
Role of altered lipid partitioning and GL/FA cycling in ZDF
rats. Fatty acid oxidation at low glucose and the lipolysis arm
of GL/FA cycling at high glucose, both proposed as 
mechanisms for cellular lipid detoxification (33), were reduced in
ZDF-I compared with ZL-I rats. Furthermore, glucose 
responsiveness of both processes was lost. Importantly, these defects
were also present in the ZDF-A rats, such that exercise did not
prevent them. These defects in islet fatty acid partitioning,
therefore, are not induced by hyperglycemia but appear as
early defects in ZDF islets such that they could underlie islet
susceptibility in this model. Consistent with these findings, we
observed a lack of glucose regulation of islet fatty acid 
oxidation and lipolysis in ZDF rat islets at the diabetes transition
phase (9 wk of age) (53). We also found defective glucose
responsiveness of GL/FA cycling in islets of hyperglycemic
diet-induced obese mice (C57Bl6) but enhanced GL/FA 
cycling and fat oxidation at elevated glucose in compensating ZF
rat islets (32). Thus, glucose responsiveness of islet lipid
partitioning pathways appears to be robust in the ZF rat
(diabetes resistant) but poor in the ZDF rat strain and high-fat-
fed C57Bl6 mice (both diabetes prone).

The reduced fatty acid oxidation at low and intermediate
glucose concentrations and the reduced lipolysis at high 
glucose are consistent with the increased accumulation of 
intra-cellular NEFA and neutral esterified lipids in ZDF-I islets. A
consequence is a greater pool of lipid signaling molecules,
such as DAG, to cope with the increased demand of insulin
secretion, but this dysregulation could also result in 
lipotoxicity. In particular, the lack of glucose-stimulated lipolysis in
ZDF islets may contribute to an imbalance between fat 
esterification and lipolysis. The consequent glucolipotoxicity in this
model could cause both a reduction in the expression of the
insulin gene (40) as well as other key -cell genes and lead to
-cell apoptosis.
Physical activity and -cell gene expression. Reduced
mRNA expression of MafA, PDX-1, insulin, GPR40, GLP1r,
GIPr, and PC in islets from ZDF-I compared with islets from
ZL-I rats suggests a state of moderate “dedifferentiation”
(reduced expression of key genes that characterize a normal
-cell phenotype) of -cells in diabetic rats. Surprisingly,
except for the insulin gene, physical activity did not reverse
these modifications, but this is not inconsistent with some mild
impairment of -cell function in ZDF-A islets compared with
ZL-I islets when the analysis is corrected for protein. In
E262
contrast, pancreatectomized female Sprague-Dawley rats fed a
high-fat diet showed increased islet PDX-1 mRNA expression
and improved -cell function following 8 wk of exercise
training (4). However, the ZDF rat does not seem to fit with the
theory proposing that -cell dedifferentiation plays
causal role in -cell dysfunction and failure (7, 17, 56). We
speculate that the reduced expression of these genes is a marker
of islet stress and to some degree has a protective role to
prevent excessive insulin biosynthesis/secretion and associated
ER stress (45) causing cell death. The enhanced expression of
the SCD-1, CPT-1, and PGC-1
 genes in diabetic ZDF-I rat
islets could be attempts by the -cell to protect themselves in
the face of hyperglycemia favoring -cell lipodetoxification by
simultaneously enhancing both fat oxidation (CPT-1 and 
PGC-1
) and diverting fatty acids to safe TG deposition (SCD-1)
rather than to the accumulation of complex lipids such as
ceramides that are more toxic to the cell (5, 31, 38). Fatty acid
oxidation, however, was not increased in the hyperglycaemic
ZDF-I rats, suggesting upregulation of these genes was not an
effective compensation.
Role of exercising muscle in -cell protection. A key 
question arises as to how physical activity preserves insulin stores
and -cell function. A possible explanation is that the 
over-nourished but
physically active male ZDF-A
rats avoided
hyperglycemia by improving insulin sensitivity, as suggested
by the diminutions in weekly plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations. Direct demonstration of improved whole body
insulin sensitivity in trained ZDF rats was shown by Pold et al.
(41) using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique.
Alternatively, exercise can enhance glucose partitioning to
exercising muscle by activating AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK)
in muscle, which is known to promote glucose
disposal independently of insulin (2, 30). Because voluntary
running ZDF rats spent 300 min/night exercising, this would
reduce the insulin required
to compensate for IR, as well as
favor lower glycemia. The finding of an increased marker of
muscle oxidative capacity in ZFD-A rats is in keeping with a
role for enhanced muscle glucose usage being important. With
respect
to the potential role of AMPK activation, it is 
interesting to note that forced treadmill running in ZDF rats led to
upregulation of AMPK
1 subunit in red gastrocnemius (41)
and that AICAR (58) and thiazolidinediones (50), both known
to affect AMPK activity, also prevent diabetes in ZDF rats.
In conclusion, the ZDF rat, unlike the ZF rat, has islets
that are susceptible to failure in the face of nutrient 
overload. The underlying -cell susceptibility factor(s) in ZDF
rats is unknown, but the results of this study provide
evidence that dysregulation of -cell lipid metabolism is an
attractive possibility, since exercise could not reverse this
and also because the defect is already apparent at the
diabetes transition phase at 9 wk of age (53) and thus is
independent of hyperglycemia. Another possibility is the
mutation in the insulin promoter in ZDF rats (15) that
combines with glucolipotoxicity-induced reduction in 
insulin gene expression (40). Severe depletion of islet insulin
stores due to either loss of islet -cells or reduced insulin
content per -cell, but most likely both, is a major 
contributor to insulin secretion failure in this rodent model of
obesity-associated T2D, preventable by voluntary running.

DISCUSSION
As in other studies using forced exercise in the ZDF rat (21,
22, 41), voluntary running prevented the development of 
diabetes despite continuing hyperphagia, obesity, and 
hyperlipid-emia. Compensatory insulin secretion was preserved by 
exercise, and, this was best characterized by enhanced insulin
secretion per islet and prevention of severe depletion of islet
insulin stores. Interestingly, islets of both ZDF-I and ZDF-A
rats had significant abnormalities in key -cell gene expression

as well as loss of glucose responsiveness of fatty acid oxidation
and the lipolysis arm of GL/FA cycling.
Voluntary exercise does not reverse hyperphagia and obesity
but prevents hyperglycemia in ZDF rats. Food intake and body
weight were not altered by exercise despite the greater 
exer-cise-related energy expenditure in the ZDF-A rats, which ran
an average 4.2 km/day. However, this finding is not surprising
because ZDF-A maintained glycemia below 180 mg/dl
throughout the study. Therefore, less calories from food intake
would be wasted into urine, making ZDF-A rats more 
metabolically efficient than ZDF-I rats, which had mean glycemia
250 mg/dl for most of the study. Such improvement in
metabolic efficiency via reduced glucose excretion in urine has
been reported previously (6, 41). On the other hand, there were
changes in body composition with increased skeletal muscle
weights, reduced liver mass, and a trend for EWAT depots to
be smaller (8% reduced, P  0.064) in ZDF-A compared with
ZDF-I rats. Such favorable changes in body composition have
been observed in T2D patients who are physically active (43).
At 2 wk into the intervention, ZDF-I rats were still 
normogly-cemic but had two times the insulinemia of ZDF-A rats (Fig.
2A), consistent with some lessening of IR in the physically
active rats. Other studies using homeostasis model 
assess-ment-IR and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp 
technique have reported increased insulin sensitivity in 
exercise-trained ZDF rats (23, 41). Although not the focus of the present
DIABETIC FATTY RAT ISLET FUNCTION AND EXERCISE
E259ZUCKER
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00360.2011 • www.ajpendo.org
experiment, we expect that insulin sensitivity was improved in
physically active ZDF rats.
Voluntary exercise is not causing elevation of stress
hormones. All but two exercise studies (23, 44) in male ZDF
rats have used forced treadmill running or swimming. During
forced exercise, often conducted during the lights-on cycle,
animals experience severe psychological stress and disruption
of the normal circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis (12). In addition to beneficial adaptations,
such as increased oxidative capacity and improved insulin
sensitivity, forced treadmill running is associated with 
unwanted physiological adaptations indicative of chronic stress
(29). Importantly, glucose homeostasis itself can be affected by
nonexercise forms of stress (19). Hence, ZDF rats bathing in 5
cm of water and serving as a sham control group to a 
swimming group of rats had increased plasma corticosterone 
concentrations, which was associated with delayed onset of 
postprandial hyperglycemia (22). Such results stemming from
forced swimming exercise make the interpretation of the data
ambiguous.
In the present study, we measured plasma corticosterone
concentrations in the morning at times of rest for the rats (basal
corticosterone) rather than during times of exercise, and these
were not altered by voluntary running in ZDF rats. Moreover,
plasma ACTH was decreased in physically active ZDF rats in
the face of similar plasma corticosterone concentrations 
compared with inactive ZDF rats. This may be due to an enhanced
sensitivity of the adrenal glands to ACTH, as suggested by
Fediuc et al. (12) based on data obtained from Sprague-Dawley
rats that had been trained by voluntary running for 5 wk.
Alternatively, increased conversion of 11-dehydrocorticoster-
one to corticosterone through the action of 11-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase 1 (11-HSD1) dehydrogenase activity may
have contributed to the maintenance of plasma corticosterone.
However, Campbell et al. (3) assayed 11-HSD1 
dehydrogenase protein content in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues of
ZDF rats and found that voluntary exercise did not affect it.
Voluntary running is intuitively a more physiological exercise
model, since the animals are not forcibly exercised through
stressful means and are permitted to exercise at the intensity,
duration, and frequency patterns that they choose during their
normal awake time at night. Nonetheless, a careful study
directly comparing the response of the HPA axis to voluntary
wheel running and forced treadmill exercise training would be
helpful.
Voluntary exercise preserves capacity of ZDF islets to 
compensate for IR. Insulin secretion to oral glucose was markedly
enhanced in ZDF-A compared with both ZDF-I and ZL-I rats.
This was confirmed in the isolated islet studies. GSIS in the
presence or absence of fatty acids and expressed per islet was
higher in ZDF-A islets compared with the ZL-I and ZDF-I
islets. Although GSIS was similar at 8 mmol/l in ZDF-I and
ZL-I islets, compensatory enhanced secretion as seen in
ZDF-A islets was not evident in ZDF-I islets, and there was a
complete failure of further enhancement of secretion at 16
mmol/l glucose in the absence or presence of fatty acids.
Although the results can only be considered preliminary, the
effect of exercise to increase active GLP-1 levels in the ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats in this study could potentially be
important in the mechanisms by which exercise preserves
insulin secretion in ZDF rats.
E260
ZDF islet failure or islet -cell failure? GSIS was expressed
in three different ways, per islet, per islet protein content, and
per islet total insulin content, as shown in Fig. 4, C-E. Almost
all previous studies of GSIS in isolated islets of ZDF rats have
expressed their results as insulin release per islet only (13, 14,
16, 24, 34, 47, 51, 52, 55). GSIS expressed per islet reflects
both the effects of islet size and function on insulin secretion,
and this was clearly enhanced in islets of the ZDF-A rats
compared with the islets of both the ZL-I and ZDF-I rat groups.
Secretion per islet, however, is not a good measure of 
individual islet -cell function, particularly if islet size is very 
different between groups. Islet size was approximately fourfold
greater in ZDF-I and ZDF-A islets compared with ZL-I islets.
Correcting GSIS for islet protein content and for islet total
insulin content should give closer approximations to individual
-cell function.
Correcting for islet protein
content showed improved 
function in ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I islets, but
not to the same
level of GSIS of ZL-I islets. The islet protein content
measure-
ment, however, is
a reflection of not only -cells but all cells
in the islet. Insulin is present only in -cells and, for this
reason, correcting for islet insulin content may be the best
measure of individual -cell function depending on whether
insulin content per individual -cell is equivalent across
groups. Interestingly, correcting GSIS for islet total insulin
content showed no deficiencies in either the ZDF-I or ZDF-A
islets, and the ZDF-A islets were not better than the ZDF-I
islets. Although not significant, there appeared to be a left shift
in glucose dependency for insulin secretion in ZDF-I islets.
Also, insulin secretion in response to KCl was greatest in the
ZFD-I islets when insulin secretion was expressed in this way.
Only one previous study reported insulin secretion based on the
fraction of the islet insulin content released in ZDF rats (36).
They observed enhanced basal secretion and reduced GSIS.
Altogether these results suggest that increased islet size
plays a major role in islet compensation for IR in the ZDF-A
rat, since GSIS per islet protein was still mildly impaired in
ZDF-A islets. Unclear from this data, however, is whether
ZUCKER DIABETIC FATTY RAT ISLET FUNCTION AND EXERCISE
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00360.2011 • www.ajpendo.org
individual islet -cell function is impaired in ZDF-I islets and
whether this is altered by exercise. To determine this, it would
be necessary to have accurate assessment of the proportion of
-cells per islet.
Morphological studies of sedentary ZDF rat islets have
previously shown them to be enlarged with increased 
nonen-docrine cells and fibrosis with reduced immunostaining for
insulin (21, 22, 41). The latter appears to be a consequence of
both reduced -cells per islet area and reduced intensity of
insulin staining. Furthermore, these features are reversed by
exercise (21, 22, 41). The 86% reduction in islet insulin content
in the current study is consistent with these findings and those
of Zhou and colleagues (59) who showed that insulin content
expressed per islet DNA in ZDF rats was only 30% of that in
ZL rat islets. Thus, the poor GSIS of ZDF-I islets is likely to
be contributed to by both reduced -cells per islet and reduced
individual -cell insulin stores, and both are at least partly
improved by exercise. This view of the ZDF rat model is of
significance for diabetes research since it is widely used.
The finding that insulin secretion corrected for total insulin
content is not impaired suggests that the main defect in ZDF rat
islets is not its secretory machinery or glucose signaling per se.
However, the failure of further enhancement of insulin 
secretion at the highest glucose concentration in the presence or
absence of fatty acids suggests some defects in 
nutrient-secretion coupling mechanisms.
Unclear in the current data is whether the loss of insulin
stores is an early pathogenic factor in the -cell failure of
ZDF-I rats or a consequence of progressive -cell damage due
to glucolipotoxic effects after early -cell failure from other
causes. In the ZF-Px rat model, we also showed marked loss of
pancreatic insulin content when the rats were moderately
hyperglycemic (11), such that the depletion of insulin stores is
not an exclusive feature of the ZDF rat. It is generally accepted
that -cell degranulation is a common late pathogenic factor in
T2D (56). In favor of depletion of insulin stores as being a
more primary factor is a known insulin-promoter mutation
specific to the ZDF rat (15), whereas both the ZDF and ZF
animals show a mutated leptin receptor gene.
Role of altered lipid partitioning and GL/FA cycling in ZDF
rats. Fatty acid oxidation at low glucose and the lipolysis arm
of GL/FA cycling at high glucose, both proposed as 
mechanisms for cellular lipid detoxification (33), were reduced in
ZDF-I compared with ZL-I rats. Furthermore, glucose 
responsiveness of both processes was lost. Importantly, these defects
were also present in the ZDF-A rats, such that exercise did not
prevent them. These defects in islet fatty acid partitioning,
therefore, are not induced by hyperglycemia but appear as
early defects in ZDF islets such that they could underlie islet
susceptibility in this model. Consistent with these findings, we
observed a lack of glucose regulation of islet fatty acid 
oxidation and lipolysis in ZDF rat islets at the diabetes transition
phase (9 wk of age) (53). We also found defective glucose
responsiveness of GL/FA cycling in islets of hyperglycemic
diet-induced obese mice (C57Bl6) but enhanced GL/FA 
cycling and fat oxidation at elevated glucose in compensating ZF
rat islets (32). Thus, glucose responsiveness of islet lipid
partitioning pathways appears to be robust in the ZF rat
(diabetes resistant) but poor in the ZDF rat strain and high-fat-
fed C57Bl6 mice (both diabetes prone).

The reduced fatty acid oxidation at low and intermediate
glucose concentrations and the reduced lipolysis at high 
glucose are consistent with the increased accumulation of 
intra-cellular NEFA and neutral esterified lipids in ZDF-I islets. A
consequence is a greater pool of lipid signaling molecules,
such as DAG, to cope with the increased demand of insulin
secretion, but this dysregulation could also result in 
lipotoxicity. In particular, the lack of glucose-stimulated lipolysis in
ZDF islets may contribute to an imbalance between fat 
esterification and lipolysis. The consequent glucolipotoxicity in this
model could cause both a reduction in the expression of the
insulin gene (40) as well as other key -cell genes and lead to
-cell apoptosis.
Physical activity and -cell gene expression. Reduced
mRNA expression of MafA, PDX-1, insulin, GPR40, GLP1r,
GIPr, and PC in islets from ZDF-I compared with islets from
ZL-I rats suggests a state of moderate “dedifferentiation”
(reduced expression of key genes that characterize a normal
-cell phenotype) of -cells in diabetic rats. Surprisingly,
except for the insulin gene, physical activity did not reverse
these modifications, but this is not inconsistent with some mild
impairment of -cell function in ZDF-A islets compared with
ZL-I islets when the analysis is corrected for protein. In
E262
contrast, pancreatectomized female Sprague-Dawley rats fed a
high-fat diet showed increased islet PDX-1 mRNA expression
and improved -cell function following 8 wk of exercise
training (4). However, the ZDF rat does not seem to fit with the
theory proposing that -cell dedifferentiation plays
causal role in -cell dysfunction and failure (7, 17, 56). We
speculate that the reduced expression of these genes is a marker
of islet stress and to some degree has a protective role to
prevent excessive insulin biosynthesis/secretion and associated
ER stress (45) causing cell death. The enhanced expression of
the SCD-1, CPT-1, and PGC-1
 genes in diabetic ZDF-I rat
islets could be attempts by the -cell to protect themselves in
the face of hyperglycemia favoring -cell lipodetoxification by
simultaneously enhancing both fat oxidation (CPT-1 and 
PGC-1
) and diverting fatty acids to safe TG deposition (SCD-1)
rather than to the accumulation of complex lipids such as
ceramides that are more toxic to the cell (5, 31, 38). Fatty acid
oxidation, however, was not increased in the hyperglycaemic
ZDF-I rats, suggesting upregulation of these genes was not an
effective compensation.
Role of exercising muscle in -cell protection. A key 
question arises as to how physical activity preserves insulin stores
and -cell function. A possible explanation is that the 
over-nourished but
physically active male ZDF-A
rats avoided
hyperglycemia by improving insulin sensitivity, as suggested
by the diminutions in weekly plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations. Direct demonstration of improved whole body
insulin sensitivity in trained ZDF rats was shown by Pold et al.
(41) using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique.
Alternatively, exercise can enhance glucose partitioning to
exercising muscle by activating AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK)
in muscle, which is known to promote glucose
disposal independently of insulin (2, 30). Because voluntary
running ZDF rats spent 300 min/night exercising, this would
reduce the insulin required
to compensate for IR, as well as
favor lower glycemia. The finding of an increased marker of
muscle oxidative capacity in ZFD-A rats is in keeping with a
role for enhanced muscle glucose usage being important. With
respect
to the potential role of AMPK activation, it is 
interesting to note that forced treadmill running in ZDF rats led to
upregulation of AMPK
1 subunit in red gastrocnemius (41)
and that AICAR (58) and thiazolidinediones (50), both known
to affect AMPK activity, also prevent diabetes in ZDF rats.
In conclusion, the ZDF rat, unlike the ZF rat, has islets
that are susceptible to failure in the face of nutrient 
overload. The underlying -cell susceptibility factor(s) in ZDF
rats is unknown, but the results of this study provide
evidence that dysregulation of -cell lipid metabolism is an
attractive possibility, since exercise could not reverse this
and also because the defect is already apparent at the
diabetes transition phase at 9 wk of age (53) and thus is
independent of hyperglycemia. Another possibility is the
mutation in the insulin promoter in ZDF rats (15) that
combines with glucolipotoxicity-induced reduction in 
insulin gene expression (40). Severe depletion of islet insulin
stores due to either loss of islet -cells or reduced insulin
content per -cell, but most likely both, is a major 
contributor to insulin secretion failure in this rodent model of
obesity-associated T2D, preventable by voluntary running.

RESULTS
Body weight, food intake, and organ weights. ZDF-A rats
ran an average of 4.2 km/day over the 6 wk (Fig. 1A).
Differences in food intake or body weight were not observed
between ZDF-A and ZDF-I rats (Fig. 1, B and C). Both ZDF
groups remained markedly obese and hyperphagic compared
E256
ZUCKER DIABETIC FATTY RAT ISLET FUNCTION AND EXERCISE
with the ZL-I rats. There were changes, however, in body
composition between the ZDF rat groups at the end of the study
(Table 1). Plantaris and soleus muscles were heavier in ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats, while the heart followed this
tendency (P  0.052) and liver weight was reduced in ZDF-A
rats. EWAT tended to weigh less in ZDF-A compared with
ZDF-I rats (P 0.064) but was3.5-fold heavier than in ZL-I
rats.
Physical activity prevents the development of diabetes but
not severe dyslipidemia in ZDF rats. At 6 wk of age, ZDF-I
rats were normoglycemic and hypersinsulinemic. They became
diabetic by 9-10 wk of age while hyperinsulinemia 
progressively decreased past that age (Fig. 2, A and B). Voluntary
exercise prevented diabetes (Fig. 2A). The ZDF-A rats were
markedly hyperinsulinemic compared with the ZL-I rats, but
the levels in the first 2 wk of intervention were less than half

that required by the ZDF-I rats (Fig. 2B). While physical
activity prevented diabetes, it had no effect on the severe
hypertriglyceridemia of ZDF rats (Table 2). Fed-state plasma
active GLP-1 concentrations were higher in ZDF-A (7.8  1.2
pM) compared with ZL-I (4.6 0.6 pM; P 0.02) and tended
to be higher than ZDF-I (5.1  0.4 pM; P  0.06).
Voluntary running reduced hyperactivation of stress hormones.
Corticosterone levels were not increased in the ZDF-A compared
with ZDF-I rats; rather, there was a trend for them to fall in the
voluntary exercising group in the last few weeks of the 
intervention period (significantly reduced at week 4 of the 
interven-tion) (Fig. 2C). Plasma ACTH concentrations from samples
collected upon death were markedly lower in the ZDF-A
compared with ZDF-I rats (Fig. 2D).
Voluntary exercise improves glucose tolerance through
maintenance of the glucose-stimulated insulin response. The
ZDF-I rats had markedly impaired glucose intolerance
(Fig. 3A). Voluntary running in the ZDF rats improved glucose
tolerance to levels similar to those seen in ZL-I rats (Fig. 3, A
and C). Furthermore, ZDF-A rats showed an increase in the
plasma insulin response compared with ZDF-I rats (Fig. 3B).
Improved pancreatic islet -cell function in ZDF-A vs. ZDF-I
rats was also evident from the insulinogenic index (Fig. 3E).
The insulin response of ZDF-A rats was markedly higher than
that of the ZL-I rats (Fig. 3, B and D).
Elevated nonislet tissue glycogen and TG contents are not
lowered by exercise in ZDF rats, but skeletal muscle 
mitochondrial oxidative capacity is increased. Red and white 
gastrocnemius muscle glycogen levels were not affected by 6 wk of
voluntary running, being similar across all three rat groups
(data not shown). Liver glycogen content was lower in ZL-I
rats (130 9 mol/g; P 0.01) compared with both ZDF rats
(ZDF-A: 273  13 and ZDF-I: 261  13 mol/g). Liver TG
content was also lower in ZL-I rats compared with ZDF rats
(ZL-I: 8.0  0.4 mg/g vs. ZDF-A: 22.5  1.5 and ZDF-I:
21.1  1.0 mg/g; P  0.05). Higher liver glycogen and TG
contents observed in the ZDF rats were not affected by 
physical activity. However, muscle cytochrome oxidase activity, an
index of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, was increased in the
gastrocnemius in ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I rats (respec-
tively, 0.318  0.051 and 0.168  0.011 U/g in red 
gastrocnemius; P  0.05; 0.086  0.021 and 0.036  0.003 U/g in
white gastrocnemius; P  0.059).
Severe depletion of islet insulin stores in ZDF-i rats is
prevented by physical activity. Islets from ZDF-I rats were four
times larger than those of ZL-I rats based on protein content
with no difference in size evident between ZDF-I and ZDF-A
rats (Fig. 4A). Importantly, when insulin content was 
normalized to protein content, islets from ZDF-I rats showed an 86%

reduction compared with ZL-I islets. In contrast, partial but
significant preservation of the insulin stores was observed in
ZDF-A compared with ZDF-I islets (Fig. 4B).
Physical activity prevents loss of compensatory insulin 
hy-persecretion to glucose and palmitate in isolated islets from
ZDF rats. Insulin secretion in control ZL-I islets, expressed per
islet (Fig. 4C), was increased at intermediate (8 mmol/l) and
further increased at high (16 mmol/l) glucose concentrations
with potentiation by palmitate. Insulin secretion in ZDF-I islets
was similar to ZL-I islets at 8 mmol/l glucose with or without
palmitate, but further increases in secretion at 16 mmol/l
glucose
were not seen either in the presence or absence of
palmitate (Fig. 4C). In
contrast, islets from physically active
ZDF-A
rats showed an enhanced glucose and fatty 
acid-potentiated insulin secretion compared with ZL-I rats at both 8
and 16 mmol/l glucose (Fig. 4C). No significant effect of KCl
on insulin secretion was observed between the three groups
(Fig. 4C). Interestingly, if insulin secretion was normalized per
islet protein content (Fig. 4D), the ZL-I islets were found to
have significantly better insulin secretion in response to 16
mmol/l glucose in the presence or absence of palmitate than
both ZDF-I and ZDF-A islets. Expressed this way, ZDF-A
islets still had improved GSIS compared with ZDF-I islets,
although the difference did not reach statistical significance
(Fig. 4D). When GSIS was expressed as a percentage of
corrected total islet insulin content (sum of insulin content
measured at the end of the incubation period and the secreted
insulin within that period), the impairment of GSIS in ZDF-I

islets was no longer evident and was actually increased 
compared with ZL-I islets in response to KCl at 3 mmol/l glucose
(Fig. 4E).
Glycerolipid cycling and fatty acid oxidation in islets from
ZDF rats is unresponsive to glucose and is not influenced by
physical activity. All islet fatty acid metabolism data have been
corrected for islet protein content. The inhibitory effect of high
glucose concentrations on fatty acid oxidation was observed in
ZL-I rat islets (Fig. 5A). However, in both ZDF-I and ZDF-A,
fatty acid oxidation was reduced at both 3 and 8 mmol/l
compared with ZL-I islets. In addition, no inhibitory effect of
high glucose on islet fatty acid oxidation was observed in the
ZDF groups (Fig. 5A). After 16 h incubation (equilibrium
phase), net exogenous palmitate accumulation into intracellular
NEFAs was increased by 60-70% in islets of the ZDF-I and
ZDF-A rats compared with ZL-I islets (P  0.05; 2-way
ANOVA: group effect) (Fig. 5B). Net exogenous palmitate
esterification into total glycerolipids (monoacylglycerol
DAG TG) was increased by65-70% in islets of both ZDF
rat groups compared with ZL-I islets (P  0.05; 2-way
ANOVA, group effect) (Fig. 5C). Lipolysis of islet 
glycerolipids, as assessed by measurement of glycerol release, was
increased by 85% at 16 compared with 3 mmol/l glucose in
islets from ZL-I rats (Fig. 5D). Basal lipolysis was not different
between islets of the three rat groups, but, in contrast to ZL-I
islets, islets of both ZDF groups were unresponsive to the
stimulatory effect of high glucose (Fig. 5D).

Islets of ZDF-i rats show alterations in expression of key
-cell genes that are minimally prevented by physical activity.
Reduction in islet insulin mRNA was observed in the ZDF-I,
with partial prevention of this being evident in the ZDF-A
group. The mRNA expressions of glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor (GLP1r), glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
polypep-tide receptor (GIPr), G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40),
MafA, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX-1),
and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were markedly downregulated
in ZDF-I islets, and physical activity did not prevent these
changes (Fig. 6). Among the tested genes, the ones that were
upregulated in ZDF-I compared with ZL-I rats were the ones
that were normalized by exercise. These included 
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1
(CPT-1),
and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-	 
co-activator-1
 (PGC-1

improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its contribution
to preserving -cell function is uncertain. We evaluated the role of
physical activity on -cell secretory function and glycerolipid/fatty acid
(GL/FA) cycling in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Six-week-old
ZDF rats engaged in voluntary running for 6 wk (ZDF-A). Inactive
Zucker lean and ZDF (ZDF-I) rats served as controls. ZDF-I rats
displayed progressive hyperglycemia with -cell failure evidenced by
falling insulinemia and reduced insulin secretion to oral glucose. Isolated
ZDF-I rat islets showed reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
expressed per islet and per islet protein. They were also characterized by
loss of the glucose regulation of fatty acid oxidation and GL/FA cycling,
reduced
mRNA expression of key -cell genes, and severe reduction of
insulin stores. Physical activity prevented diabetes in ZDF rats through
sustaining -cell compensation to insulin resistance shown in vivo and in
vitro. Surprisingly, ZDF-A islets had persistent defects in fatty acid
oxidation, GL/FA cycling, and -cell gene expression. ZDF-A islets,
however, had preserved islet insulin mRNA and insulin stores compared
with ZDF-I rats. Physical activity did not prevent hyperphagia, 
dyslipidemia, or obesity in ZDF rats. In conclusion, islets of ZDF rats have a
susceptibility to failure that is possibly due to altered -cell fatty acid
metabolism. Depletion of pancreatic islet insulin stores is a major 
contributor to islet failure in this T2D model, preventable by physical
activity.

INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) is a predisposing factor for the 
development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, it must be 
combined with failure of -cell compensation for IR for T2D to
occur (18, 42). Diet and exercise programs can reduce T2D
development in humans with impaired glucose tolerance (35,
54). Thus, it is likely that the exercise interventions prevent
islet -cell failure (18, 42). Despite the abundant literature
supporting the beneficial effects of exercise on insulin action
(30), much less is known about the effects of exercise on -cell
function. In young individuals, exercise training decreased
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (8, 20, 28). Trained

weight to obese subjects also demonstrated a lower acute
insulin response during an intravenous glucose tolerance test
(GTT) (48). These results most probably reflect lower insulin
requirement due to improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore,
Dela and Stallknecht (9) demonstrated that 12 wk of endurance
exercise training did not increase GSIS in first-degree offspring
of T2D patients. On the other hand, these same authors showed
that diabetic subjects with good residual insulin secretory
capacity had increased GSIS following endurance training,
whereas those with low residual secretory capacity did not
improve upon training (10). Of note, Slentz et al. (48), using
the disposition index as a reflection of -cell function, 
suggested that the latter is improved by moderate-intensity 
exercise training. All together, the evidence suggests that the health
status of subjects and methodologies employed to study -cell
function are key parameters that influenced the outcome of
those studies.
The Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat is a severely 
insulin-resistant genetic model of obesity-related T2D. Unlike the
Zucker fatty (ZF) rat that is able to sustain -cell compensation
for IR, the ZDF rat is prone to -cell failure. Exercise prevents
diabetes in this animal model (6, 21, 22, 41, 49). Pold et al. (41)
showed that treadmill-trained ZDF rats did not develop 
hyperglycemia. In that study, exercise improved peripheral and
hepatic insulin action and islet morphology (41). Colombo et
al. (6), using a similar exercise protocol, reported that training
did not markedly influence gene expression in ZDF rat islets,
whereas important gene alterations were found in liver and
muscles (6). Kiraly et al. (21, 22) reported that swimming also
prevented hyperglycemia in ZDF rats, which was associated
with enhanced insulin secretion during intraperitoneal GTT
and improved islet morphology with increased -cell 
proliferation and -cell mass. However, the nature of islet 
susceptibility to failure in the ZDF rat is not known as well as the basis
of diabetes prevention by exercise.
Studies conducted in islets of the obese, but diabetes 
resistant, ZF rat, a model for -cell compensation, have shown
increased -cell mass and functional islet changes, including
enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism, processes that favor
production of nutrient-secretion coupling signals (25, 32).
Isolated ZF islets have shown enhanced palmitate 
augmentation of GSIS (32), a finding associated with enhanced 
glucose-responsive glycerolipid/fatty acid (GL/FA) cycling (32). Both
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) esterification into glycerolipids
such as triglycerides (TG) and diacylglycerols (DAG) and the
lipolysis of GLs were increased in ZF islets, particularly at
http://www.ajpendo.orgE254
increased glucose concentrations. Furthermore, lipolysis 
inhibition by the lipase inhibitor orlistat markedly reduced GSIS in
these islets (32). Thus, GL/FA cycling may provide a 
mechanism by which the -cell in ZF rat islets escapes 
glucolipotoxicity and compensates for IR without the development of
diabetes (33).
The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
biochemical basis of the effects of physical activity on islet function in
ZDF rats in which diabetes is prevented by voluntary running
in wheel cages (23, 44). Particular focus was placed on whether
preserved -cell performance in exercised ZDF rats could be
linked to the compensatory pathway of enhanced GL/FA 
cycling similar to what was observed in compensating islets of
ZF rats. We found that voluntary running markedly improved
GSIS in ZDF rat islets, but not quite to the level of function of
Zucker lean (ZL) control islets if GSIS
was expressed per islet
protein content. GL/FA cycling was abnormal in ZDF rats,
which was not normalized by physical activity. Voluntary
running had a dramatic effect on preventing depletion of islet
insulin stores in this diabetes-prone obese rat model.
