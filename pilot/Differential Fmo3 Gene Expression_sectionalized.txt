of six mice. For APAP treatment, mice were treated with APAP (400 mg/kg, ip) in 50%
propylene glycol or vehicle only (dosing volume: 5 mL/kg). Animals were sacrificed by
decapitation at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment and blood and livers were collected for
analysis. For ANIT treatment, mice were administered ANIT (50 mg/kg, po) in corn oil or
vehicle only (dosing volume: 10 mL/kg). At 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment, mice
were sacrificed by decapitation for collecting samples. For CCl4 treatment, groups of mice
were injected CCl4 (10 or 30 μL/kg, ip) in corn oil or vehicle only (dosing volume: 6
mL/kg) and 24 and 48 h after treatment, mice were sacrificed by decapitation to collect
blood and livers for analysis. For AlOH treatment, mice were administered AlOH (30 or 60
mg/kg, ip) in saline or vehicle only (dosing volume: 10 mL/kg). Animals were sacrificed by
decapitation at 6 and 24 h after treatment for sample collection and analysis. BDL liver
samples were obtained from a previously described cohort (Donepudi et al., 2012). Briefly,
sham or BDL surgery was performed under phenobarbital-induced anesthesia (65 mg/kg,
ip). The surgeries were performed at the University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy
animal facility with IACUC approval. Serum and liver were collected 10 d after surgery for
analysis.
2.2.2 Experimental Design 2-The goal of experimental design 2 was to investigate
whether Nrf2 mediateschanges in liverFmo3 gene expression. APAP was used as a model
toxicant for Nrf2 activation.Nrf2 KO mice with a C57BL/6J background werekindly
provided by Dr. Angela Slitt from the University of Rhode Island.Following overnight
fasting, male Nrf2KO mice (n=6) and their wild-type counterparts (C57BL/6J) (n=6) were
treated with APAP (400 mg/kg, ip) in 50% PG or vehicle (dosing volume: 5 mL/kg). Plasma
and livers were collected 72h after APAP treatment for analysis.
All animal studies were performed in accordance with National Institute of Health standards
and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This work was approved by the
University of Connecticut's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.3 Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Assay
Plasma or serum ALT activity was determined as a biochemical indicator of hepatocellular
injury. Infinity ALT Liquid Stable Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA)
was used to determine ALT activity. Briefly, 100 μL of reagent was added to 10 μL serum or
plasma samples, and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nmusing a
Bio-Tek Power Wave X Spectrophotometer. ALT activity (IU/L) was determined using the
molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6.3 mM−1cm−1).
2.4 Total Bile acid Assay
Total bile acids were extracted from whole liver homogenates using a t-butanol extraction
method. Briefly, livers were homogenized in extraction solution (1:1, water: tbutanol) and
bile acids extracted overnight at room temperature in the dark. Blood levels of total bile acid
and hepatic bile acid levels were measured using a spectrophotometric bile acid assay kit
(Bioquant, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol.

2.5 RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver samples using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAwas
then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an M-MLV RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Fmo3 mRNA expression was quantified by the ΔΔCT method and normalized to two
housekeeping genes, β-actin and ribosomal protein S18. Data presented were normalized to
β-actin. Primer pairs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and
are as follow: Fmo3 forward: 5′-GGA AGA GTT GGT GAA GAC CG-3′, reverse: 5′-CCC
ACA TGC TTT GAG AGG AG-3′. Amplification was performed using an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Amplification was carried out in a 20μL
reaction volume containing 8 μL diluted cDNA, Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 1μM of each primer.
2.6 Preparation of Microsomal Fraction and Western Blot Analysis
Microsomes were isolated from livers as described previously (Cashman &Hanzlik, 1981;
Rudraiah et al., 2014) and stored at −80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined
by the method of Lowry using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). For western blot analysis, microsomal proteins (10 μg) were
electrophoretically resolved using 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF-Plus
membrane (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5 % 
nonfat powdered milk in tris buffered saline containing 0.05% tween-20(TBS-T) for 8 h. A
rabbit anti-mouse Fmo3 primary antibody (GenScript USA Inc., NJ) (1:5000) was used to
detect Fmo3 with β-actin as a loading control. Blots were then incubated with HRP
conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG (1:2000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO). Protein-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescent kit (Thermo
Scientific, IL) with visualization using GeneMate blue autoradiography film (Bioexpress,
Kaysville, UT). Precision plus protein dual color standards molecular weight marker (Bio-
radLaboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to identify Fmo3 protein on the blot and
microsomal protein isolated from naïve female mouse liver was used as a positive control.
2.7 Enzyme Assay
Methimazole (MMI) metabolism was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the
rate of MMI S-oxygenation via the reaction of the oxidized product with nitro-5-
thiobenzoate (TNB) to generate 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). The incubation
mixture consisted of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.5 mM
glucose-6-phosphate, 1.5 IU/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.06 mM DTNB, 0.04
mMdithiothreitol and 100 to 150 μg/mL liver microsomes isolated from mice. Reactions
were initiated by the addition of different amounts of MMI (substrate), with a concentration
range from 1.25 to 800 μM. Incubations were done in duplicates. The disappearance of the
yellow color was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm and specific activity
(μM/min/mg) was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of NADPH (28.2
mM−1cm−1).

2.8 Statistical Analysis
Page 7
The statistical significance between groups was determined using the Student's t-test, 
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc test or two-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni'spost-hoc test. While Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different
treatment groups, ANOVA was used to compare the means of more than two treatment
groups that are normally distributed with a common variance. All statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA). Data are presented as mean ± standard error (SE), with p<0.05 considered
statistically significant.

Abstract
Flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) catalyzes metabolic reactions similar to cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase however, most metabolites of FMO3 are considered non-toxic. Recent
findings in our laboratory demonstrated Fmo3gene induction following toxic acetaminophen
(APAP) treatment in mice.The goal of this study was to evaluate Fmo3gene expression in
diverseother mouse models of hepatic oxidative stress and injury. Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2
was also investigated using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. In our studies, male C57BL/6J mice
were treated with toxic dosesof hepatotoxicants or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL, 10d).
Hepatotoxicants included APAP (400 mg/kg, 24 to 72h), alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT; 50
mg/kg, 2 to 48h), carbontetrachloride (CCl4;10 or 30 μL/kg, 24 and 48h) and allyl alcohol (AlOH;
30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24h). Because oxidative stress activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
2)-like 2 (Nrf2), additional studies investigated Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2 using Nrf2
knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. At appropriate time-points, blood and liver samples were collected for
assessment of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, plasma and hepatic bile acid
levels, as well as liver Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression. Fmo3 mRNA expression increased

significantly by 43-fold at 12h after ANIT treatment,and this increase translates to a 4-fold change
in protein levels. BDL also increased Fmo3 mRNA expression by 1899-fold, but with no change
in protein levels. Treatment of mice with CCl4decreased liver Fmo3gene expression, whileno
change in expression was detected with AlOH treatment. Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to
APAP (400 mg/kg, 72h) treatment compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, which is
evidenced by greater plasma ALT activity. Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression increased in Nrf2
KO mice after APAP treatment. Collectively, not all hepatotoxicantsthat produce oxidative stress
alter Fmo3gene expression. Along with APAP, toxic ANIT treatment in mice markedly
increasedFmo3 gene expression. While BDL increased Fmo3 mRNA expression, protein level did
not change. The discrepancy with Fmo3 induction in cholestatic models, ANIT and BDL, is not
entirely clear. Results from Nrf2 KO mice with APAP suggest that the transcriptional regulation
of Fmo3 during liver injury may not involve Nrf2.

1. Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant challenge for both drug development and
clinical care. It accounts for more than 50% of all acute liver failure cases in the U.S.
(Larson et al., 2005; W. M. Lee, 2010). Many chemicals, such as acetaminophen (APAP),
carbontetrachloride (CCl4) and allyl alcohol (AlOH) have been used to model hepatotoxicity
relevant to human exposure. Alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and bile duct ligation
(BDL) on the other hand are used to model cholestasis, a pathological condition caused by
impairment of hepatic bile flow. While ANIT produces intrahepatic cholestasis, BDL
produces extrahepatic cholestasis. With APAP and CCl4, the parent compound is
metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) to generate reactive metabolites, N-acetyl-p-
benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) and tricholoromethyl radical (·CCl3), respectively.AlOHin
turn is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to its reactive metabolite, acrolein.
The glutathione adductof acrolein is converted by CYPs to glycidaldehyde. Toxicity
resulting from these reactive metabolites is multifactorial and includes lipid peroxidation,
generation of oxidative stress, altered cellular redox status and protein adduct
formation(Burcham & Fontaine, 2001; Cohen et al., 1997; Jaeschke et al., 2012; Ohno et al.,
1985; Tom et al., 1984). During cholestasis resulting from either BDL or ANIT treatment,
increase in bile acid concentration stimulates production of reactive oxygen species
eventually leading to hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis (Sokol et al., 1995; Trauner et
al., 1998).
The role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) role as a master defense against
hepatotoxicity produced by various chemicals has been investigated in several studies. Nrf2
belongs to the cap ‘n’ collar family of transcription factors that promotes transcription of a
battery of cytoprotective genes(Aleksunes & Manautou, 2007; Kensler et al., 2007). Under

basal conditions, Nrf2 is largely bound to the cytoskeletal anchoring protein Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) also known as cytosolic Nrf2 inhibitor in the
cytoplasm.In response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 andtranslocatesto the
nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to the GTGACA***GC core sequence of the antioxidant
response element (ARE) (Rushmore et al., 1991) and promotes ARE-mediated antioxidant
gene expression.
A low toxic APAP dose causes nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in mouse liver, which is
accompanied by increased expression of Nrf2 dependent cytoprotectivegenes such as heme
oxygenase-1 (Hmox1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1) and glutamate cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) (Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al.,
2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring et al., 2004). Similar results have been reported with
ANIT, BDL, CCl4 and AlOH, other models of hepatic oxidative stress used in the present
study(Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Randle et al., 2008;
Tanaka et al., 2009). On the other hand, Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to 
APAP-induced liver injury compared to their wild-type counterparts (Chan et al., 2001; Enomoto et
al., 2001). Likewise, Nrf2 KO mice arealso more susceptible to CCl4- andAlOH-induced
hepatoxicity compared towild-type mice (Liu et al., 2013). However, Nrf2 KO mice do not
exhibit any difference in susceptibility to either BDL or ANIT treatment(Tanaka et al., 2009;
Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012). This response is attributed to the adaptive compensatory
changesinvolving nuclear transcription factors, including Fxr, Shp, Pxr andHnf1α, efflux
bile acid transporters, altered GSH levels and bile flow rates in Nrf2 KO mice (Tanaka et al.,
2009; Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012). Collectively, the models of hepatic injury selected for
the current study not only result in hepatic oxidative stress but also activate the Nrf2-Keap1
regulatory pathway.
Despite Fmo3 being considered non-inducible, studies with aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) agonists in mice revealed liver Fmo3 gene induction (Celius et al., 2008; Celius et al.,
2010). A recent gene array analysis performed in our laboratory also demonstrated Fmo3
gene induction in the APAP autoprotection mouse model (mice receiving a low hepatotoxic
APAP dose that become resistant to a subsequent higher APAP dose)(O'Connor et al.,
2014).Unlike with AhR agonists that result in marginal increases in Fmo3 protein expression
in mouse liver, we showed significant increases in Fmo3 protein levels by 15-fold in APAP
autoprotectedmice(Rudraiah et al., 2014). Fmo3 induction by other hepatotoxicants that
produce oxidative stress is not currently known.
In human liver, transcription factors regulating constitutive FMO3expression as well as
those involved in developmental expression pattern have been extensively studied (Klick &
Hines, 2007; Klick et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2008). Because the mammalian FMOs were
considered non-inducible by xenobiotics (Cashman & Zhang, 2002; Krueger & Williams,
2005), the transcriptional regulation of FMO involving stress-activated transcription
factorsor receptors that bind ligands andinteract with DNAwas not studied as other forms of
regulation. Thus, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of Fmo3 in response to
toxicant exposure. Recently, Celius et al. (2010) showed that the Fmo3 mRNA up-regulation
by 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) but not TCDD in Hepa-1 cells is

mediated by p53 and its binding to a p53-response element in the promoter region of
Fmo3(Celius et al., 2010).
Differentially expressed genes in the APAP autoprotection model were further analyzed
usingCausal Reasoning Engine (CRE), a recently developed computational platform
(O'Connor et al., 2014). CRE analysis provides hypotheses on the upstream molecular
events that best explain gene expression profiles based on prior biological knowledge. CRE
analysis of differentially expressed genes in APAP autoprotection study supportsan
induction of the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). Additionally, the 5'-flanking region
of the mouse Fmo3 contains multiple copies of the ARE (Celius et al., 2008). Therefore, the
purpose of the present study was to investigate liver Fmo3gene expression under oxidative
stress conditions involving activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. Mice were
dosed with hepatotoxicants APAP(400 mg/kg, 24 to 48h), ANIT (50 mg/kg, 2 to 48h),
CCl4(10 or 30 μL/kg, 24 and 48h) or AlOH (30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24h)orunderwent sham
surgery or bile duct ligation (10d). Doses selected for hepatotoxicants are based upon
previous studies conducted in our laboratory resulting in oxidative stress and tissue injury.
The inclusion of multiple time-points followinghepatotoxicantsexposure enabled
comprehensive characterization of temporal changes in Fmo3 in relation to injury and
recovery. Further, in order to investigate whether Nrf2 mediatesFmo3 gene expression, Nrf2
KO mice were employed. APAP was used as a model toxicant in the Nrf2 KO mice study.
From these experiments,it is concluded that not all hepatotoxicantsthat produce oxidative
stress in mice induce liver Fmo3 gene expression. Toxic ANIT treatment, along with the
previously demonstrated APAP treatment, markedly increases Fmo3 gene expression. While
BDL increases Fmo3 mRNA expression, protein levels do not change.APAP treatment
induces Fmo3 gene expression in Nrf2 KO mice liver suggesting that the transcriptional
regulation of Fmo3 might not involve Nrf2.

of six mice. For APAP treatment, mice were treated with APAP (400 mg/kg, ip) in 50%
propylene glycol or vehicle only (dosing volume: 5 mL/kg). Animals were sacrificed by
decapitation at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment and blood and livers were collected for
analysis. For ANIT treatment, mice were administered ANIT (50 mg/kg, po) in corn oil or
vehicle only (dosing volume: 10 mL/kg). At 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment, mice
were sacrificed by decapitation for collecting samples. For CCl4 treatment, groups of mice
were injected CCl4 (10 or 30 μL/kg, ip) in corn oil or vehicle only (dosing volume: 6
mL/kg) and 24 and 48 h after treatment, mice were sacrificed by decapitation to collect
blood and livers for analysis. For AlOH treatment, mice were administered AlOH (30 or 60
mg/kg, ip) in saline or vehicle only (dosing volume: 10 mL/kg). Animals were sacrificed by
decapitation at 6 and 24 h after treatment for sample collection and analysis. BDL liver
samples were obtained from a previously described cohort (Donepudi et al., 2012). Briefly,
sham or BDL surgery was performed under phenobarbital-induced anesthesia (65 mg/kg,
ip). The surgeries were performed at the University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy
animal facility with IACUC approval. Serum and liver were collected 10 d after surgery for
analysis.
2.2.2 Experimental Design 2-The goal of experimental design 2 was to investigate
whether Nrf2 mediateschanges in liverFmo3 gene expression. APAP was used as a model
toxicant for Nrf2 activation.Nrf2 KO mice with a C57BL/6J background werekindly
provided by Dr. Angela Slitt from the University of Rhode Island.Following overnight
fasting, male Nrf2KO mice (n=6) and their wild-type counterparts (C57BL/6J) (n=6) were
treated with APAP (400 mg/kg, ip) in 50% PG or vehicle (dosing volume: 5 mL/kg). Plasma
and livers were collected 72h after APAP treatment for analysis.
All animal studies were performed in accordance with National Institute of Health standards
and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This work was approved by the
University of Connecticut's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.3 Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Assay
Plasma or serum ALT activity was determined as a biochemical indicator of hepatocellular
injury. Infinity ALT Liquid Stable Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA)
was used to determine ALT activity. Briefly, 100 μL of reagent was added to 10 μL serum or
plasma samples, and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nmusing a
Bio-Tek Power Wave X Spectrophotometer. ALT activity (IU/L) was determined using the
molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6.3 mM−1cm−1).
2.4 Total Bile acid Assay
Total bile acids were extracted from whole liver homogenates using a t-butanol extraction
method. Briefly, livers were homogenized in extraction solution (1:1, water: tbutanol) and
bile acids extracted overnight at room temperature in the dark. Blood levels of total bile acid
and hepatic bile acid levels were measured using a spectrophotometric bile acid assay kit
(Bioquant, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol.

2.5 RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver samples using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAwas
then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an M-MLV RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Fmo3 mRNA expression was quantified by the ΔΔCT method and normalized to two
housekeeping genes, β-actin and ribosomal protein S18. Data presented were normalized to
β-actin. Primer pairs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and
are as follow: Fmo3 forward: 5′-GGA AGA GTT GGT GAA GAC CG-3′, reverse: 5′-CCC
ACA TGC TTT GAG AGG AG-3′. Amplification was performed using an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Amplification was carried out in a 20μL
reaction volume containing 8 μL diluted cDNA, Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 1μM of each primer.
2.6 Preparation of Microsomal Fraction and Western Blot Analysis
Microsomes were isolated from livers as described previously (Cashman &Hanzlik, 1981;
Rudraiah et al., 2014) and stored at −80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined
by the method of Lowry using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). For western blot analysis, microsomal proteins (10 μg) were
electrophoretically resolved using 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF-Plus
membrane (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5 % 
nonfat powdered milk in tris buffered saline containing 0.05% tween-20(TBS-T) for 8 h. A
rabbit anti-mouse Fmo3 primary antibody (GenScript USA Inc., NJ) (1:5000) was used to
detect Fmo3 with β-actin as a loading control. Blots were then incubated with HRP
conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG (1:2000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO). Protein-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescent kit (Thermo
Scientific, IL) with visualization using GeneMate blue autoradiography film (Bioexpress,
Kaysville, UT). Precision plus protein dual color standards molecular weight marker (Bio-
radLaboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to identify Fmo3 protein on the blot and
microsomal protein isolated from naïve female mouse liver was used as a positive control.
2.7 Enzyme Assay
Methimazole (MMI) metabolism was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the
rate of MMI S-oxygenation via the reaction of the oxidized product with nitro-5-
thiobenzoate (TNB) to generate 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). The incubation
mixture consisted of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.5 mM
glucose-6-phosphate, 1.5 IU/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.06 mM DTNB, 0.04
mMdithiothreitol and 100 to 150 μg/mL liver microsomes isolated from mice. Reactions
were initiated by the addition of different amounts of MMI (substrate), with a concentration
range from 1.25 to 800 μM. Incubations were done in duplicates. The disappearance of the
yellow color was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm and specific activity
(μM/min/mg) was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of NADPH (28.2
mM−1cm−1).

2.8 Statistical Analysis
Page 7
The statistical significance between groups was determined using the Student's t-test, 
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc test or two-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni'spost-hoc test. While Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different
treatment groups, ANOVA was used to compare the means of more than two treatment
groups that are normally distributed with a common variance. All statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA). Data are presented as mean ± standard error (SE), with p<0.05 considered
statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1 Plasma ALT Activity in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
The time-points selected for the single dose APAP (400 mg/kg)treatment studyin mice were
based on the previous studies that demonstrated Fmo3 mRNA and protein peaks at 48 h and
72 h, respectively(O'Connor et al., 2014; Rudraiah et al., 2014). The hepatotoxicity of a
single dose APAP (400 mg/kg) at 24, 48 and 72 h as assessed by plasma ALT activity has
been reported previously (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Briefly, APAP increased plasma ALT
activity to 191±18 and 219±47IU/L at 24 and 48 h, respectively (mean plasma ALT activity
in control mice was 25±5IU/L). Plasma ALT activity was not statistically different from
vehicle controlsby 72 h, indicating recovery from APAP-induced liver injury.Plasma ALT
activity in all mouse models of liver injury is shown in Figure 1. ANIT increased ALT
activity at 12 h (182±9 IU/L), which continued to increase at 24 and 48 h (715±126 IU/L
and 781±45 IU/L, respectively) compared to vehicle control group (9±1 IU/L). BDL for 10
d results in an elevation of ALT activity to 185±10 IU/L. A high CCl4 dose (30 μL/kg)
increased plasma ALT at 24 and 48 h to 6367±1135 and 397±111 IU/L, respectively. A low
CCl4 dose (10 μL/kg) also increased plasma ALT activity at 24 and 48 h to 757±106 and
416±68 IU/L, respectively. The greatest increase in plasma ALT with both doses of CCl4 is
observed at 24 h. While AlOHtreatment (low dose, 30 mg/kg) did not result in significant
increases in ALT levels at 6 h and 24 h (36±4 and 73±24 IU/L, respectively),a high
AlOHdose (60 mg/kg) results in significantly higher ALT levels at both 6 h and 24 h
(153±50 and 4440±2428 IU/L, respectively). The associated histopathological damage with
all hepatotoxicants has been reported previously(Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al.,
2006; Campion et al., 2009; Donepudi et al., 2012; Rudraiah et al., 2014). With acute
toxicity models, plasma ALT activity lesser than 1000 IU/L is usually associated with a
minimal to mild hepatocellular damage (histological grade of 2 or less than 2), and an ALT
activity higher than 1000 IU/L is associated with moderate, marked or severe hepatocellular
damage (histological grade of 3, 4, or 5) (Aleksunes et al., 2008; Manautou et al., 1994).
Alternatively, a 10 d BDL with an associated ALT activityof less than 200 IU/L, exhibit a
chronic hepatocellular damage involving fibrosis (Donepudi et al., 2012).
3.2 Hepatic Bile Acid Concentrations in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
To determine the extent of cholestasis induced by different hepatotoxicants used in the
current study, total hepatic bile acid levels were measured (Figure 2). As expected ANIT
increased hepatic bile acid levels to 1.7±0.2 and 1.6±0.4 μmol/g at 24 and 48 h, respectively,

Page 8
compared to 0 h vehicle control group (0.2±0.02 μmol/g). BDL also increased hepatic bile
acid concentrations to 19.49±0.85 μmol/100 mg compared to sham operated group
(10.61±1.65 μmol/g). No significant changes were observed in mice treated with APAP,
CCl4 and AlOH.
3.3 Total bile Acid Concentrations in the Blood in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Bile acid concentration in plasma is also a biomarker of cholestasis. In order to determine
the extent of cholestasis,plasma bile acid levels were also quantified in all mouse models of
liver injury (Figure 3). Plasma bile acid concentration increased in ANIT treated mice at 24
and 48 h to 210±20 and 330±128 μmol/L, respectively, compared with vehicle treated mice
(2±0.2 μmol/L). Bile duct ligation significantly increased serum bile acid levels to 1359±142
μmol/L compared to sham operated mice (86±11 μmol/L). Significant increases in plasma
bile acid concentrationsare seen in high dose CCl4 treated mice at both 24 and 48 h (112±15
μmol/Land 29±2 μmol/L, respectively). Exposure to APAP and AlOH did not result in any
significant change in plasma bile acid levels.
3.4 Hepatic Fmo3 mRNA Expression in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Fmo3 mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and the results are presented in Figure 4.
Fmo3 mRNA expression following a single dose APAP 400 mg/kg treatment has been
previously reported (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Briefly, Fmo3 mRNA levelsincreased by 5±2.6-
and 23±5.6-fold, at 24 and 48 h after APAP, respectively, compared to the 0 h control group.
ANIT increased Fmo3 mRNA levels as early as 2 h after treatment. This increase peaked
and is statistically significant only at 12 h (43±10-fold increase), compared to 0 h vehicle
control group. BDL also increased Fmo3 mRNA expression by 1899±625-fold, compared to
sham operated mice. Both the low and high dose of CCl4decreased Fmo3 mRNA levels at
both time-points examined, and this decrease is statistically significant only at 48 h (10
μL/kg: 0.2±0.06-fold and 30 μL/kg: 0.2±0.08-fold). No change in liver Fmo3 mRNA levels
was observed with AlOH treatment.
3.5 Fmo3 Protein Expression in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Temporal expression of the Fmo3 protein following exposure to hepatotoxicants and BDL
were quantified by western blotting. Representative blots and associated densitometric
analyses are shown in Figure 5. Fmo3 protein increase following APAP treatment has been
previously reported (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Although the expression of Fmo3 protein tended
to increase by 1.1±0.3-to 1.6±0.2-fold between 24 and 72 h after APAP, the increase is
statistically significant only at 72h. Consistent with Fmo3 mRNA changes evidenced with
ANIT treatment, Fmo3 protein levels also tend to increase as early as 2 h. However, this
increase is significant only at 12 h (3.5±0.9-fold) compared to 0 h vehicle treated group.
Fmo3 protein levels decreased to 0.7±0.08- and 0.3±0.1-fold at 24 and 48h, respectively,
after exposure to ANIT. Conversely, in spite of the dramatic increase in Fmo3 mRNA levels
after BDL, Fmo3 protein levels did notchange. No significant changes in Fmo3 protein
expression are observed with CCl4 orAlOH treatment.

3.6 Plasma ALT Activity and Fmo3 mRNA Levels after APAP Treatment in Wild-Type and
Nrf2 Knockout Mice
All models of hepatic injury used in the current study activate the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory
pathway. Furthermore, CRE analysis of differentially expressed genes in our APAP
autoprotection study supportedan induction of the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). To
investigate whether Nrf2 mediatesFmo3 gene expression, APAP was used as a model
toxicant for Nrf2 activation in Nrf2 KO and WT mice. Mice were administered a single 400
mg/kg APAP dose for 72 h. Dose and time-point selected were based on our single dose
APAP study performed previously (Rudraiah et al., 2014), wherea 400 mg/kg APAP
treatment increased Fmo3 protein levels at 72 h. Administration of 400 mg/kg APAP to
male C57Bl/6J WT mice did not resultin significantlydifferent plasma ALT values at 72 h
from vehicle controls. This is consistent with the previously reported results, indicating
recovery from APAP-induced liver injury and increased Fmo3 protein expression in WT
mice (Rudraiah et al., 2014). In contrast, plasma ALT activity is elevated at 72 h in Nrf2 KO
mice receiving the same dose of APAP (176±12 IU/L) compared to vehicle control group
(23±5 IU/L) (Figure 6A). This is again consistent with the literature and confirms that Nrf2
plays animportant role not only in the magnitude of toxicity, but also the degree and rate of
recovery from APAP-induced liver injury. Fmo3 mRNA levels were quantified by 
qRT-PCR. The results in Figure 6B show that there is no change in Fmo3 mRNA levels at 72 h in
wild-type mice administered 400 mg/kg APAP. This is again consistent with previous
reports, where maximal Fmo3 mRNA expression is seen at 48 h after APAP administration
and returns to normal by 72 h (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Notably, Fmo3 mRNA expression is
significantly higherin Nrf2 KO mice 72 h after APAP treatment by 140±43-fold change
compared to vehicle control group.
3.7 Fmo3 Protein Expression after APAP Treatment in Wild-Type and Nrf2 Knockout Mice
To examine the temporal changes in Fmo3 gene expression following APAP treatment in
WT and Nrf2 KO mice, Fmo3 protein levels were quantified by western blotting and by
measuring catalytic activity using MMI as substrate. Representative blots and associated
densitometric analysis are shown in Figure 7A. Consistent with increased Fmo3 mRNA
expression in Nrf2 KO mice administered APAP (400 mg/kg) at 72 h, Fmo3 protein levels
are also significantly higher (5.1±1.3-fold) compared to vehicle control group. Measuring
FMO catalytic activity using MMI can also quantitate Fmo3 protein induction(Zhang et al.,
2007). FMO specific activity increased significantly in Nrf2 KO livers (48±6±M/min/mg) at
72 h after APAP compared to vehicle controls of either genotype (Figure 7B).

4. Discussion
FMO3 is a microsomal enzyme involved in the oxygenation of lipophilic substrates to more
polar metabolites. Substrates include nitrogen-, sulfur- and phosphorous-containing drugs
and xenobiotics, and most metabolic products of Fmo3 are considered to be 
non-toxic(Krueger & Williams, 2005). Although FMOs were discovered in the 1960s (Miller et
al., 1960) and further purified in 1972 (Ziegler & Mitchell, 1972), it was not until 2008 that
Fmo3 induction by xenobiotics was demonstrated (Celius et al., 2008; Celius et al., 2010). In
these studies, in spite ofa very large increase in Fmo3 mRNA level by AhR agonist

treatment, only a modest increase in protein level and function was reported. A gene array
analysis performed in our laboratory also demonstrated Fmo3gene induction in the mouse
model of APAP autoprotection(O'Connor et al., 2014). In this APAP autoprotection mouse
model, we showed a significant increase in Fmo3 protein expression and function (Rudraiah
et al., 2014). Constitutive Fmo3 expression in a female mouse liver is localized in the areas
surrounding the periportal region (Janmohamed et al., 2004; Rudraiah et al., 2014).
Following APAP exposure, the Fmo3 protein expression in APAP autoprotected livers was
observed in the centrilobular regions where APAP-induced damage and/or hepatocellular
compensatory proliferation is detected. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced expression
of Fmo3 confers resistance against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice (Rudraiah et al.,
2014).
In the present study, the effect of various other hepatotoxicants on Fmo3 gene expression in
male C57BL/6J mouse liver was examined. A unifying theme for all hepatotoxicants used in
our study is the oxidative stress. These models of oxidative stress used are very well studied
with respect to activation of Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. This has been
repeatedlydemonstrated in our laboratory and in the literature (Aleksunes et al., 2005;
Aleksunes et al., 2006; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring
et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013; Randle et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2009). Thus, we were
confident that the treatments selected result in oxidative stress and therefore the need for
measuring markers of oxidative stress for each experimentalgroup of hepatotoxicity was not
deemed necessary.
Coincidentally, all of the hepatotoxicants selected produce cholestasis, with the exception of
AlOH(Donepudi et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2009; Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012; Yamazaki
et al., 2013). Furthermore, perturbation of bile acid homeostasis has been demonstrated to be
an early event in the pathogenesis of drug induced liver injury(Yamazaki et al., 2013). To
determine whether accumulation of bile acids is a signaling event regulating Fmo3, we
measured total hepatic and plasma bile acid levels. Consistent with the literature, ANIT and
BDL increased plasma and hepatic bile acid concentrations. A high CCl4dose did not
significantly alter liver bile acid levels, but significantly increased plasma bile acid
concentration. APAP tended to increase both hepatic and plasma bile acid concentrations,
but this is not statistically significant.
In general, ANIT and BDL-mediated damage significantly increased liver Fmo3 mRNA
expression. While CCl4-mediated liver injury significantly decreased Fmo3 mRNA
expression, no change in expression is evidenced with AlOH. Fmo3 mRNA expressionin
response to ANIT treatment precedes serum and hepatic bile acid accumulation and the
maximal Fmo3 expression (both mRNA and protein) parallels the mild hepatocellular
damage observed. This observation argues against the concept that hepatic bile acid
accumulation is a pre-requisite for Fmo3 gene expression changes in the ANIT model. With
BDL, unlike ANIT, Fmo3 mRNA induction is associated with higher serum and hepatic bile
acid levels, but protein level does not change. Since tissues were analyzed 10 days after
BDL, we do not have a sense of what the temporal relationship is between hepatic bile acid
accumulation and elevated Fmo3 mRNA induction. This relationship deserves further
attention based on the discussion of FXR signaling that can be found below.

Overt ANIT-induced hepatocellular damage at 24 and 48 h decreased Fmo3 gene expression
and the decease is statistically significant at 48 h compared to the 12 h ANIT-treated group.
This observation with respect to the relationship between plasma ALT level and Fmo3 gene
expression is consistent with our results with APAP hepatotoxicity. We have demonstrated
in our APAP autoprotection mouse model that the APAP (400 mg/kg) pretreated group as
well as the autoprotected group (APAP pretreatment: 400 mg/kg, APAP challenge: 600
mg/kg) exhibit average plasma ALT values of about 250 IU/L and Fmo3 protein induction.
The group that receives a toxic APAP dose of 600 mg/kg exhibits much greater average
plasma ALT activity of about 1600 IU/L, but no Fmo3 gene induction (Rudraiah et al.,
2014).
One key feature that is consistent with APAP-, BDL- and ANIT-induced liver injury and
enhanced Fmo3 gene expression is the magnitude in plasma ALT elevations. Mild ALT
elevation is the common feature for all three models where Fmo3 mRNA induction is
observed. Although BDL is a chronic injury model, it well known that the ALT values do
not correlate well with the severity of liver damage particularly during fibrotic
hepatocellular necrosis (Kallai et al., 1964). A similar clinical feature is also seen in cases of
primary biliary cirrhosis (BDL models primary biliary cirrhosis in humans) (Hohenester et
al., 2009). The lack of Fmo3 protein detection during BDL may be due to signal dilution by
fibrotic liver tissue. It is also possible that under oxidative stress conditions some proteins
involved in translation are oxidized in vivo inhibiting translation (Shenton et al., 2006). To
add to this complexity, in spite of lower plasma ALT activity at 24 h (low dose CCl4), and
48 h (both high and low dose CCl4) with CCl4, there is down-regulation of Fmo3 gene
expression. In AlOH-treated livers, lower plasma ALT activity did not show any change in
Fmo3 gene expression. This is suggestive of an unknown underlying mechanism unique to
APAP, ANIT and BDL, which is contributing to Fmo3 mRNA induction. Studies are
necessary to investigate the regional distribution of Fmo3 protein expression during 
ANIT-and BDL-induced liver injury to determine whether the protein expression in these models is
localized to the portal vein, where ANIT- and BDL-induced hepatotoxicity is confined.
Collectively, these data suggest that there is a threshold for degree of hepatic injury that
results in increased Fmo3 gene and protein expression.More specifically,these data suggest
that acute moderate or mild hepatotoxicity is optional for Fmo3 induction, while chronic,
severe hepatotoxicity is not.
As discussed before, all models of hepatic injury used in the current study result in hepatic
oxidative stress and activate the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. Importantly, CRE analysis
of differentially expressed genes in our APAP autoprotection study supportedan induction of
the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). Additionally, Celius et al. (2008) showed that the
5'-flanking region of the mouse Fmo3 contains multiple copies of the ARE (Celius et al.,
2008). Promoter analysis of mouse Fmo3 promoter (7 kb length)using MatInspector
software (Genomatix, Munich, Germany), also showed an ARE at about 3 kb from the
transcription start site (data not shown). We also found two other binding sites for Bach1, at
600 bp and 2 kb from the Fmo3 transcription start site (data not shown). Bach1 is a
regulatory mediator of Nrf2, in that it is a transcription repressor. Bach1 heterodimerizes
with small Maf proteins in the absence of cellular stress and represses gene expression. In

the presence of oxidative stress, Bach1 is released from the Maf proteins and is replaced by
Nrf2(Kaspar et al., 2009). Thus, using APAP as a model toxicant for Nrf2 activation, Fmo3
gene expression was evaluated inNrf2 KO mice. Compared to APAP-treated wild-type mice,
Nrf2 KO mice exhibit persistent and significant hepatocellular damage 72 h after APAP
administration. Nrf2 KO mice are not only more susceptible to APAP-induced
hepatocellular necrosis, but also fail to recover from injury as rapidly as the WT mice. This
is consistent with the literature that describes Nrf2 as a master regulator of many
cytoprotective genes involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (Aleksunes et al., 2005;
Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring et al., 2004). Finally,
Fmo3 gene induction by APAP treatment in Nrf2 null mice suggests that the transcriptional
regulation of Fmo3does not involve this transcription factor. The persistent mild
hepatocellular injury and oxidative stress in Nrf2 KO mice most likely activates other
signaling mechanisms involved in Fmo3 gene induction.
Future studies will investigate the role of other nuclear receptors in Fmo3 gene induction.
Particularly, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) role in Fmo3 gene induction during APAP
hepatotoxicity is worth investigating. FXR is one of the major bile acid sensors in the liver
(Chiang, 2002) and plays a protective role during cholestasis development. Recently, it is
shown that activation of FXR induces Fmo3 protein function (Bennett et al., 2013).
Activation of FXR also provides protection against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity(F. Y. Lee
et al., 2010). In addition, we discovered three binding sites for farnesoid X receptor-response
element (FXRE) at about 1.6, 2.1 and 3.3 kb from the transcription start site on the mouse
Fmo3 promoter (data not shown). Although, Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is also a bile acid
sensor, no binding sites for PXR were found on promoter analysis and furthermore, PXR
activation sensitizes APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (Cheng et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2004).
In conclusion, this study comprehensively characterizes for the first time temporal changes
in Fmo3 gene expression during different conditions known to impart hepatic oxidative
stress. In particular, we show that toxic ANIT and BDL significantly alter Fmo3 mRNA
expression, but only Fmo3 protein with ANIT. The reason for this discrepancy is not yet
clear or easy to rationalize. It is possible that Fmo3 is also protective during other 
chemical-induced liver injury including ANIT. Even though the exact mechanism of Fmo3 gene
expression or its role in protecting against toxicant-induced liver injury is not yet clear, the
observed toxicity threshold for Fmo3 gene expression is intriguing. This work advances the
lack of knowledge with regard to the inducibility of Fmo3 and its potential protective role in
drug-induced liver injury.

Abstract
Flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) catalyzes metabolic reactions similar to cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase however, most metabolites of FMO3 are considered non-toxic. Recent
findings in our laboratory demonstrated Fmo3gene induction following toxic acetaminophen
(APAP) treatment in mice.The goal of this study was to evaluate Fmo3gene expression in
diverseother mouse models of hepatic oxidative stress and injury. Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2
was also investigated using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. In our studies, male C57BL/6J mice
were treated with toxic dosesof hepatotoxicants or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL, 10d).
Hepatotoxicants included APAP (400 mg/kg, 24 to 72h), alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT; 50
mg/kg, 2 to 48h), carbontetrachloride (CCl4;10 or 30 μL/kg, 24 and 48h) and allyl alcohol (AlOH;
30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24h). Because oxidative stress activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
2)-like 2 (Nrf2), additional studies investigated Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2 using Nrf2
knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. At appropriate time-points, blood and liver samples were collected for
assessment of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, plasma and hepatic bile acid
levels, as well as liver Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression. Fmo3 mRNA expression increased

significantly by 43-fold at 12h after ANIT treatment,and this increase translates to a 4-fold change
in protein levels. BDL also increased Fmo3 mRNA expression by 1899-fold, but with no change
in protein levels. Treatment of mice with CCl4decreased liver Fmo3gene expression, whileno
change in expression was detected with AlOH treatment. Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to
APAP (400 mg/kg, 72h) treatment compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, which is
evidenced by greater plasma ALT activity. Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression increased in Nrf2
KO mice after APAP treatment. Collectively, not all hepatotoxicantsthat produce oxidative stress
alter Fmo3gene expression. Along with APAP, toxic ANIT treatment in mice markedly
increasedFmo3 gene expression. While BDL increased Fmo3 mRNA expression, protein level did
not change. The discrepancy with Fmo3 induction in cholestatic models, ANIT and BDL, is not
entirely clear. Results from Nrf2 KO mice with APAP suggest that the transcriptional regulation
of Fmo3 during liver injury may not involve Nrf2.

>>>section: discussion
4. Discussion
FMO3 is a microsomal enzyme involved in the oxygenation of lipophilic substrates to more
polar metabolites. Substrates include nitrogen-, sulfur- and phosphorous-containing drugs
and xenobiotics, and most metabolic products of Fmo3 are considered to be 
non-toxic(Krueger & Williams, 2005). Although FMOs were discovered in the 1960s (Miller et
al., 1960) and further purified in 1972 (Ziegler & Mitchell, 1972), it was not until 2008 that
Fmo3 induction by xenobiotics was demonstrated (Celius et al., 2008; Celius et al., 2010). In
these studies, in spite ofa very large increase in Fmo3 mRNA level by AhR agonist

treatment, only a modest increase in protein level and function was reported. A gene array
analysis performed in our laboratory also demonstrated Fmo3gene induction in the mouse
model of APAP autoprotection(O'Connor et al., 2014). In this APAP autoprotection mouse
model, we showed a significant increase in Fmo3 protein expression and function (Rudraiah
et al., 2014). Constitutive Fmo3 expression in a female mouse liver is localized in the areas
surrounding the periportal region (Janmohamed et al., 2004; Rudraiah et al., 2014).
Following APAP exposure, the Fmo3 protein expression in APAP autoprotected livers was
observed in the centrilobular regions where APAP-induced damage and/or hepatocellular
compensatory proliferation is detected. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced expression
of Fmo3 confers resistance against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice (Rudraiah et al.,
2014).
In the present study, the effect of various other hepatotoxicants on Fmo3 gene expression in
male C57BL/6J mouse liver was examined. A unifying theme for all hepatotoxicants used in
our study is the oxidative stress. These models of oxidative stress used are very well studied
with respect to activation of Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. This has been
repeatedlydemonstrated in our laboratory and in the literature (Aleksunes et al., 2005;
Aleksunes et al., 2006; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring
et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013; Randle et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2009). Thus, we were
confident that the treatments selected result in oxidative stress and therefore the need for
measuring markers of oxidative stress for each experimentalgroup of hepatotoxicity was not
deemed necessary.
Coincidentally, all of the hepatotoxicants selected produce cholestasis, with the exception of
AlOH(Donepudi et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2009; Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012; Yamazaki
et al., 2013). Furthermore, perturbation of bile acid homeostasis has been demonstrated to be
an early event in the pathogenesis of drug induced liver injury(Yamazaki et al., 2013). To
determine whether accumulation of bile acids is a signaling event regulating Fmo3, we
measured total hepatic and plasma bile acid levels. Consistent with the literature, ANIT and
BDL increased plasma and hepatic bile acid concentrations. A high CCl4dose did not
significantly alter liver bile acid levels, but significantly increased plasma bile acid
concentration. APAP tended to increase both hepatic and plasma bile acid concentrations,
but this is not statistically significant.
In general, ANIT and BDL-mediated damage significantly increased liver Fmo3 mRNA
expression. While CCl4-mediated liver injury significantly decreased Fmo3 mRNA
expression, no change in expression is evidenced with AlOH. Fmo3 mRNA expressionin
response to ANIT treatment precedes serum and hepatic bile acid accumulation and the
maximal Fmo3 expression (both mRNA and protein) parallels the mild hepatocellular
damage observed. This observation argues against the concept that hepatic bile acid
accumulation is a pre-requisite for Fmo3 gene expression changes in the ANIT model. With
BDL, unlike ANIT, Fmo3 mRNA induction is associated with higher serum and hepatic bile
acid levels, but protein level does not change. Since tissues were analyzed 10 days after
BDL, we do not have a sense of what the temporal relationship is between hepatic bile acid
accumulation and elevated Fmo3 mRNA induction. This relationship deserves further
attention based on the discussion of FXR signaling that can be found below.

Overt ANIT-induced hepatocellular damage at 24 and 48 h decreased Fmo3 gene expression
and the decease is statistically significant at 48 h compared to the 12 h ANIT-treated group.
This observation with respect to the relationship between plasma ALT level and Fmo3 gene
expression is consistent with our results with APAP hepatotoxicity. We have demonstrated
in our APAP autoprotection mouse model that the APAP (400 mg/kg) pretreated group as
well as the autoprotected group (APAP pretreatment: 400 mg/kg, APAP challenge: 600
mg/kg) exhibit average plasma ALT values of about 250 IU/L and Fmo3 protein induction.
The group that receives a toxic APAP dose of 600 mg/kg exhibits much greater average
plasma ALT activity of about 1600 IU/L, but no Fmo3 gene induction (Rudraiah et al.,
2014).
One key feature that is consistent with APAP-, BDL- and ANIT-induced liver injury and
enhanced Fmo3 gene expression is the magnitude in plasma ALT elevations. Mild ALT
elevation is the common feature for all three models where Fmo3 mRNA induction is
observed. Although BDL is a chronic injury model, it well known that the ALT values do
not correlate well with the severity of liver damage particularly during fibrotic
hepatocellular necrosis (Kallai et al., 1964). A similar clinical feature is also seen in cases of
primary biliary cirrhosis (BDL models primary biliary cirrhosis in humans) (Hohenester et
al., 2009). The lack of Fmo3 protein detection during BDL may be due to signal dilution by
fibrotic liver tissue. It is also possible that under oxidative stress conditions some proteins
involved in translation are oxidized in vivo inhibiting translation (Shenton et al., 2006). To
add to this complexity, in spite of lower plasma ALT activity at 24 h (low dose CCl4), and
48 h (both high and low dose CCl4) with CCl4, there is down-regulation of Fmo3 gene
expression. In AlOH-treated livers, lower plasma ALT activity did not show any change in
Fmo3 gene expression. This is suggestive of an unknown underlying mechanism unique to
APAP, ANIT and BDL, which is contributing to Fmo3 mRNA induction. Studies are
necessary to investigate the regional distribution of Fmo3 protein expression during 
ANIT-and BDL-induced liver injury to determine whether the protein expression in these models is
localized to the portal vein, where ANIT- and BDL-induced hepatotoxicity is confined.
Collectively, these data suggest that there is a threshold for degree of hepatic injury that
results in increased Fmo3 gene and protein expression.More specifically,these data suggest
that acute moderate or mild hepatotoxicity is optional for Fmo3 induction, while chronic,
severe hepatotoxicity is not.
As discussed before, all models of hepatic injury used in the current study result in hepatic
oxidative stress and activate the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. Importantly, CRE analysis
of differentially expressed genes in our APAP autoprotection study supportedan induction of
the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). Additionally, Celius et al. (2008) showed that the
5'-flanking region of the mouse Fmo3 contains multiple copies of the ARE (Celius et al.,
2008). Promoter analysis of mouse Fmo3 promoter (7 kb length)using MatInspector
software (Genomatix, Munich, Germany), also showed an ARE at about 3 kb from the
transcription start site (data not shown). We also found two other binding sites for Bach1, at
600 bp and 2 kb from the Fmo3 transcription start site (data not shown). Bach1 is a
regulatory mediator of Nrf2, in that it is a transcription repressor. Bach1 heterodimerizes
with small Maf proteins in the absence of cellular stress and represses gene expression. In

the presence of oxidative stress, Bach1 is released from the Maf proteins and is replaced by
Nrf2(Kaspar et al., 2009). Thus, using APAP as a model toxicant for Nrf2 activation, Fmo3
gene expression was evaluated inNrf2 KO mice. Compared to APAP-treated wild-type mice,
Nrf2 KO mice exhibit persistent and significant hepatocellular damage 72 h after APAP
administration. Nrf2 KO mice are not only more susceptible to APAP-induced
hepatocellular necrosis, but also fail to recover from injury as rapidly as the WT mice. This
is consistent with the literature that describes Nrf2 as a master regulator of many
cytoprotective genes involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (Aleksunes et al., 2005;
Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring et al., 2004). Finally,
Fmo3 gene induction by APAP treatment in Nrf2 null mice suggests that the transcriptional
regulation of Fmo3does not involve this transcription factor. The persistent mild
hepatocellular injury and oxidative stress in Nrf2 KO mice most likely activates other
signaling mechanisms involved in Fmo3 gene induction.
Future studies will investigate the role of other nuclear receptors in Fmo3 gene induction.
Particularly, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) role in Fmo3 gene induction during APAP
hepatotoxicity is worth investigating. FXR is one of the major bile acid sensors in the liver
(Chiang, 2002) and plays a protective role during cholestasis development. Recently, it is
shown that activation of FXR induces Fmo3 protein function (Bennett et al., 2013).
Activation of FXR also provides protection against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity(F. Y. Lee
et al., 2010). In addition, we discovered three binding sites for farnesoid X receptor-response
element (FXRE) at about 1.6, 2.1 and 3.3 kb from the transcription start site on the mouse
Fmo3 promoter (data not shown). Although, Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is also a bile acid
sensor, no binding sites for PXR were found on promoter analysis and furthermore, PXR
activation sensitizes APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (Cheng et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2004).
In conclusion, this study comprehensively characterizes for the first time temporal changes
in Fmo3 gene expression during different conditions known to impart hepatic oxidative
stress. In particular, we show that toxic ANIT and BDL significantly alter Fmo3 mRNA
expression, but only Fmo3 protein with ANIT. The reason for this discrepancy is not yet
clear or easy to rationalize. It is possible that Fmo3 is also protective during other 
chemical-induced liver injury including ANIT. Even though the exact mechanism of Fmo3 gene
expression or its role in protecting against toxicant-induced liver injury is not yet clear, the
observed toxicity threshold for Fmo3 gene expression is intriguing. This work advances the
lack of knowledge with regard to the inducibility of Fmo3 and its potential protective role in
drug-induced liver injury.

3. Results
3.1 Plasma ALT Activity in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
The time-points selected for the single dose APAP (400 mg/kg)treatment studyin mice were
based on the previous studies that demonstrated Fmo3 mRNA and protein peaks at 48 h and
72 h, respectively(O'Connor et al., 2014; Rudraiah et al., 2014). The hepatotoxicity of a
single dose APAP (400 mg/kg) at 24, 48 and 72 h as assessed by plasma ALT activity has
been reported previously (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Briefly, APAP increased plasma ALT
activity to 191±18 and 219±47IU/L at 24 and 48 h, respectively (mean plasma ALT activity
in control mice was 25±5IU/L). Plasma ALT activity was not statistically different from
vehicle controlsby 72 h, indicating recovery from APAP-induced liver injury.Plasma ALT
activity in all mouse models of liver injury is shown in Figure 1. ANIT increased ALT
activity at 12 h (182±9 IU/L), which continued to increase at 24 and 48 h (715±126 IU/L
and 781±45 IU/L, respectively) compared to vehicle control group (9±1 IU/L). BDL for 10
d results in an elevation of ALT activity to 185±10 IU/L. A high CCl4 dose (30 μL/kg)
increased plasma ALT at 24 and 48 h to 6367±1135 and 397±111 IU/L, respectively. A low
CCl4 dose (10 μL/kg) also increased plasma ALT activity at 24 and 48 h to 757±106 and
416±68 IU/L, respectively. The greatest increase in plasma ALT with both doses of CCl4 is
observed at 24 h. While AlOHtreatment (low dose, 30 mg/kg) did not result in significant
increases in ALT levels at 6 h and 24 h (36±4 and 73±24 IU/L, respectively),a high
AlOHdose (60 mg/kg) results in significantly higher ALT levels at both 6 h and 24 h
(153±50 and 4440±2428 IU/L, respectively). The associated histopathological damage with
all hepatotoxicants has been reported previously(Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al.,
2006; Campion et al., 2009; Donepudi et al., 2012; Rudraiah et al., 2014). With acute
toxicity models, plasma ALT activity lesser than 1000 IU/L is usually associated with a
minimal to mild hepatocellular damage (histological grade of 2 or less than 2), and an ALT
activity higher than 1000 IU/L is associated with moderate, marked or severe hepatocellular
damage (histological grade of 3, 4, or 5) (Aleksunes et al., 2008; Manautou et al., 1994).
Alternatively, a 10 d BDL with an associated ALT activityof less than 200 IU/L, exhibit a
chronic hepatocellular damage involving fibrosis (Donepudi et al., 2012).
3.2 Hepatic Bile Acid Concentrations in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
To determine the extent of cholestasis induced by different hepatotoxicants used in the
current study, total hepatic bile acid levels were measured (Figure 2). As expected ANIT
increased hepatic bile acid levels to 1.7±0.2 and 1.6±0.4 μmol/g at 24 and 48 h, respectively,
Toxicology. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 November 05.

Page 8
compared to 0 h vehicle control group (0.2±0.02 μmol/g). BDL also increased hepatic bile
acid concentrations to 19.49±0.85 μmol/100 mg compared to sham operated group
(10.61±1.65 μmol/g). No significant changes were observed in mice treated with APAP,
CCl4 and AlOH.
3.3 Total bile Acid Concentrations in the Blood in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Bile acid concentration in plasma is also a biomarker of cholestasis. In order to determine
the extent of cholestasis,plasma bile acid levels were also quantified in all mouse models of
liver injury (Figure 3). Plasma bile acid concentration increased in ANIT treated mice at 24
and 48 h to 210±20 and 330±128 μmol/L, respectively, compared with vehicle treated mice
(2±0.2 μmol/L). Bile duct ligation significantly increased serum bile acid levels to 1359±142
μmol/L compared to sham operated mice (86±11 μmol/L). Significant increases in plasma
bile acid concentrationsare seen in high dose CCl4 treated mice at both 24 and 48 h (112±15
μmol/Land 29±2 μmol/L, respectively). Exposure to APAP and AlOH did not result in any
significant change in plasma bile acid levels.
3.4 Hepatic Fmo3 mRNA Expression in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Fmo3 mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and the results are presented in Figure 4.
Fmo3 mRNA expression following a single dose APAP 400 mg/kg treatment has been
previously reported (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Briefly, Fmo3 mRNA levelsincreased by 5±2.6-
and 23±5.6-fold, at 24 and 48 h after APAP, respectively, compared to the 0 h control group.
ANIT increased Fmo3 mRNA levels as early as 2 h after treatment. This increase peaked
and is statistically significant only at 12 h (43±10-fold increase), compared to 0 h vehicle
control group. BDL also increased Fmo3 mRNA expression by 1899±625-fold, compared to
sham operated mice. Both the low and high dose of CCl4decreased Fmo3 mRNA levels at
both time-points examined, and this decrease is statistically significant only at 48 h (10
μL/kg: 0.2±0.06-fold and 30 μL/kg: 0.2±0.08-fold). No change in liver Fmo3 mRNA levels
was observed with AlOH treatment.
3.5 Fmo3 Protein Expression in the Mouse Liver Injury Models
Temporal expression of the Fmo3 protein following exposure to hepatotoxicants and BDL
were quantified by western blotting. Representative blots and associated densitometric
analyses are shown in Figure 5. Fmo3 protein increase following APAP treatment has been
previously reported (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Although the expression of Fmo3 protein tended
to increase by 1.1±0.3-to 1.6±0.2-fold between 24 and 72 h after APAP, the increase is
statistically significant only at 72h. Consistent with Fmo3 mRNA changes evidenced with
ANIT treatment, Fmo3 protein levels also tend to increase as early as 2 h. However, this
increase is significant only at 12 h (3.5±0.9-fold) compared to 0 h vehicle treated group.
Fmo3 protein levels decreased to 0.7±0.08- and 0.3±0.1-fold at 24 and 48h, respectively,
after exposure to ANIT. Conversely, in spite of the dramatic increase in Fmo3 mRNA levels
after BDL, Fmo3 protein levels did notchange. No significant changes in Fmo3 protein
expression are observed with CCl4 orAlOH treatment.

Rudraiah et al.
3.6 Plasma ALT Activity and Fmo3 mRNA Levels after APAP Treatment in Wild-Type and
Nrf2 Knockout Mice
All models of hepatic injury used in the current study activate the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory
pathway. Furthermore, CRE analysis of differentially expressed genes in our APAP
autoprotection study supportedan induction of the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). To
investigate whether Nrf2 mediatesFmo3 gene expression, APAP was used as a model
toxicant for Nrf2 activation in Nrf2 KO and WT mice. Mice were administered a single 400
mg/kg APAP dose for 72 h. Dose and time-point selected were based on our single dose
APAP study performed previously (Rudraiah et al., 2014), wherea 400 mg/kg APAP
treatment increased Fmo3 protein levels at 72 h. Administration of 400 mg/kg APAP to
male C57Bl/6J WT mice did not resultin significantlydifferent plasma ALT values at 72 h
from vehicle controls. This is consistent with the previously reported results, indicating
recovery from APAP-induced liver injury and increased Fmo3 protein expression in WT
mice (Rudraiah et al., 2014). In contrast, plasma ALT activity is elevated at 72 h in Nrf2 KO
mice receiving the same dose of APAP (176±12 IU/L) compared to vehicle control group
(23±5 IU/L) (Figure 6A). This is again consistent with the literature and confirms that Nrf2
plays animportant role not only in the magnitude of toxicity, but also the degree and rate of
recovery from APAP-induced liver injury. Fmo3 mRNA levels were quantified by 
qRT-PCR. The results in Figure 6B show that there is no change in Fmo3 mRNA levels at 72 h in
wild-type mice administered 400 mg/kg APAP. This is again consistent with previous
reports, where maximal Fmo3 mRNA expression is seen at 48 h after APAP administration
and returns to normal by 72 h (Rudraiah et al., 2014). Notably, Fmo3 mRNA expression is
significantly higherin Nrf2 KO mice 72 h after APAP treatment by 140±43-fold change
compared to vehicle control group.
3.7 Fmo3 Protein Expression after APAP Treatment in Wild-Type and Nrf2 Knockout Mice
To examine the temporal changes in Fmo3 gene expression following APAP treatment in
WT and Nrf2 KO mice, Fmo3 protein levels were quantified by western blotting and by
measuring catalytic activity using MMI as substrate. Representative blots and associated
densitometric analysis are shown in Figure 7A. Consistent with increased Fmo3 mRNA
expression in Nrf2 KO mice administered APAP (400 mg/kg) at 72 h, Fmo3 protein levels
are also significantly higher (5.1±1.3-fold) compared to vehicle control group. Measuring
FMO catalytic activity using MMI can also quantitate Fmo3 protein induction(Zhang et al.,
2007). FMO specific activity increased significantly in Nrf2 KO livers (48±6±M/min/mg) at
72 h after APAP compared to vehicle controls of either genotype (Figure 7B).

1. Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant challenge for both drug development and
clinical care. It accounts for more than 50% of all acute liver failure cases in the U.S.
(Larson et al., 2005; W. M. Lee, 2010). Many chemicals, such as acetaminophen (APAP),
carbontetrachloride (CCl4) and allyl alcohol (AlOH) have been used to model hepatotoxicity
relevant to human exposure. Alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and bile duct ligation
(BDL) on the other hand are used to model cholestasis, a pathological condition caused by
impairment of hepatic bile flow. While ANIT produces intrahepatic cholestasis, BDL
produces extrahepatic cholestasis. With APAP and CCl4, the parent compound is
metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) to generate reactive metabolites, N-acetyl-p-
benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) and tricholoromethyl radical (·CCl3), respectively.AlOHin
turn is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to its reactive metabolite, acrolein.
The glutathione adductof acrolein is converted by CYPs to glycidaldehyde. Toxicity
resulting from these reactive metabolites is multifactorial and includes lipid peroxidation,
generation of oxidative stress, altered cellular redox status and protein adduct
formation(Burcham & Fontaine, 2001; Cohen et al., 1997; Jaeschke et al., 2012; Ohno et al.,
1985; Tom et al., 1984). During cholestasis resulting from either BDL or ANIT treatment,
increase in bile acid concentration stimulates production of reactive oxygen species
eventually leading to hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis (Sokol et al., 1995; Trauner et
al., 1998).
The role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) role as a master defense against
hepatotoxicity produced by various chemicals has been investigated in several studies. Nrf2
belongs to the cap ‘n’ collar family of transcription factors that promotes transcription of a
battery of cytoprotective genes(Aleksunes & Manautou, 2007; Kensler et al., 2007). Under

basal conditions, Nrf2 is largely bound to the cytoskeletal anchoring protein Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) also known as cytosolic Nrf2 inhibitor in the
cytoplasm.In response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 andtranslocatesto the
nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to the GTGACA***GC core sequence of the antioxidant
response element (ARE) (Rushmore et al., 1991) and promotes ARE-mediated antioxidant
gene expression.
A low toxic APAP dose causes nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in mouse liver, which is
accompanied by increased expression of Nrf2 dependent cytoprotectivegenes such as heme
oxygenase-1 (Hmox1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1) and glutamate cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) (Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Bauer et al.,
2000; Chiu et al., 2002; Goldring et al., 2004). Similar results have been reported with
ANIT, BDL, CCl4 and AlOH, other models of hepatic oxidative stress used in the present
study(Aleksunes et al., 2005; Aleksunes et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Randle et al., 2008;
Tanaka et al., 2009). On the other hand, Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to 
APAP-induced liver injury compared to their wild-type counterparts (Chan et al., 2001; Enomoto et
al., 2001). Likewise, Nrf2 KO mice arealso more susceptible to CCl4- andAlOH-induced
hepatoxicity compared towild-type mice (Liu et al., 2013). However, Nrf2 KO mice do not
exhibit any difference in susceptibility to either BDL or ANIT treatment(Tanaka et al., 2009;
Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012). This response is attributed to the adaptive compensatory
changesinvolving nuclear transcription factors, including Fxr, Shp, Pxr andHnf1α, efflux
bile acid transporters, altered GSH levels and bile flow rates in Nrf2 KO mice (Tanaka et al.,
2009; Weerachayaphorn et al., 2012). Collectively, the models of hepatic injury selected for
the current study not only result in hepatic oxidative stress but also activate the Nrf2-Keap1
regulatory pathway.
Despite Fmo3 being considered non-inducible, studies with aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) agonists in mice revealed liver Fmo3 gene induction (Celius et al., 2008; Celius et al.,
2010). A recent gene array analysis performed in our laboratory also demonstrated Fmo3
gene induction in the APAP autoprotection mouse model (mice receiving a low hepatotoxic
APAP dose that become resistant to a subsequent higher APAP dose)(O'Connor et al.,
2014).Unlike with AhR agonists that result in marginal increases in Fmo3 protein expression
in mouse liver, we showed significant increases in Fmo3 protein levels by 15-fold in APAP
autoprotectedmice(Rudraiah et al., 2014). Fmo3 induction by other hepatotoxicants that
produce oxidative stress is not currently known.
In human liver, transcription factors regulating constitutive FMO3expression as well as
those involved in developmental expression pattern have been extensively studied (Klick &
Hines, 2007; Klick et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2008). Because the mammalian FMOs were
considered non-inducible by xenobiotics (Cashman & Zhang, 2002; Krueger & Williams,
2005), the transcriptional regulation of FMO involving stress-activated transcription
factorsor receptors that bind ligands andinteract with DNAwas not studied as other forms of
regulation. Thus, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of Fmo3 in response to
toxicant exposure. Recently, Celius et al. (2010) showed that the Fmo3 mRNA up-regulation
by 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) but not TCDD in Hepa-1 cells is

mediated by p53 and its binding to a p53-response element in the promoter region of
Fmo3(Celius et al., 2010).
Differentially expressed genes in the APAP autoprotection model were further analyzed
usingCausal Reasoning Engine (CRE), a recently developed computational platform
(O'Connor et al., 2014). CRE analysis provides hypotheses on the upstream molecular
events that best explain gene expression profiles based on prior biological knowledge. CRE
analysis of differentially expressed genes in APAP autoprotection study supportsan
induction of the Nrf2 pathway (O'Connor et al., 2014). Additionally, the 5'-flanking region
of the mouse Fmo3 contains multiple copies of the ARE (Celius et al., 2008). Therefore, the
purpose of the present study was to investigate liver Fmo3gene expression under oxidative
stress conditions involving activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 regulatory pathway. Mice were
dosed with hepatotoxicants APAP(400 mg/kg, 24 to 48h), ANIT (50 mg/kg, 2 to 48h),
CCl4(10 or 30 μL/kg, 24 and 48h) or AlOH (30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24h)orunderwent sham
surgery or bile duct ligation (10d). Doses selected for hepatotoxicants are based upon
previous studies conducted in our laboratory resulting in oxidative stress and tissue injury.
The inclusion of multiple time-points followinghepatotoxicantsexposure enabled
comprehensive characterization of temporal changes in Fmo3 in relation to injury and
recovery. Further, in order to investigate whether Nrf2 mediatesFmo3 gene expression, Nrf2
KO mice were employed. APAP was used as a model toxicant in the Nrf2 KO mice study.
From these experiments,it is concluded that not all hepatotoxicantsthat produce oxidative
stress in mice induce liver Fmo3 gene expression. Toxic ANIT treatment, along with the
previously demonstrated APAP treatment, markedly increases Fmo3 gene expression. While
BDL increases Fmo3 mRNA expression, protein levels do not change.APAP treatment
induces Fmo3 gene expression in Nrf2 KO mice liver suggesting that the transcriptional
regulation of Fmo3 might not involve Nrf2.
