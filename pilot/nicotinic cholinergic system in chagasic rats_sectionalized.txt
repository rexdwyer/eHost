Conclusions
Our results support the hypothesis that cholinergic
dysfunction in Chagas disease is the result of a combined
disruption of the vagal transmission and trophic 
remodeling of intracardiac neurons and receptors. The importance
of our findings is to demonstrated that alterations in
cardiac nicotinic cholinergic transmission is present in
Chagas disease in an early phase of cardiomyopathy 
evolution, before a dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive
heart failure will be installed. Therefore cardiac nicotinic
cholinergic functionality could be useful as prognostic
marker of the disease.

Methods
All drugs and chemicals were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich Co (St. Louis, MO, USA) and prepared as mg/ml
or M stocks solution by dissolving the drugs in purified
Page 2 of 9
deionized water. Stocks solutions were alliquoted and
stored at 5°C until use.
Animal model
All experiments were carried out on 54 Sprague Dawley
rats, randomly distributed according to the experiment: 16
(8 healthy and 8 chagasic rats) for the whole animal
experiments, 15 (8 healthy and 7 chagasic) were treated
with reserpine, and 23 (11 healthy and 12 chagasic) were
used in vagal stimulation and isolated beating heart
experiments. The MHOM/VE/92/2-92-YBM 
trypomasti-gotes strain was used to induce infection. Experimental
animal (i.e., rats) were inoculated with 1.000 
trypomasti-gotes per gram of body weight (chagasic group). Chagasic
animals develop an acute disease with a parasitemia peak
of 67.27 ± 25.05 × 106 parasites/ml at the third week of 
infection. At the time of performing the experiments, the
animals had 7.84 ± 0.45 months-old, weighted 504.9 ±
10.74 and 418.5 ± 15.10 grs for healthy and chagasic rats,
respectively; and only two chagasic animals displayed 
parasites in a blood sample, giving a parasitemia of 114.9 ±
84.43 parasites/ml. Animals were individually housed in a
temperature-controlled environment with a 12:12 light/
dark cycle and free access to food and water. Experimental
protocols were approved by the ethical committee of the
School of Health Sciences following the American
Physiological Society guidelines.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
The animals were anesthetized using a pentobarbital
(20-40 mg/Kg) and ketamine (50 mg/Kg) cocktail 
administered intraperitoneally. The animals’ respiration was 
mechanically aided through a tracheal cannula connected to a
volume-controlled rodent respirator at a frequency of 70
strokes/min to facilitate ventilation in spontaneously
breathing rat. The cervical vagus nerve was exposed 
bilaterally and severed at the caudal terminus. Platinum bipolar
electrodes were attached to the nerves ending leading 
toward the heart. The electrodes were connected to a
PowerLab/8sp system to generate frequency of heart
pacing . During the experiments performance, the electric
pulses were modified according to the protocol. Impulses
were delivered either at a fixed frequency (1.5 Hz) but 
different potency ranges (0.25 to 3 V) or in a range of 
frequencies (1-4 Hz) but fixed potency (2 V). All experiments
were performed in the absence and presence of 0.3 mg/Kg
physostigmine.
Isolated beating-heart system
The animals were anesthetized as described above and the
hearts removed under aseptic conditions. The isolated
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
hearts were connected to a Langendorff’s perfusion system
by cannulation of the aorta. The hearts were perfused with
a tepid (37°C) modified physiological solution (pH 7.40
± 0.05), aerated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 mixture. 
Perfusion was conducted at a rate of 7-10 mL/min 
maintaining a pressure range of 50 to 100 mmHg. The perfusion
solution composition included 10 mM glucose, 1 mM
MgSO4, 116 mM NaCl, 18 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM CaCl2,
5 mM KCl, and 1 mM malate.
To evaluate the effect of nicotine stimulation on the
chagasic and control hearts’ rate, the isolated hearts were
perfused, for 5 minutes, with 1, 10 or 100 μM of nicotine.
The heart preparations were allowed a 10 min rest period
between doses - maintaining perfusion with modified
physiological solution. The effect of the following nAChRs’
antagonists, on the isolated hearts’ rate, was evaluated:
1 μM mecamylamine (MA, α3/β4 nAChR antagonist),
10 nM dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE; α4/β2 nAChR 
an-tagonist), and 1 nM α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT; α7 nAChR
antagonist) [15]. The antagonists were administered in the
perfusion solution for 10 minutes, in the absence of 
nicotine, and for additionally 5 minutes in the presence of
10 μM nicotine. The preparations were allowed a 10 
minutes resting period - perfusion with modified 
physiological solution - between antagonists administration.
EKG recording
In the VNS experiments, the hearts’ electric activity was
monitored using needle electrodes placed subcutaneously
on the sternum xiphoid process and on both shoulders −
the left shoulder electrode served as reference electrode.
In the isolated heart preparations, the positive electrode
was inserted into the heart’s apex and the negative 
electrode into the right atrium. Analogical EKG signals were
amplified using BioAmp, transformed in digital signals by
Power Lab 8 data acquisition unit, recorded and analyzed
using Lab Chart software (ADInstruments).
Data analysis
Data are expressed either as mean of absolute values ±
SEM or normalized to be expresed as percentages ±
SEM. Paired and non-paired Student’s t-test were used to
analyze the effect of a drug on a particular group in
matched observations or when a variable for the control
group was compared with the same variable of the T cruzi
infected group, respectively. Repeated measure analysis of
variance (rANOVA) followed by a Dunnet’s post-test were
peformed to determine the statistical significance of drug
concentration and time effect per group. In all analyses, a
p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Statistical analysis were performed using the GraphPad Prism
4 for Windows software (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla,
CA).

Electrophysiological and pharmacological
evaluation of the nicotinic cholinergic system in
chagasic rats

Abstract
Background: Two theories attempt to explain the changes observed in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs) in chagasic cardiomyopathy. The neurogenic theory proposes that receptor changes are due to loss of
intracardiac ganglia parasympathetic neurons. The immunogenic theory proposes that the nAChRs changes are the
result of autoantibodies against these receptors. Both theories agreed that nAChRs functional expression could be
impaired in Chagas disease.
Methods: We evaluated nAChRs functional integrity in 54 Sprague Dawley rats, divided in two groups: healthy and
chronic chagasic rats. Rats were subjected to electrocardiographic studies in the whole animal under pentobarbital
anesthesia, by isolation and stimulation of vagus nerves and in isolated beating hearts (Langendorff’s preparation).
Results: Nicotine, 10 μM, induced a significant bradycardia in both groups. However, rats that had previously
received reserpine did not respond to nicotine stimulation. β-adrenergic stimulation, followed by nicotine
treatment, induced tachycardia in chagasic rats; while inducing bradycardia in healthy rats. Bilateral vagus nerve
stimulation induced a significantly higher level of bradycardia in healthy rats, compared to chagasic rats;
physostigmine potentiated the bradycardic response to vagal stimulation in both experimental groups. Electric
stimulation (e.g., ≥ 2 Hz), in the presence of physostigmine, produced a comparable vagal response in both groups.
In isolated beating-heart preparations 1 μM nicotine induced sustained bradycardia in healthy hearts while inducing
tachycardia in chagasic hearts. Higher nicotine doses (e.g.,10 - 100 uM) promoted the characteristic biphasic
response (i.e., bradycardia followed by tachycardia) in both groups. 10 nM DHβE antagonized the effect of 10 μM
nicotine, unmasking the cholinergic bradycardic effect in healthy rats only. 1 nM α-BGT alone induced bradycardia
in healthy hearts but antagonized the 10 μM nicotine-induced tachycardia in chagasic rats. In healthy but not in
chagasic hearts, 10 μM nicotine shortened PQ and PR interval, an effect counteracted by MA, DHβE and αBGT
Conclusion: Our results suggest that cholinergic function is impaired in chronic Chagas disease in rats, a
phenomena that could be related to alteration on the nAChR expression.

Background
Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosome cruzi (T cruzi), is
considered a serious public health problem in Central and
South America countries [1]. In Venezuela, approximately
4 million people are at risk to develop Chagas disease [2].
The chagasic chronic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most
common complication of this disease; approximately 
25-30% of infected patients developed CCC [1].
Although the CCC pathogenesis is not completely
understood, two theories attempt to explain it: the
neurogenic theory postulates that CCC is the result of
myocardial denervation. During the acute phase of the 
disease, T cruzi’s invasion of the myocardium results in a
selective, mechanical destruction of the intracardiac 
post-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons. The destruction of
the parasympathetic neurons allows for a sustained 
non-counteracted sympathetic tone; this unbalanced 
sympathetic stimulation initiates trophic changes that result in
the myocardial remodeling that culminates in arrhythmias
and heart failure [3].
The immunogenic theory explains the CCC pathogenesis
as the result of an aberrant immune response that includes
loss of self-tolerance and the development of cross-reacting
antibodies. Due to molecular mimicry, cross-reacting 
antibodies bind and neutralize surface receptors such as
nAChRs. These cross-reacting antibodies (i.e., 
autoanti-bodies) affect the activity and number of those receptors
population [4-7].
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are 
penta-meric, ligand-gated ion channels, formed by α and β 
subunits. Eight α subunits (α2- α7, α9, α10) and three β subunits
(β2-β4) have been described; the combination of these 
subunits produces a wide variety of functional receptors [8].
Intracardiac ganglion neurons can express α2 to α9 and β2
to β4 subunits, assembled predominantly as α3/β2, α3/β4,
α3/β2/β4, α3/β2/α5, α3/β4/α5, and monomeric α7. For
example, the canine intracardiac ganglion expresses
predominately α3/β2 nAChRs, with a smaller levels of α7
nAChRs [9-12].
Both neurogenic and immunogenic theories propose
alterations in the function of the cholinergic system.
Recently, our group demonstrated the existence of trophic
and functional disturbances of the muscarinic cholinergic
receptor system on in vivo and in vitro rats’ models of
Chagas disease [13,14]. In the present study, we analyzed
the functionality of the nAChRs in the whole animal and in
isolated beating-heart preparations, of healthy and chagasic
Sprague Dawley rats.

Results
EKG study in intact animals
The significant bradycardia induced by 10 μM nicotine, in
healthy and chagasic rats, was reverted by 0.1 μM
d-tubocurarine (Figures 1A and 1C). Lower 
concentrations of nicotine appear to have no effect on the heart rate
of the animals.
In order to determine whether the catecholaminergic
neurons were involved in the bradycardic response, the 
synaptic amine content was depleted with reserpine (1 mg/Kg/
day for three days) in both control and chagasic animals. It
was observed that reserpine-treated animals (both groups)
had a lower basal heart rate and nicotine was unable to 
induce bradycardia (Figure 1B and 1D).
When adrenergic tone was enhanced (0.01 mg/Kg of
isoproterenol), a similar tachycardic response (p = 0.14)
was induced in both animals groups (i.e., 117.2% ± 1.54 in
the healthy group and 120.6% ± 1.68 in the chagasic rats).
After administration of 10 uM of nicotine, we observed
that nicotine induced bradycardia in the healthy group
while, surprisingly, inducing a significant tachycardia in
the chagasic animals (Figure 2).
NVS study in intact animals
Stimulation of both vagus nerves induced a proportional
bradycardia to the frequency of the stimulus. However, the
bradycardic response was significantly higher in healthy
rats, compared with chagasic rats (Figure 3A). 
Physostigmine potentiated the bradycardic response, in both 
experimental groups; at low frequencies (1 and 1.5 Hz) the
bradycardic response was significantly higher in healthy
rats but, a higher frequencies (2 to 4 Hz) bradycardia was
similar in both groups (Figure 3B).
Likewise, at low frequency stimulation (1.5 Hz), a 
significant bradycardic response was elicited as the voltage 
intensity increased above 0.5 V. A significant difference between
the groups was observed at 3 V when the vagus nerves’
data were analyzed together (Figure 3C). Physostigmine
potentiated the bradycardic response, with the resulting
response significantly higher, at 2 and 2.5 V, for healthy rats
compared with chagasic rats (Figure 3D).
Isolated beating-hearts study
Heart rate
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of nicotine on the heart rate of
healthy and chagasic hearts. Nicotine (1 μM) slow-down
the heart rate for 150 sec in healthy hearts (-4.9 ± 2.1%;
p < 0.05), while in the chagasic hearts induced a transient
but non-significant, decrease on the hearts rate (20 s), 
followed by a significant tachycardia (+2.6 ± 1%, p <0.05) (see
Figure 4A). The response of healthy and chagasic hearts to
10 μM nicotine stimulation (Figure 4B) was comparable to
that induced by 1 μM nicotine in the chagasic hearts. 
Initially, 10 μM nicotine induced a non-significant bradycardia

(-2 ± 1.5%, p> 0.05) that was followed by a significant
tachycardia (+5.8 ± 3.5% in healthy group; +4 ± 1.9% in
chagasic group. p <0.05). The effect of 100 μM nicotine
was similar to that induced by 10 μM nicotine in both
groups.
In the absence of nicotine stimulation, healthy hearts 
response to MA was a slight but significant (p< 0.05) 
bradycardia (2.24 to 2.92%). Chagasic hearts response to MA
was non-significant. However, 1 μM MA abrogated the
tachycardia elicited by 10 μM nicotine, in both, healthy
and chagasic hearts.
Figure 5A shows that on healthy hearts α-BGT (full 
cir-cles) induced a significant bradycardia (-6.8 ± 3.1%;
p <0.05); however, in the presence of 10 μM nicotine
(open squares) α-BGT blocked the nicotine-induced 
tachycardia. Figure 5B shows that the α-BGT, by itself, had no
effect on chagasic hearts’ heart rate (full circles), but
effectively blocked the nicotine-induced tachycardia (open
squares).
In healthy hearts 10 nM DHβE, by itself, failed to induce
a significant tachycardia (p > 0.05); however, in the
presence of nicotine (10 μM), DHβE induced a significant
(p < 0.05) bradycardia (Figure 5C). The chagasic hearts
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
response to DHβE stimulation alone was a delayed 
bradycardia (i.e., 10 min after stimulation). In the presence of
nicotine, the delayed was abrogated (Figure 5D) and the
response was comparable to that observed in the healthy
hearts group.
PQ and PR intervals
Chagasic hearts had significantly prolonged PQ and PR
intervals when compared to healthy hearts (healthy Rats:
PQ = 46.82 ± 2.49 and PR: 53.70 ± 2.37 ms; chagasic rats:
PQ = 54.17 ± 2.55 and PR = 61.92 ± 2.48 ms; p = 0.049
and 0.041, respectively). The PQ interval in healthy hearts
was significantly decreased by nicotine 10 μM, during the
desensitized period (5 min), an effect that was antagonized
by MA, DHβE and α-BGT. No significant effect in 
chagasic hearts in the PQ interval was observed. Similar effects
were observed for the PR intervals. When healthy and
chagasic hearts were compared in a particular protocol

Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
variable, we observed significant differences with 10 μM
nicotine during the desensitizing period, 100 μM nicotine
during the activation period, DHβE and αBGT (Table 1).
QT and QTc intervals
No significant effects on either of the intervals were
observed when healthy and chagasic hearts were
compared. Furthermore, we did not observe any 
significant effect of nicotine on both intervals; however, in 
chagasic hearts with the addition of 10 μM nicotine
(activation period), DHβE and α-BGT significantly
increased the QTc interval when compared to nicotine
only. When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in
a particular protocol variable we observed significant 
differences with 10 μM nicotine during the desensitizing
period and DHβE.
T and QRS amplitude
QRS amplitude was higher in healthy hearts when 
compared with chagasic hearts (HR: 709 ± 103.8 μV; CH: 462.1
± 62.53 μV; p = 0.05). In healthy hearts, 10 μM nicotine in
the presence of MA and DHβE only, induced a 
significantly decrease of the QRS amplitude; while in chagasic
hearts 1 μM nicotine and 10 μM nicotine in the presence
of DHβE induced a significant decrease of QRS amplitude.
When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in a 
particular protocol variable we observed significant differences
with 100 μM nicotine during the desensitizing period and
DHβE.
No differences for the T wave amplitude were observed
between healthy and chagasic hearts. In healthy and 
chagasic hearts nicotine 10 μM in addition to DHβE induced
a significant decrease of the T amplitude during the 
desensitizing period. When healthy and chagasic hearts were
compared in a particular protocol variable we observed
significant differences with 10 μM nicotine in addition to
MA during the desensitizing period.
Perfusion pressure
In healthy and chagasic hearts 10 μM nicotine induced a
significant increases of the pressure wave amplitude during
the activation period, an effect that was blocked by MA
and DHβE in healthy hearts and by MA, DHβE and αBGT
in chagasic hearts. The use of 100 μM nicotine also
induced an increase of the pressure wave amplitude during
the activation period in healthy hearts but not in chagasic
ones. When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in
a particular protocol variable we observed significant 
differences with 10 μM nicotine in addition to αBGT during
activation and desensitizing periods (Table 1).

functional integrity of the nicotinic cholinergic system in

rats with chronic chagasic disease, using 
electrophysio-logical tools. We were able to determine that rats with
Chagas disease have a dysfunction of nicotinic 
cholinergic system when compared with healthy rats.
In our whole-animal model, nicotine induced 
bradycardia, an effect that could be mediated by the simultaneous
activation of the post-synaptic autonomic neurons and 
inhibition of adrenergic pre-synaptic terminals innervating
the heart. The inhibition of the adrenergic response most
likely is mediated by M2 muscarinic AChRs. M2-mediated
inhibitory effect has been demonstrated in guinea pig,
where muscarinic agonists reduced norepinephrine 
overflow, in a concentration-dependent manner, and such 
effect was selectively antagonized by the M2-specific
antagonist AF-DX-116 [16].
The tachycardia induced by nicotine, in the presence of
isoproterenol, indicates an impairment in the vasovagal 
reflex in chagasic rats. Isoproterenol increases the systolic
pressure, due to the increment on heart rate and ejection
fraction. The damaged cholinergic parasympathetic 
efferents favored a post-synaptic β-adrenergic dominance over
Page 7 of 9
the heart rate. This observation was consistent with reports
that, in rats, phenylephrine-induced bradycardia was 
diminished in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease as well
as in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy [14].
Direct stimulation of the vagus nerve, in rats with chronic
Chagas disease, decreased the bradycardic response as a
function of stimuli frequency and intensity, indicating a
reduced vagal function in chagasic rats. The importance of
the vagus nerve’s functional integrity has been documented
in rats with acute chagasic myocarditis using direct vagal
stimulation [17]. In these studies, the chronotropic
response to stimulation, with low frequencies pulses, was
significantly different between chagasic rats and healthy
rats. These groups have comparable chronotropic response
to higher frequency stimuli suggesting decrease in the
fibers’ excitability and change in their response threshold in
chagasic rats, due to acute nerve inflammation.
In Chagas disease, the diminished cholinergic function
has been explained as a direct consequence of the 
presence of autoantibodies against both types of AChRs
(i.e., nicotinic and muscarinic receptors). The chronic
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
binding of these autoantibodies to the nAChR could 
induce a decrease in the population of functional nAChRs
and consequently contribute to the alterations described
in the course of chronic Chagas' disease [6,7]. In our
experiments, we observed that when physostigmine, a well
known acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor, was administered at
the same time of high frequencies stimuli, the vagal 
response was restored. By mass-action law, a high level of
synaptic acetylcholine would competitively displace the
autoantibodies from the receptor sites.
In our isolated beating-heart model, nicotine stimulation
induced the classic biphasic heart rate, which has been
described for both nicotine and other non-selective AChR
agonists [18-21]. However, our study demonstrated the
nicotine-induced effect was dose-dependent. While 1 μM
nicotine induced a bradycardia only, 100 μM of nicotine
induced a biphasic effect in control rats. These differential
responses were blocked by 1 μM mecamylamine, 
indicating that the action of nicotine used the ganglionic α3β4
nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling.
The need of an intact ganglionic transmission has been
demonstrated on elegant studies using hexamethonium.
This ganglionic nAChR antagonist blocked the 
nicotine-induced biphasic heart rate [10,19-21]. However, the exact
nAChR population involved in the nicotine-induced
bradycardia has not been identified. Successful blockade of
nicotine-induced bradycardia by α-BGT suggest that α7
nAChR subtype could be involved in the biphasic 
heart-rate response to nicotine stimulation [19]. Involvement of
other nAChR subtypes or even the contribution of specific
subunits cannot be ignored. nAChR with high affinity for
nicotine are preferentially formed by α2, α4 and β2 
subunits [22-24]. α2β2 and α4β2 receptors have been described
to be expressed on intracardiac neurons [9]. DHβE, an
α4β2 nAChR selective antagonist, prevented 
nicotine-induced bradycardia, while a selective agonist (RJR2403)
reproduced the nicotine effect [20,21]. Cytisine, a selective
β4 subunit agonist, and metillycaconitine (selective α7 
antagonist) have opposites effect on the heart rate [19-21].
Our results indicated that pre-synaptic α7 nAChRs are
involved in the nicotine-induced tachycardic phase as it
was blocked by α-BGT. The bradycardic response to
α-BGT perfused alone suggested that α7 subunit is also
present in nAChR intrinsic adrenergic neurons. Recent
studies have found that autonomic dysfunction; especially
a decrease of vagal activity, is related to worsening of 
cardiovascular diseases. Autonomic imbalance with increased
adrenergic and reduced parasympathetic activity is
involved in the development and progress of heart failure
(HF) [25]. M2-AChR knockout mice exhibit impaired 
ventricular function and increased susceptibility to cardiac
stress, suggesting a protective role of the parasympathetic
nervous system in the heart [26]. Furthermore, vagal
stimulation has been shown to be beneficial in cases of
Page 8 of 9
heart failure, because it inhibited cardiac remodeling 
associated with heart dysfunction [27,28].
Our results suggest that nicotinic receptors are involved
in the regulation of electrical transmission between sinusal
and AV nodes, however chagasic hearts have lost this 
capability because nicotine was unable to shorten PQ and PR
intervals in them, indicating a disregulation of nicotinic
receptors in these structures. Indeed a lost of nicotinic
receptors could explain a prolongued PQ and PR intervals
observed in chagasic hearts in basal conditions.
The increase of perfusion pressure wave induced by
nicotine in both groups reflects a positive inotropic effect
of the agonist acting on nicotinic receptors. It has been
already reported that nicotine produced a 
concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect on electrical evoked
contraction of isolated toad ventricle [29].
Conclusions
Our results support the hypothesis that cholinergic
dysfunction in Chagas disease is the result of a combined
disruption of the vagal transmission and trophic 
remodeling of intracardiac neurons and receptors. The importance
of our findings is to demonstrated that alterations in
cardiac nicotinic cholinergic transmission is present in
Chagas disease in an early phase of cardiomyopathy 
evolution, before a dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive
heart failure will be installed. Therefore cardiac nicotinic
cholinergic functionality could be useful as prognostic
marker of the disease.

Abstract
Background: Two theories attempt to explain the changes observed in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs) in chagasic cardiomyopathy. The neurogenic theory proposes that receptor changes are due to loss of
intracardiac ganglia parasympathetic neurons. The immunogenic theory proposes that the nAChRs changes are the
result of autoantibodies against these receptors. Both theories agreed that nAChRs functional expression could be
impaired in Chagas disease.
Methods: We evaluated nAChRs functional integrity in 54 Sprague Dawley rats, divided in two groups: healthy and
chronic chagasic rats. Rats were subjected to electrocardiographic studies in the whole animal under pentobarbital
anesthesia, by isolation and stimulation of vagus nerves and in isolated beating hearts (Langendorff’s preparation).
Results: Nicotine, 10 μM, induced a significant bradycardia in both groups. However, rats that had previously
received reserpine did not respond to nicotine stimulation. β-adrenergic stimulation, followed by nicotine
treatment, induced tachycardia in chagasic rats; while inducing bradycardia in healthy rats. Bilateral vagus nerve
stimulation induced a significantly higher level of bradycardia in healthy rats, compared to chagasic rats;
physostigmine potentiated the bradycardic response to vagal stimulation in both experimental groups. Electric
stimulation (e.g., ≥ 2 Hz), in the presence of physostigmine, produced a comparable vagal response in both groups.
In isolated beating-heart preparations 1 μM nicotine induced sustained bradycardia in healthy hearts while inducing
tachycardia in chagasic hearts. Higher nicotine doses (e.g.,10 - 100 uM) promoted the characteristic biphasic
response (i.e., bradycardia followed by tachycardia) in both groups. 10 nM DHβE antagonized the effect of 10 μM
nicotine, unmasking the cholinergic bradycardic effect in healthy rats only. 1 nM α-BGT alone induced bradycardia
in healthy hearts but antagonized the 10 μM nicotine-induced tachycardia in chagasic rats. In healthy but not in
chagasic hearts, 10 μM nicotine shortened PQ and PR interval, an effect counteracted by MA, DHβE and αBGT
Conclusion: Our results suggest that cholinergic function is impaired in chronic Chagas disease in rats, a
phenomena that could be related to alteration on the nAChR expression.

Background
Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosome cruzi (T cruzi), is
considered a serious public health problem in Central and
South America countries [1]. In Venezuela, approximately
4 million people are at risk to develop Chagas disease [2].
The chagasic chronic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most
common complication of this disease; approximately 
25-30% of infected patients developed CCC [1].
Although the CCC pathogenesis is not completely
understood, two theories attempt to explain it: the
neurogenic theory postulates that CCC is the result of
myocardial denervation. During the acute phase of the 
disease, T cruzi’s invasion of the myocardium results in a
selective, mechanical destruction of the intracardiac 
post-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons. The destruction of
the parasympathetic neurons allows for a sustained 
non-counteracted sympathetic tone; this unbalanced 
sympathetic stimulation initiates trophic changes that result in
the myocardial remodeling that culminates in arrhythmias
and heart failure [3].
The immunogenic theory explains the CCC pathogenesis
as the result of an aberrant immune response that includes
loss of self-tolerance and the development of cross-reacting
antibodies. Due to molecular mimicry, cross-reacting 
antibodies bind and neutralize surface receptors such as
nAChRs. These cross-reacting antibodies (i.e., 
autoanti-bodies) affect the activity and number of those receptors
population [4-7].
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are 
penta-meric, ligand-gated ion channels, formed by α and β 
subunits. Eight α subunits (α2- α7, α9, α10) and three β subunits
(β2-β4) have been described; the combination of these 
subunits produces a wide variety of functional receptors [8].
Intracardiac ganglion neurons can express α2 to α9 and β2
to β4 subunits, assembled predominantly as α3/β2, α3/β4,
α3/β2/β4, α3/β2/α5, α3/β4/α5, and monomeric α7. For
example, the canine intracardiac ganglion expresses
predominately α3/β2 nAChRs, with a smaller levels of α7
nAChRs [9-12].
Both neurogenic and immunogenic theories propose
alterations in the function of the cholinergic system.
Recently, our group demonstrated the existence of trophic
and functional disturbances of the muscarinic cholinergic
receptor system on in vivo and in vitro rats’ models of
Chagas disease [13,14]. In the present study, we analyzed
the functionality of the nAChRs in the whole animal and in
isolated beating-heart preparations, of healthy and chagasic
Sprague Dawley rats.

rats with chronic chagasic disease, using 
electrophysio-logical tools. We were able to determine that rats with
Chagas disease have a dysfunction of nicotinic 
cholinergic system when compared with healthy rats.
In our whole-animal model, nicotine induced 
bradycardia, an effect that could be mediated by the simultaneous
activation of the post-synaptic autonomic neurons and 
inhibition of adrenergic pre-synaptic terminals innervating
the heart. The inhibition of the adrenergic response most
likely is mediated by M2 muscarinic AChRs. M2-mediated
inhibitory effect has been demonstrated in guinea pig,
where muscarinic agonists reduced norepinephrine 
overflow, in a concentration-dependent manner, and such 
effect was selectively antagonized by the M2-specific
antagonist AF-DX-116 [16].
The tachycardia induced by nicotine, in the presence of
isoproterenol, indicates an impairment in the vasovagal 
reflex in chagasic rats. Isoproterenol increases the systolic
pressure, due to the increment on heart rate and ejection
fraction. The damaged cholinergic parasympathetic 
efferents favored a post-synaptic β-adrenergic dominance over
Page 7 of 9
the heart rate. This observation was consistent with reports
that, in rats, phenylephrine-induced bradycardia was 
diminished in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease as well
as in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy [14].
Direct stimulation of the vagus nerve, in rats with chronic
Chagas disease, decreased the bradycardic response as a
function of stimuli frequency and intensity, indicating a
reduced vagal function in chagasic rats. The importance of
the vagus nerve’s functional integrity has been documented
in rats with acute chagasic myocarditis using direct vagal
stimulation [17]. In these studies, the chronotropic
response to stimulation, with low frequencies pulses, was
significantly different between chagasic rats and healthy
rats. These groups have comparable chronotropic response
to higher frequency stimuli suggesting decrease in the
fibers’ excitability and change in their response threshold in
chagasic rats, due to acute nerve inflammation.
In Chagas disease, the diminished cholinergic function
has been explained as a direct consequence of the 
presence of autoantibodies against both types of AChRs
(i.e., nicotinic and muscarinic receptors). The chronic
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
binding of these autoantibodies to the nAChR could 
induce a decrease in the population of functional nAChRs
and consequently contribute to the alterations described
in the course of chronic Chagas' disease [6,7]. In our
experiments, we observed that when physostigmine, a well
known acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor, was administered at
the same time of high frequencies stimuli, the vagal 
response was restored. By mass-action law, a high level of
synaptic acetylcholine would competitively displace the
autoantibodies from the receptor sites.
In our isolated beating-heart model, nicotine stimulation
induced the classic biphasic heart rate, which has been
described for both nicotine and other non-selective AChR
agonists [18-21]. However, our study demonstrated the
nicotine-induced effect was dose-dependent. While 1 μM
nicotine induced a bradycardia only, 100 μM of nicotine
induced a biphasic effect in control rats. These differential
responses were blocked by 1 μM mecamylamine, 
indicating that the action of nicotine used the ganglionic α3β4
nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling.
The need of an intact ganglionic transmission has been
demonstrated on elegant studies using hexamethonium.
This ganglionic nAChR antagonist blocked the 
nicotine-induced biphasic heart rate [10,19-21]. However, the exact
nAChR population involved in the nicotine-induced
bradycardia has not been identified. Successful blockade of
nicotine-induced bradycardia by α-BGT suggest that α7
nAChR subtype could be involved in the biphasic 
heart-rate response to nicotine stimulation [19]. Involvement of
other nAChR subtypes or even the contribution of specific
subunits cannot be ignored. nAChR with high affinity for
nicotine are preferentially formed by α2, α4 and β2 
subunits [22-24]. α2β2 and α4β2 receptors have been described
to be expressed on intracardiac neurons [9]. DHβE, an
α4β2 nAChR selective antagonist, prevented 
nicotine-induced bradycardia, while a selective agonist (RJR2403)
reproduced the nicotine effect [20,21]. Cytisine, a selective
β4 subunit agonist, and metillycaconitine (selective α7 
antagonist) have opposites effect on the heart rate [19-21].
Our results indicated that pre-synaptic α7 nAChRs are
involved in the nicotine-induced tachycardic phase as it
was blocked by α-BGT. The bradycardic response to
α-BGT perfused alone suggested that α7 subunit is also
present in nAChR intrinsic adrenergic neurons. Recent
studies have found that autonomic dysfunction; especially
a decrease of vagal activity, is related to worsening of 
cardiovascular diseases. Autonomic imbalance with increased
adrenergic and reduced parasympathetic activity is
involved in the development and progress of heart failure
(HF) [25]. M2-AChR knockout mice exhibit impaired 
ventricular function and increased susceptibility to cardiac
stress, suggesting a protective role of the parasympathetic
nervous system in the heart [26]. Furthermore, vagal
stimulation has been shown to be beneficial in cases of
Page 8 of 9
heart failure, because it inhibited cardiac remodeling 
associated with heart dysfunction [27,28].
Our results suggest that nicotinic receptors are involved
in the regulation of electrical transmission between sinusal
and AV nodes, however chagasic hearts have lost this 
capability because nicotine was unable to shorten PQ and PR
intervals in them, indicating a disregulation of nicotinic
receptors in these structures. Indeed a lost of nicotinic
receptors could explain a prolongued PQ and PR intervals
observed in chagasic hearts in basal conditions.
The increase of perfusion pressure wave induced by
nicotine in both groups reflects a positive inotropic effect
of the agonist acting on nicotinic receptors. It has been
already reported that nicotine produced a 
concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect on electrical evoked
contraction of isolated toad ventricle [29].

Results
EKG study in intact animals
The significant bradycardia induced by 10 μM nicotine, in
healthy and chagasic rats, was reverted by 0.1 μM
d-tubocurarine (Figures 1A and 1C). Lower 
concentrations of nicotine appear to have no effect on the heart rate
of the animals.
In order to determine whether the catecholaminergic
neurons were involved in the bradycardic response, the 
synaptic amine content was depleted with reserpine (1 mg/Kg/
day for three days) in both control and chagasic animals. It
was observed that reserpine-treated animals (both groups)
had a lower basal heart rate and nicotine was unable to 
induce bradycardia (Figure 1B and 1D).
When adrenergic tone was enhanced (0.01 mg/Kg of
isoproterenol), a similar tachycardic response (p = 0.14)
was induced in both animals groups (i.e., 117.2% ± 1.54 in
the healthy group and 120.6% ± 1.68 in the chagasic rats).
After administration of 10 uM of nicotine, we observed
that nicotine induced bradycardia in the healthy group
while, surprisingly, inducing a significant tachycardia in
the chagasic animals (Figure 2).
NVS study in intact animals
Stimulation of both vagus nerves induced a proportional
bradycardia to the frequency of the stimulus. However, the
bradycardic response was significantly higher in healthy
rats, compared with chagasic rats (Figure 3A). 
Physostigmine potentiated the bradycardic response, in both 
experimental groups; at low frequencies (1 and 1.5 Hz) the
bradycardic response was significantly higher in healthy
rats but, a higher frequencies (2 to 4 Hz) bradycardia was
similar in both groups (Figure 3B).
Likewise, at low frequency stimulation (1.5 Hz), a 
significant bradycardic response was elicited as the voltage 
intensity increased above 0.5 V. A significant difference between
the groups was observed at 3 V when the vagus nerves’
data were analyzed together (Figure 3C). Physostigmine
potentiated the bradycardic response, with the resulting
response significantly higher, at 2 and 2.5 V, for healthy rats
compared with chagasic rats (Figure 3D).
Isolated beating-hearts study
Heart rate
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of nicotine on the heart rate of
healthy and chagasic hearts. Nicotine (1 μM) slow-down
the heart rate for 150 sec in healthy hearts (-4.9 ± 2.1%;
p < 0.05), while in the chagasic hearts induced a transient
but non-significant, decrease on the hearts rate (20 s), 
followed by a significant tachycardia (+2.6 ± 1%, p <0.05) (see
Figure 4A). The response of healthy and chagasic hearts to
10 μM nicotine stimulation (Figure 4B) was comparable to
that induced by 1 μM nicotine in the chagasic hearts. 
Initially, 10 μM nicotine induced a non-significant bradycardia

(-2 ± 1.5%, p> 0.05) that was followed by a significant
tachycardia (+5.8 ± 3.5% in healthy group; +4 ± 1.9% in
chagasic group. p <0.05). The effect of 100 μM nicotine
was similar to that induced by 10 μM nicotine in both
groups.
In the absence of nicotine stimulation, healthy hearts 
response to MA was a slight but significant (p< 0.05) 
bradycardia (2.24 to 2.92%). Chagasic hearts response to MA
was non-significant. However, 1 μM MA abrogated the
tachycardia elicited by 10 μM nicotine, in both, healthy
and chagasic hearts.
Figure 5A shows that on healthy hearts α-BGT (full 
cir-cles) induced a significant bradycardia (-6.8 ± 3.1%;
p <0.05); however, in the presence of 10 μM nicotine
(open squares) α-BGT blocked the nicotine-induced 
tachycardia. Figure 5B shows that the α-BGT, by itself, had no
effect on chagasic hearts’ heart rate (full circles), but
effectively blocked the nicotine-induced tachycardia (open
squares).
In healthy hearts 10 nM DHβE, by itself, failed to induce
a significant tachycardia (p > 0.05); however, in the
presence of nicotine (10 μM), DHβE induced a significant
(p < 0.05) bradycardia (Figure 5C). The chagasic hearts
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
response to DHβE stimulation alone was a delayed 
bradycardia (i.e., 10 min after stimulation). In the presence of
nicotine, the delayed was abrogated (Figure 5D) and the
response was comparable to that observed in the healthy
hearts group.
PQ and PR intervals
Chagasic hearts had significantly prolonged PQ and PR
intervals when compared to healthy hearts (healthy Rats:
PQ = 46.82 ± 2.49 and PR: 53.70 ± 2.37 ms; chagasic rats:
PQ = 54.17 ± 2.55 and PR = 61.92 ± 2.48 ms; p = 0.049
and 0.041, respectively). The PQ interval in healthy hearts
was significantly decreased by nicotine 10 μM, during the
desensitized period (5 min), an effect that was antagonized
by MA, DHβE and α-BGT. No significant effect in 
chagasic hearts in the PQ interval was observed. Similar effects
were observed for the PR intervals. When healthy and
chagasic hearts were compared in a particular protocol
Page 5 of 9
Bonfante-Cabarcas et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/1/2
variable, we observed significant differences with 10 μM
nicotine during the desensitizing period, 100 μM nicotine
during the activation period, DHβE and αBGT (Table 1).
QT and QTc intervals
No significant effects on either of the intervals were
observed when healthy and chagasic hearts were
compared. Furthermore, we did not observe any 
significant effect of nicotine on both intervals; however, in 
chagasic hearts with the addition of 10 μM nicotine
(activation period), DHβE and α-BGT significantly
increased the QTc interval when compared to nicotine
only. When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in
a particular protocol variable we observed significant 
differences with 10 μM nicotine during the desensitizing
period and DHβE.
T and QRS amplitude
QRS amplitude was higher in healthy hearts when 
compared with chagasic hearts (HR: 709 ± 103.8 μV; CH: 462.1
± 62.53 μV; p = 0.05). In healthy hearts, 10 μM nicotine in
the presence of MA and DHβE only, induced a 
significantly decrease of the QRS amplitude; while in chagasic
hearts 1 μM nicotine and 10 μM nicotine in the presence
of DHβE induced a significant decrease of QRS amplitude.
When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in a 
particular protocol variable we observed significant differences
with 100 μM nicotine during the desensitizing period and
DHβE.
No differences for the T wave amplitude were observed
between healthy and chagasic hearts. In healthy and 
chagasic hearts nicotine 10 μM in addition to DHβE induced
a significant decrease of the T amplitude during the 
desensitizing period. When healthy and chagasic hearts were
compared in a particular protocol variable we observed
significant differences with 10 μM nicotine in addition to
MA during the desensitizing period.
Perfusion pressure
In healthy and chagasic hearts 10 μM nicotine induced a
significant increases of the pressure wave amplitude during
the activation period, an effect that was blocked by MA
and DHβE in healthy hearts and by MA, DHβE and αBGT
in chagasic hearts. The use of 100 μM nicotine also
induced an increase of the pressure wave amplitude during
the activation period in healthy hearts but not in chagasic
ones. When healthy and chagasic hearts were compared in
a particular protocol variable we observed significant 
differences with 10 μM nicotine in addition to αBGT during
activation and desensitizing periods (Table 1).

Figure 1 Nicotine affects the heart rate of anesthetized whole-animals. 10 μM Nicotine (Nic) induced a significant bradycardic response, 
while 1 μM D-tubocurarine reversed it, in both healthy (A) and chagasic (C) rats. Lower doses of Nic (i.e., 1 μM) have no effect on the heart rate 
of these animals. EKG results from healthy (B) and chagasic (D) rats, treated daily with 1 mg/Kg of reserpine for 3 days, showed a significant
