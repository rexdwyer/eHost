Aims: The potential association of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) with the development of pancreatitis or pancreatic
malignancies in patients with diabetes has been suggested. This study evaluated the long-term effects of the GLP-1RA exenatide on pancreatic
exocrine structure and function in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model of type 2 diabetes.
Methods: Rats received subcutaneous twice-daily injections of 0 (control), 6, 40 and 250μg/kg/day exenatide for 3months. Clinical signs,
body and pancreas weight, food consumption, HbA1c, fasting serum amylase, lipase, glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated during
treatment and after a 28-day off-drug period to assess the reversibility of any observed effects. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic ductal cell
proliferation and apoptosis were performed.
Results: Plasma exenatide concentrations were several-fold higher than therapeutic levels observed in humans. No exenatide-related
effects were observed on clinical signs, lipase concentration, pancreatic weight, pancreatic histology, ductal cell proliferation or apoptosis.
Exenatide improved animal survival, physical condition, glucose concentrations and HbA1c, decreased food intake, and increased serum insulin
concentration. Total amylase concentrations, although within normal ranges, were slightly higher in exenatide-treated rats; following the
off-drug period, total amylase concentrations were comparable in treated and untreated rats. Exenatide-related minimal-to-moderate islet
hypertrophy was observed at doses ≥6μg/kg/day, with dose-related increases in incidence and degree. These changes were still present
after the off-drug period.
Conclusions: Chronic administration of exenatide in ZDF rats resulted in the expected metabolic benefits and improved animal survival, with
no adverse effects noted on pancreatic exocrine structure and function.

Introduction
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) 
represent a novel therapeutic class for the treatment of type 2
diabetes [1,2] and current treatment guidelines recommend
their use after metformin monotherapy fails to lower HbA1c
to targets levels [3]. Like GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitors are incretin-based therapies, but they are
administered orally. As their introduction into the marketplace,
an association with pancreatitis has been suggested for 
GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors, although such cases have been rare
[4-8]. Analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
(AERS) database has raised concerns about a potential increase
in pancreatitis with long-term use of GLP-1RA-based therapies
[9]. However, the authors of that paper - aware of limitations of
the incomplete and biased character of AERS - concluded that
their analysis of the FDA database did not establish that 
pancreatitis is caused by GLP-1RAs-based therapy [9]. Type 2 diabetes
and obesity themselves are risk factors for the development of
pancreatitis [10] and obesity increases pancreatitis intensity

and mortality rate [11], further complicating the assessment
of the potential association between GLP-1RA therapy and
occurrence of pancreatitis in patients with diabetes.
Investigation of the association between GLP-1RA use and
the development of potential adverse pancreatic effects has been
studied in several nonclinical studies with conflicting findings.
Nonclinical safety and mechanistic studies on exenatide twice
daily and exenatide once weekly conducted in rodents, dogs
and primates using different routes of administration (e.g.
intravenous, subcutaneous) and varying durations (e.g. single
dose to chronic, 2-year dosing) did not show pancreatitis based
on tests of pancreatic function or histomorphology. Exenatide
use in normal, obese and diabetic models did not exacerbate
experimental pancreatitis; conversely, it had beneficial actions
in some models [12,13]. More recent studies also failed to
show any adverse effects on the exocrine pancreas related to
exenatide or liraglutide (another GLP1-RA) use [14,15]. In
contrast, in two other studies using normal rats, subtle but
significant histological changes along with slight increases in
lipase but not amylase concentrations were described in one
study [16], and increased ductal cell proliferation without
changes in pancreatic enzymes was described in another
study [17]. Whether GLP-1 receptors are expressed in rodent
original article
or human acinar or ductal cells also remains controversial
[17-20]; therefore, it cannot be excluded that GLP-1 receptor
agonism might directly modulate the function of these cell
populations.
It was hypothesized that potential deleterious effects of 
GLP-1 agonism on the exocrine pancreas might be best observed
in diabetic animals, rather than healthy animals. The present
study was conducted to determine the potential chronic effects
of exenatide exposure on exocrine pancreatic structure and
function in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The study was carried out by an independent Contract Research
Organization in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice
regulations (21CFR58) and in accordance with applicable laws
regarding animal use in research. The ZDF rat was selected as
the test system in this study as it is an inbred rat model that,
through genetic mutation and a managed diet, closely mimics
human adult-onset type 2 diabetes and related complications
associated with insulin resistance and β-cell failure.
Male ZDF rats (ZDF/Crl-Lepfa; Charles River Kingston,
Stone Ridge, NY, USA) were housed individually (stainless steel
wire-mesh floor cages, automatic watering valve, temperature
19-25 ◦C, humidity 30-70%, 12:12-hour light cycle) and
acclimated for at least 21 days prior to treatment, which started
when animals were 8 weeks old. Animals were fed ad libitum
commercial laboratory diet (Purina Certified Rodent 5008
irradiated, PMI Nutrition International, LLC, Richmond, IN,
USA), except when overnight fasting was required for blood
sample collection.
Experimental Design
This study was performed as part of post-marketing request for
exenatide twice daily and the study design was reviewed by the
United States Food and Drug Administration. Animals were
randomly assigned to treatment groups using a 
computer-based randomization based on pretreatment amylase values
(Table 1).
Exenatide for injection (Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, San
Diego, CA, USA), which contains exenatide in diluents (purity
of 98.5%) was stored protected from light at 2-8 ◦C prior to use.
Sodium chloride for injection (0.9%, USP; Baxter Healthcare
Recovery animals were a subset of each treatment group. PK animals were used for pharmacokinetic evaluation only and were euthanized following their
last blood collection. BID, twice daily; SC, subcutaneous; PK, pharmacokinetics.
DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM
Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) was used as the vehicle
control. Samples of exenatide formulations were collected on
days 1, 22 and 50 and evaluated for exenatide concentration
and stability under conditions of use using a validated
size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SEC-
HPLC) method.
Animals were treated twice daily by subcutaneous injection
at approximately the same time each day for 91 consecutive
days. After completion of the treatment phase, a subset of
animals from each group was maintained, untreated, for a
28-day recovery period.
Clinical Observations
Animals were observed twice daily for signs of ill health
and/or reaction to treatment and mortality throughout the
study. A detailed examination was performed weekly beginning
2 weeks after arrival and throughout the treatment and recovery
periods. Individual body weights were measured for all animals
within 3 days of arrival, prior to randomization, and weekly
(including day 1 and prior to scheduled necropsy). Individual
food consumption (excluding animals used for PK analyses)
was measured weekly throughout the treatment and recovery
periods.
Clinical Chemistry
Animals were fasted overnight before scheduled blood sample
collection. Blood for serum glucose, insulin, amylase, lipase
and whole blood HbA1c was collected from anaesthetized
animals by jugular or tail venipuncture at baseline and during
the dosing and recovery periods on days 30, 60 and 90.
Serum glucose, amylase, lipase and whole blood HbA1c were
measured according to assay protocols (Modular Analytics,
Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Serum insulin was
assessed with insulin ELISA (LINCO Research Inc., Saint
Charles, MO, USA).
Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for plasma exenatide concentration were
collected on days 1 and 91 from a subsets of animals from groups
2-4, inclusively, within 15 min of dosing and after the first daily
dose thereafter, including the following time points: 5, 15 and
30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h (within 15 min of the second dose).
Samples were also collected from a subset of animals from group

1 at a single time point 15 min after the first daily dose on days 1
and 91. Samples were stored at−80 ◦C for further analyses using
a validated ELISA (Intertek dba ALTA Analytical Laboratory,
San Diego, CA, USA) [21]. Pharmacokinetic parameters were
estimated using WinNonlin pharmacokinetic software version
5.2.1 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). A 
non-compartmental approach consistent with the subcutaneous
injection route of administration was used for estimation of
Cmax and area-under-the-curve (AUC).
Gross Pathology
Surviving main-study animals were euthanized on day 92
and surviving recovery animals were euthanized on day 120.
Animals were exsanguinated from the abdominal aorta after
isoflurane anaesthesia. Blood samples were obtained, and
pancreata were collected, examined, weighed and fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin for histologic analysis. Necropsy
examinations were conducted under the supervision of a 
board-certified veterinary pathologist. Pancreas:body weight ratio
(using the terminal fasted body weight obtained at necropsy)
was calculated.
Histological Evaluation of Pancreas
The pancreata were embedded in paraffin within 48 h following
necropsy. Five-micron-thick sections from the body of the
pancreas were cut at four different levels with approximately
100 μm between each level. Two sections (one each from 1st and
3rd level) from each animal were stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). The histopathologic evaluation was performed
by a board-certified veterinary pathologist and peer-reviewed.
Sections adjacent to H&E-stained sections obtained from each
level were processed to detect ductal cell proliferation and
apoptosis with a Ki-67 mouse monoclonal antibody (diluted at
1:15, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and a TUNEL staining kit
(Apoptag peroxidase kit, Millipore S-7100, Billerica, MA, USA),
respectively. Each section was dually stained with a 
cytokeratin-20 (CK-20) mouse monoclonal antibody (diluted at 1:25, Dako)
to identify pancreatic ductal cells. Diaminobenzidine (Dako)
and Vector VIP substrate (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA)
were used as chromogens.
Quantification of proliferation and apoptosis were 
conducted by counting a targeted total of 1000 to 2000 
CK-20-positive ductal cells (centroacinar cells and epithelial cells
lining the intercalated, intralobular and interlobular ducts) per
animal, using at least two slides for each marker. Only those
ductal cells with clear nuclei were counted with Image-Pro Plus
software (version 6.3; Bethesda, MD, USA). For each animal,
the proportion of Ki-67-positive cells was calculated by 
dividing the Ki-67 cell count by the total ductal cell count. Similar
calculations were conducted with TUNEL positive ductal cells.
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as mean ± SD and/or incidence. For each
endpoint, the treatment groups were compared to the controls.
Levene’s test was used to assess homogeneity of group variances.
When Levene’s test was not significant (p ≥ 0.01), a pooled
original article
estimate of the variance [mean square error (MSE)] was
computed from a one-way analysis of variance (anova) and
utilized by a Dunnett’s comparison of each treatment group
with the control group. When Levene’s test was significant
(p < 0.01), comparisons with the control group were made
using Welch’s t-test with a Bonferroni correction. Results of all
pair-wise comparisons were reported at 0.05 significance levels.
Comparison of survival curves was performed using the 
log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Statistical tests comparing percentage
proliferation and apoptosis in each treatment group to the
control group were performed using two-sided contrasts.
Results
Dosing Formulation Analysis
Exenatide was not detected in samples collected from
group 1 (vehicle) formulations. All samples collected from
dose formulations were within ±10% of their nominal
concentrations with occasional small deviations up to ±15%,
which did not affect the scientific validity of the study.
Clinical Observations
Clinical signs noted in controls that were judged to be
attributed to the progression of type 2 diabetes disease state
(typically observed in this animal model) included decreased
activity, generalized weakness, thinness/prominent backbone,
eyes partly closed, cold to the touch, dehydration, abnormal
breathing or abnormal breathing sounds. Additional clinical
signs were also noted along the tail (severed tail, discolouration
of the skin with or without lesions/scabs/discharge) and on
the prepuce (swelling, skin red/white sometimes accompanied
with lesions with or without mucoid/white/green discharge).
Owing to the extent and severity of some of the above clinical
signs, five control animals required veterinary treatment or
progressed such that the animals required humane euthanasia.
Animals administered exenatide exhibited fewer clinical signs of
disease progression than did control animals. Exenatide-treated
animals were observed to have dorsal skin scabs or dry skin,
with increased incidence in 250 μg/kg/day-treated rats (group
4) compared to controls; this effect was considered 
exenatide-related, but not adverse. There were no other exenatide-related
clinical observations at any dose level.
Body Weight and Food Intake
Group mean body weight and weight gain in control animals
were consistent with the anticipated disease model. At
approximately week 4 of the treatment period, mean body
weight for control animals stabilized while that of 
exenatide-treated rats showed a continuous, dose-related increase that
persisted during the recovery period (figure 1A). Overall weight
gain from predose baseline during the 12-week treatment
period was 84.8, 90.7 and 92.7% in animals treated with
exenatide at 6, 40 and 250 μg/kg/day, respectively, compared
with 64.3% in the control group. During the recovery period,
mean weight gain was more evident in treated animals, as
control animals maintained lower weight gain or exhibited
weight loss.

Mean food intake of animals administered exenatide was
lower than that of control animals overall, which was
inversely correlated with increases seen in body weight in
exenatide-treated rats (figure 1B); this effect was an expected
pharmacological effect of exenatide. Differences in food intake
between control and treatment animals were more noticeable
from weeks 1 to 10 of treatment and returned to control levels
thereafter and during the recovery period. In control animals,
increases in food consumption did not correlate to increases in
mean body weight, which was reflective of the disease state.
Glycaemic Control
Mean HbA1c values in controls increased on day 30 and
remained elevated throughout the treatment and recovery
periods (figure 2A). Mean HbA1c levels in exenatide-treated
groups throughout the treatment and recovery periods were
lower than those observed for control animals and were higher
than baseline levels. The change from baseline was the smallest
at 40 and 250 μg/kg/day exenatide doses and was lower than
that seen in controls. Changes in HbA1c values throughout the
study concurred with trends observed in changes in glucose
concentrations. Mean glucose concentrations in controls
increased more than threefold on day 30 compared to baseline
and remained elevated throughout the treatment and recovery
periods (figure 2B). Mean glucose concentrations for 
exenatide-treated rats were lower than those observed in control animals
and increased by 1.6- to 2-fold above that of pre-treatment
levels. Differences between control and exenatide-treated
animals were most notable at 40 and 250 μg/kg/day exenatide
dose levels and were still apparent at the end of the recovery
period.
In control animals, mean insulin values remained 
comparable to baseline values throughout the treatment and recovery
periods (figure 2C). In exenatide-treated animals, mean insulin
concentrations increased significantly by 2.8- to 4.2-fold on
day 30 and remained elevated throughout the treatment and

recovery periods compared to baseline and control animals.
Observed changes in HbA1c, glucose and insulin in treatment
groups were expected pharmacological effects of exenatide.
Animal Survival
Exenatide-treated animals showed significantly improved
survival, which was attributed to an overall improvement
in general physical condition and health (figure 2D). Five
control animals were euthanized during the treatment period
and one control animal was euthanized during the recovery
period due to generalized deterioration of the animals’ health
status. The cause of the poor health status of these control
animals was established to be secondary complications due to
their diabetic state. Two control animals were also found dead
during the study period and the exact cause of death could not
be established. One exenatide-treated (250 μg/kg/day) animal
was found dead at end of the recovery period shortly after blood
collection. The exact cause of death could not be determined
from macroscopic and microscopic examinations but potential
contributing factors included weight loss, decreased food
consumption and blood collection procedure via venipuncture.
As this death occurred during the off-drug period and in the
absence of any prior clinical signs, a relationship to exenatide
was considered unlikely.
range of values seen in controls at the end of the recovery period
and were well below the changes that are typically observed
during experimentally induced pancreatitis. There was a slight
increase in mean lipase concentrations on day 30 in all groups
(including controls) compared to baseline values. The increase
remained stable at all time points in the exenatide-treated
groups but increased slightly in controls. On days 60 and 90
and at the end of recovery, mean lipase concentrations were
lower in exenatide-treated groups than in the control group;
these changes were dose-dependent (figure 3B).
There were no exenatide-related effects on absolute pancreas
weight or pancreas weight relative to body weight (figure 1C).
No exenatide-related macroscopic changes in pancreata from
main and recovery necropsies were found. A dose-related
increase in the incidence and degree (minimal to moderate) of
islet hypertrophy was observed during the recovery period with
exenatide doses of ≥6 μg/kg/day (Table 2). No adverse effects
of exenatide on the exocrine pancreas (acinar and ductal cells)
were observed across all exenatide-treated groups. Incidental
microscopic findings, including acinar cell focal hyperplasia or
necrosis, duct intraluminal concretion and subacute or acute
inflammation were observed in the pancreas across all groups
including controls and were not considered toxicologically
significant based on incidence, severity, distribution and
historical control data (Table 2).
Pancreatic Function and Structure
Mean total amylase concentrations in controls remained
comparable to baseline on days 30 and 60 and increased
to 3395 ± 1016 U/l on day 90. Mild and time-dependent
increases in mean total amylase concentrations, reaching
statistical significance in comparison to controls, were
seen in all exenatide-treated groups during the treatment
phase (figure 3A). In exenatide-treated rats, mean amylase
concentration reached a plateau during the treatment period
(observed on the last sampling day, day 90) and remained
stable until the end of the recovery period. Of note, these
minor changes in amylase concentrations were within the same
Pharmacokinetics (PK)
Peak plasma exenatide concentrations were reached within
30 min post-dose for all groups, followed by a 
mono-exponential decline which captured the terminal elimination
phase for all profiles. The half-life of the first daily dose
was estimated to be between 0.4 and 0.9 h. Exposure [Cmax
(figure 4A) and AUC[0-∞] (figure 4B)] increased substantially
after 3 months of exenatide administration with accumulation
ratios between 2.7 and 4.4, despite pre-dose concentrations
below the lower limit of quantification (23 pg/ml) on day 90.
Exposure increased with ascending exenatide dose level and
was proportional between 20 and 125 μg/kg/dose (dose levels

of 40 and 250 μg/kg/day, respectively) on days 1 and 91 but
was greater than proportional to dose level between 3 and
20 μg/kg/dose (6 and 40 μg/kg/day, respectively).
Histomorphometry
CK-20-positive ductal cells were found scattered across the
entire tissue and located in main and terminal pancreatic
ducts (figure 5). However, proliferative signals (based on 
Ki67-positive staining) were rarely seen in these cells (figure 5).
The percentage of proliferating pancreatic ductal cells was
very low (<0.1%) in all groups. There were no 
exenatide-related effect on ductal cell proliferation rate (0.035 ± 0.050 %,
0.070 ± 0.093 %, 0.063 ± 0.122% for the 6-, 40-, 240-μg/kg/day
exenatide doses, respectively) when compared to vehicle control
(0.025 ± 0.040%) at the end of the treatment period. The duct
proliferation rates at the end of the recovery period remained
similarly low and no exenatide-related effects were observed
(data not shown).
Apoptotic cells (based on TUNEL positive staining) were
observed in all groups, although infrequently, and were
scattered throughout the pancreatic tissue. Apoptotic signals
were not seen in the ductal CK-20-positive stained cells in
DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM
pancreata of exenatide-treated animals and they were very
rarely seen in ductal cells of control animals. There were no
differences in the percent apoptosis parameter for ductal cells of
the pancreas of exenatide-treated animals compared to control
animals.
Discussion
The subcutaneous twice-daily administration of exenatide at
doses of 6, 40 and 250 μg/kg/day for 3 months in type 2
diabetic obese ZDF rats was associated with expected and
beneficial improvements to the disease state with effects on
body weight, food consumption, HbA1c, glucose, insulin,
minimal-to-moderate hypertrophy of pancreatic islets and
survival. Exenatide was considered to be without adverse
effect on pancreatic exocrine structure and function, and
no exenatide-related effects were observed on pancreatic
ductal cell proliferation or apoptosis. Slight increases (within
normal ranges) in total amylase concentrations were observed
in exenatide-treated animals during the study but were
not considered toxicologically significant based on the
magnitude of the changes and the absence of any correlating
histopathological evidence. Thus, in this study, the no -

observed - adverse-effect-level for potential effects on
pancreatic exocrine structure and function was determined
to be ≥250 μg/kg/day.
The effects of exenatide on glucose metabolism and
islet morphology in this study are consistent with other
studies performed in diabetic rodents treated with 
GLP-1RAs [15,22-27]. Similar to a previous study in ZDF rats,
exenatide-treated animals did not lose weight despite decreased
food intake [22]. Such dissociation between food intake and
weight gain can indicate normalization of metabolic processes
with potential augmentation of insulin action and/or with
the reversal of glycosuria, as observed in ZDF rats treated
with PYY[3-36] [28]. Regardless of the mechanism, the
disparity between weight gain versus glucose-lowering and

insulin stimulation effects indicates that the latter are not being
driven by changes in body weight.
Exenatide-treated animals experienced improved survival,
reflecting improved condition and disease control. All animals
dosed with exenatide survived during the dosing period, with
only one animal from the highest-dose group (exenatide
250 μg/kg/day) euthanized during the recovery phase, likely
due to an exacerbation of the compromised health status of this
animal by study procedures. In contrast, 40% of animals in the
control group were euthanized due to deteriorating conditions
of diabetes or were found dead during the treatment phase.
Clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in humans is based
on severe abdominal pain and radiographically confirmed
pancreatic oedema accompanied by increases in amylase
and/or lipase at least threefold above the upper limit of
normal; lipase concentrations are considered more specific
for the diagnosis of pancreatitis than amylase [29]. Acinar
cells, which secrete digestive enzymes into pancreatic ducts,
are considered to play one of the most important roles in the
development of pancreatitis; however, mechanisms responsible
for developing and modifying the severity of pancreatitis are
not well characterized [30]. Multiple drugs have been suggested
to stimulate or worsen pancreatitis [31].
In this study, absolute or relative (normalized to body
weight) pancreatic weights were not affected by treatment
with exenatide at all doses tested. No behaviour indicative of
abdominal pain or discomfort was reported from daily clinical
observations. Histological assessments did not reveal any 
drug-related structural changes in the exocrine pancreas. Compared
to the vehicle control, exenatide treatment did not result in
increased lipase concentrations and, moreover, the highest dose
of exenatide significantly decreased this enzyme, consistent with
previous findings [12]. Total amylase concentrations increased
in exenatide-treated animals, although this increase was
relatively minor and not clinically significant (approximately
30% above values in vehicle-treated rats). Furthermore,
amylase concentrations were higher during the study than
during the off-drug period in both exenatide-treated and
control animals. Amylase continued to increase in control
animals over the duration of the study and reached comparable
values to exenatide-treated animals at the end of the recovery
period.
Changes in pancreatic amylase secretion might be mediated
via GLP-1 receptors expressed on acinar cells or via indirect
mechanisms. However, in contrast to the unambiguous
evidence of the presence of GLP-1 receptors in pancreatic
β-cells, the existing literature regarding receptors in acinar
cells is very limited and controversial. To our knowledge,
there has been no convincing evidence that GLP-1 receptors
are expressed in human or rodent acinar cells using validated
immunohistochemical approaches complemented with other
techniques such as in situ ligand binding or in situhybridization.
Also, it is not clear whether receptor expression and density
is species dependent. GLP-1 receptor expression was seen in
ductal cells but was not visible in acinar cells of mouse or rat
pancreata [17,24]. GLP-1 receptor presence was revealed in
acinar cells in some human samples by autoradiography [32]
and confirmed by PCR in an acinar cell line; however, GLP-1
DIABETES, OBESITY AND METABOLISM
did not mediate amylase secretion in these cells [19]. Moreover,
emerging literature on the development of radiolabelled
exenatide analogues for radiotherapy of insulinoma or imaging
of β-cell mass in humans would suggest lack of noteworthy
GLP-1 receptor expression in any pancreatic cells except β-
cells [33,34]. Such an argument is supported by our recent
(unpublished) observations in rodents using ligand binding
and in situ hybridization, in which GLP-1 receptor signals
were not detected in either acinar or pancreatic ductal cells.
Therefore, direct stimulation of acinar cells to secrete digestive
enzymes via GLP-1 receptor agonism seems unlikely.
A similar modest increase in pancreatic amylase was reported
in a recent study of ZDF rats treated with exenatide and
liraglutide [15]. Stimulation of amylase secretion might result
from paracrine communication between acinar and β-cells;
thus, as GLP-1RAs have potent insulinotropic activity, locally
increased insulin levels can stimulate insulin receptors in acinar
cells leading to enhanced amylase secretion via a well recognized
islet-acinar axis [35]. The present histological findings do
not support the recently postulated hypothesis that increased
pancreatic enzyme secretion can be caused by abnormally
proliferating and obstructed pancreatic ducts [36]. The
thorough histological examination did not reveal 
treatment-related pathological changes in the exocrine pancreas of ZDF
rats in the current study, similar to previously published
data in other rodent models [12]. Furthermore, as confirmed
by detailed morphometic analysis, exenatide did not affect
apoptosis of ductal cells and their proliferation rate was
relatively low and comparable to the proliferation rate in
normal human pancreatic ducts [37]. Similar to this study, there
were no adverse effects on pancreas structure seen in 
exenatide-and liraglutide-treated ZDF rats [14,15]. Additionally, no
modification of susceptibility to or severity of experimental
pancreatitis was observed in mice treated with exenatide [13].
Other studies do not concur with the present results.
Nachnani et al. [16] observed that exenatide did not change
amylase but moderately increased lipase in normal rats after
chronic treatment (75 days) and caused a subtle increase in
acinar inflammation and pyknotic nuclei in the pancreas. Gier
et al. [17] reported that chronic activation of GLP-1 receptor
by exenatide induced expansion of pancreatic duct glands in
normal rats without evidence of pancreatitis. There is some
evidence that GLP-1RAs can enhance differentiation of ductal
cells to β-cells [19,24,38]; therefore, local increases in ductal
cell proliferation may also be interpreted as beneficial effects in
pancreatic tissue.
Recent commentary by Butler et al. [36] raised a concern
that chronic exposure to GLP-1RAs may result in chronic
asymptomatic pancreatitis. However, studies performed in
multiple disease models showed that exenatide did not evoke
pancreatitis and in some instances attenuated the condition
[12]. The current study, which used ZDF rats - commonly
considered to be the gold-standard rodent model of human
type 2 diabetes - also does not support the hypothesis that
chronic GLP-1RA treatment may lead to pancreatitis.
Recently, Vrang et al. [15] published findings in ZDF rats
treated with liraglutide and exenatide in which study design,
rigorousness of performance of the study under good laboratory

practice conditions, results and conclusions were very similar
to those contained herein, further supporting our current
findings.
The limitations of this study included lack of exploration of
the mechanisms involved in any observed pancreatic exocrine
changes. However, beyond the expected metabolic and survival
improvements, there were no changes apart from a small
increase in plasma amylase, and thus, little reason to study
potential mechanisms. Further, we cannot conclude that the
source of increased amylase was derived from the pancreas
as there was a potential contribution of salivary amylase.
Additionally, proliferation rate was generally evaluated in
ductal cells identified by positive staining with CK-20 without
additional analysis of ductal cell subpopulations in specific
ductal structures or in different regions of the pancreas.
In conclusion, long-term exposure to exenatide at plasma
concentrations several-fold higher than therapeutic levels in
humans resulted in the expected metabolic benefits in the
ZDF rat model of type 2 diabetes. Importantly, a significant
increase in animal survival was observed with exenatide
treatment. Exenatide did not adversely affect exocrine pancreas
morphology or function in this model. These data continue to
build upon the extensive evidence in animal models showing
that exenatide treatment does not cause histopathological
changes in the exocrine pancreas that could be associated
with pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancies. As nonclinical
data may not be fully predictive of human safety, and in
the context of a generally very low incidence of pancreatitis,
further research is warranted to evaluate whether GLP-1RA-
based therapies could be associated with the potential risk for
this condition.
