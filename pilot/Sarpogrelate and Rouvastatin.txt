Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major complication of metabolic disorders such as 
diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Comorbidity of these diseases is the factor 
exacerbating CKD progression. Statins are commonly used in patients with metabolic disorders to
decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. Sarpogrelate, a selective antagonist of
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptor, inhibits platelet aggregation and is used to
improve peripheral circulation in diabetic patients. Here, we investigated the effects of 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin on CKD in mice that were subjected to a high fat diet (HFD) for
22 weeks and a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg). When mice were 
administrated sarpogrelate (50 mg/kg, p.o.) for 13 weeks, albuminuria and urinary cystatin C
excretion were normalized and histopathological changes such as glomerular mesangial
expansion, tubular damage, and accumulations in lipid droplets and collagen were 
significantly improved. Sarpogrelate treatment repressed the HFD/STZ-induced CD31 and 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expressions, indicating the attenuation of
glomerular endothelial proliferation. Additionally, sarpogrelate inhibited interstitial fibrosis
by suppressing the increases in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). All of these functional and histological improvements were also
seen in rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg) group and, notably, the combinatorial treatment with 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin showed additive beneficial effects on histopathological changes by
HFD/STZ. Moreover, sarpogrelate reduced circulating levels of PAI-1 that were elevated in
the HFD/STZ group. As supportive in vitro evidence, sarpogrelate incubation blocked 
TGF-β1/5-HT-inducible PAI-1 expression in murine glomerular mesangial cells. Taken together,
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin may be advantageous to control the progression of CKD in
patients with comorbid metabolic disorders, and particularly, the use of sarpogrelate as
adjunctive therapy with statins may provide additional benefits on CKD.

Renal Benefits of Sarpogrelate and Rosuvastatin
Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by the gradual reduction in glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) and elevation in urinary albumin excretion [1, 2]. CKD is a progressive disease that 
proceeds to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in which patients are in need of renal dialysis or kidney
transplantation [3]. It has been estimated that more than 10% of adults have CKD and the
prevalence is much greater in high-risk populations such as elderly people [1, 4]. The 
significance of CKD can be found in its strong correlation with the cardiovascular diseases: CKD
patients exhibited higher rates of incidence in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke
[5, 6].
As causative diseases of CKD, metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, 
hyper-lipidemia, and hypertension showed strong associations with CKD [1, 7]. Diabetic CKD is the
leading cause of ESRD, and CKD prevalence in diabetic patients was known to be up to 40%
[8]. In a large cohort study of health men, increased body mass index showed a significantly
higher CKD risk after a 14-year follow up [9]. The decline of renal function in middle-aged
men with dyslipidemia was accelerated by the increased levels of the low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ration [10]. It is noteworthy that metabolic disorders
are usually comorbid diseases. In the cohort study of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES), 61% of patients with type 2 diabetes were obese and 46% of diabetic
patients had lipid abnormalities [11]. Comorbid illness affected CKD prevalence: patients with
comorbidities of metabolic disorders have a greater risk for CKD aggravation than patients
with s single disease do [12]. In a cohort of patients with CKD stage 3, multimorbidity of 
metabolic disorders showed the association with the GFR decrease [13]. As an animal model of 
metabolic disorders, high-fat diet (HFD) has been used widely [14]. Particularly, it was shown that
HFD (16 weeks) in C57BL/6JJ mice developed a prediabetic nephropathy that accompanied
albuminuria, glomerular enlargement, and marginal levels of collagen deposition [15]. In 
addition, HFD-induced nephropathy has been exacerbated by the addition of low dose of 
streptozo-tocin (STZ), indicating that the coexistence of metabolic diseases can accelerate CKD [16, 17].
Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is one of major features and a reliable predictor of progressive 
diabetic CKD [18]. In fibrotic CKD lesions, excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin is observed [19, 20]. It has been demonstrated that
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an important mediator that produces ECM in 
various renal cell types such as fibroblasts, tubular epithelial cells, and mesangial cells [21, 22].
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a well-known downstream target of TGF-β1 
signaling [23, 24]. PAI-1 prevents the degradation of ECM proteins by inhibiting the conversion
of tissue plasminogen to plasmin, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-like protease [23]. In
addition, the level of plasma PAI-1 correlated with the pathologies of diabetes, obesity, and 
cardiovascular disease [25-28].
Platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is released to the systemic circulation
where it mediates multiple deleterious functions, including vascular smooth muscle 
constriction and proliferation, and platelet aggregation through the 5-HT2A receptor [29, 30]. In 
diabetic patients, platelets are activated and therefore the plasma 5-HT level is high and platelet
aggregation in enhanced [31, 32]. Sarpogrelate, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, is an
anti-platelet drug and is currently used in patients with peripheral arterial disease and diabetes
[33]. Based on the association of 5-HT with diabetic vasculature, a beneficial effect of 
sarpogrelate on metabolic disorder-induced CKD can be hypothesized. The statin therapy is commonly
used for the patients with metabolic disorders to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events [34].
Based on the clinical observations showing the linkage between dyslipidemia and CKD, the
potential benefits of statin therapy has gained great attentions [35, 36]. Based on these, in order

to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin on CKD, we
used the HFD-fed C57BL/6JJ mice that were administered with a single and low dose of STZ as
a model of metabolic disorder-induced CKD. In addition, because many patients with 
metabolic disorders are under the statin treatment to treat comorbid dyslipidemia and to prevent
cardiovascular events, we also asked the potential renobeneficial effects of combination of 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin in these mice.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Sarpogrelate hydrochloride was obtained from Chemtros (Ansan, Republic of Korea), and
rosuvastatin calcium was from Yuhan Chemical Inc. (Ansan, Republic of Korea). Antibodies
for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), PAI-1, TGF-β1, and collagen IV
were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, UK). Antibodies that recognize glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), β-tubulin, and secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit
and goat anti-mouse) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA).
Caspase-3 and CD31 antibodies were from BD Sciences (San Jose, CA, USA) and Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA), respectively. Most reagents such as STZ and 5-HT were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (Saint Louis, MO, USA).
Renal Benefits of Sarpogrelate and Rosuvastatin
Animal experiment
C56BL/6J male mice at 7-weeks of age were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. (Gyeonggi-do,
Republic of Korea). After a week of quarantine, mice were maintained in a specific pathogen
free environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animal experimental protocol was approved
by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Animal Care and Experimentation at the Catholic
University of Korea (Approval number: 2014-021). A total of 34 mice was randomly divided
into five groups: the normal fat diet (NFD) group (n = 4), the HFD/STZ control group (n = 5),
the HFD/STZ + sarpogrelate group (n = 8), the HFD/STZ + rosuvastatin (n = 7), and the HFD/
STZ + sarpogrelate + rosuvastatin group (n = 7). The NFD and HFD groups were continuously
fed either a normal chow diet (fat 18%, protein 24%, and carbohydrates 58%; Harlan 
Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or a HFD with a composition of 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20%
carbohydrate (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 22 weeks. After 7 weeks of a
HFD, the HFD/STZ groups received STZ (40 mg/kg) dissolved in sodium citrate (pH 4.5) via
intraperitoneal injection. The NFD group was injected with the sodium citrate vehicle. At
Week 9 of the HFD, mice were administered either vehicle (0.9% saline), sarpogrelate (50 mg/
kg dissolved in saline), and/or rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg dissolved in saline) via oral gavage for 13
weeks. Sarpogrelate was administered 6 days a week and rosuvastatin was treated 5 days a
week. After the completion of the HFD for 22 weeks, mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether
and serum samples were performed by cardiac puncture. Kidneys were harvested following a
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) perfusion and then formalin-fixed or frozen for subsequent
analyses.

Measurements of serum glucose and lipids
At 5 days after STZ injection and during week 15 of the HFD, mice were fasted overnight (12
h) and blood samples were collected by cutting the tip of the tail. Fasting serum glucose levels
were measured using an Accu-Chek blood glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, 
Aus-tralia). The levels of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were
determined in serum with an Idexx VetTest Biochemical Analyzer (Westbrook, ME, USA).
3 / 18
The serum PAI-1 levels, which include active, inactive, and latent forms of PAI-1, were
assessed using a PAI-1 Total Mouse ELISA kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Measurements of urine albumin and cystatin C
Mice were placed in metabolic cages at week 20 of the HFD and were adapted for 24 h. Two to
three mice were housed per metabolic cage and pooled urine samples were collected for 15 h.
For each group, three different collections were performed. The urinary albumin level was
determined with an Albuwell M ELISA kit (Exocell Inc., PA, USA) according to the 
manufac-turer’s instructions. The urinary cystatin C level was quantified using the Mouse/Rat Cystatin
C Quantikine kit (R&D Systems, MN, USA). The measured albumin and cystatin C levels were
normalized corresponding urine creatinine levels, which were determined using the Idexx 
Vet-Test Biochemical Analyzer.

Determination of renal histopathology
Kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned
(3~4 μm), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for general observations of 
histopa-thology with a light microscope (Nikkon, Tokyo, Japan) [37, 38]. Histological evaluation was
performed in the central zone of the cortex. The numbers of glomeruli with mesangial 
expansion and vasodilation, and the numbers of vacuolated renal tubules were counted using a 
com-puter-based automated image analyzer (iSolution FL ver 9.1, IMT i-solution Inc., Vancouver,
Quebec, Canada) according to previously established methods [37]. These histomorphological
measurements were represented as the percentage number of glomeruli or tubules. Two 
histological fields for each kidney tissue were analyzed. The histopathologist was blind to treatment
groups when analysis was made.
Oil red O and collagen staining
Portions of kidney were dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution and then sectioned with a 
cryostat for Oil red O staining. For the staining of collagen fibers, paraffin-embedded tissue slices
were stained with Sirius red. Collagen occupied regions indicated by Sirius red staining (% of
stained area) were quantified as established previously [37]. Areas of renal tubules with lipid
droplet deposition were analyzed in Oil red O stained. Two histological fields were analyzed in
each kidney tissue.
Immunohistochemical analysis
The immunoreactivities against the apoptotic marker caspase-3, endothelial marker CD31 and
Vegfr, and pro-fibrotic markers TGF-β1 and PAI-1 were quantified in the kidney cortex using
the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) and peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Labs, 
Burlin-game, CA, USA). Briefly, tissue slices were heated (95-100°C) in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for epitopes retrieval. Endogenous tissue peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating in
methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. The normal horse serum blocking solution was
incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber to block non-specific binding of immunoglobulin.
Endogenous avidin and biotin were blocked by avidin/biotin blocking reagent (Dako, 
Carpin-teria, CA, USA). The primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C in a 
humidified chamber, followed by incubation at room temperature with the appropriate biotinylated
secondary antibody for 1 h and the ABC reagent. Finally, tissue sections were incubated with

peroxidase substrate for 3 min and immunoreactive areas were quantified with an automated
image analyzer [39].
Western blot analysis
The other halves of frozen kidney sections were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) with a
tissue homogenizer (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany). The protein 
homoge-nates were centrifuged twice at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatants were obtained and
the protein concentrations were assessed with Bicinchoninic Acid Kits (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Inc. Waltham, MCA, USA). Proteins were separated on 10-12% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Biosciences,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Membranes were blocked by incubation in 1% skim milk or 3% bovine
serum albumin for 1 h. Incubation with the appropriate primary antibody performed 
overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. 
Chemilumines-cent images were captured with an ImageQuant LAS 4000 Mini (GE Healthcare Biosciences).
Cell Culture
The mouse glomerular mesangial cell line SV40 MES 13 (MES13) was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MES13 was maintained in a medium
containing a 3:1 mixture (v/v) of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and Ham’s F-12 medium
(GE HealthCare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) with 5% fetal bovine serum (GE HealthCare
Life Sciences) supplementation. The cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere.
MTT assay
Cells were grown in 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well. After drug treatment,
the cells were incubated with an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide
(MTT) solution (2 mg/mL) for 4 h. The reduced formazan was solubilized in dimethyl 
sulfox-ide (DMSO) and optical absorbance was determined with a SPECTROstar Nano microplate
reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 540 nm.
RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the cells with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).
cDNA synthesis was performed by an RT reaction as described previously [40]. For relative
quantification of the mRNA levels, PCR analyses were performed with a Roche LightCycler
(Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH). The PCR primer sequences used for murine pai-1
were 5’-ACGTTGTGGAACTGCCCTAC-3’ AMF 5’-GCCAGGGTTGCACTAAACAT-3’
(Bioneer Corporation, Daejeon, Republic of Korea).
Statistical Analysis
Multiple comparison tests for different treatment groups were conducted. Variance homogeneity
was examined using the Levene test. If the Levene test indicated no significant deviations from
variance homogeneity, the data were analyzed by a one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) 
followed by the least-significant differences (LSD) multi-comparison test to determine which pairs
of groups were significantly different (analysis of vacuolated renal tubules, 
immunohistochem-cial analysis of PAI-1). In the case of significant deviations from variance homogeneity in

Levene’s test, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was conducted and then, followed by the Mann-Whitney
U (MW) test. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (Release 14.0K, SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered significant at P< 0.05.
Results
Establishment of HFD/STZ-induced CKDmouse model
In order to establish a CKD model, C57BL/6JJ mice were subjected to a NFD or a 60%-fat diet
at 8 weeks of age. During week 8 of the HFD, the mean body weights of mice were 29 g and
44 g in NFD and HFD groups, respectively. At Week 8 of HFD, a single and low dose of STZ
(40 mg/kg, p.o.) was injected into HFD group mice to accelerate CKD progression. It was
shown that a single administration of low dose STZ (100 mg/kg) developed non-insulin 
dependent diabetes in mice [41]. At 5 days after STZ treatment, the level of fasting blood glucose was
elevated from 166 mg/dl (NFD) to 220 mg/dl (HFD/STZ), whereas the level of the HFD only
group was 208 mg/dl (data not shown). One week after STZ injection, treatment with 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin were started and proceeded to week 22, along with the HFD. The body
weights of STZ-treated mice decreased slightly week 10. However, all groups showed steady
increases in body weight after week 11, and there were no noticeable differences between 
treatment groups (Fig 1A). During the treatment period, the fasting blood glucose level was 
determined at week 15. The results show that the HFD-STZ group displayed a higher level of blood
glucose than the NFD mice (Fig 1B). The HFD only group showed a lower fasting glucose level
than HFD/STZ group although no statistical significance was observed (unpublished data),
which implied that STZ treatment contributed to CKD acceleration. Drug treatment did not
show statistically significant changes in HFD/STZ-induced glucose increase.

Sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin attenuate renal dysfunction in HFD/STZ
mice
At week 21, mouse urine was collected for 15 h and the levels of urine albumin, cystatin C, total
protein, and creatinine were determined in order to monitor renal function. The urine
6 / 18
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153965.g002
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was elevated by 2.37-fold in the HFD/STZ group 
compared to the NFD group, which implies that CKD developed in these mice (Fig 2A). All 
treatment groups showed complete prevention of UACR increase, indicating that sarpogrelate,
rosuvastatin, and their combination are all effective for CKD protection. Similarly, when
another renal dysfunction marker, cystatin C was measured, the magnitude of the urine 
cystatin C-to-creatinine ratio significantly increased in the HFD/STD group, and drug treatment
groups showed significant decreases (Fig 2B). Whereas, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio
was not elevated in the HFD/STZ group compared to the NFD group (data not shown). These
results indicate that the combination of the HFD and a single low dose of STZ resulted in an
UACR increase, which is a prototypical marker of diabetic CKD. In this animal model, 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin significantly ameliorated renal dysfunction and improved UACR and
urinary cystatin C excretion.
All animals were terminated at Week 22. In final samples, the mean blood cholesterol level
was significantly elevated the HFD/STZ mice when compared to the NFD mice. However, total
triglyceride and BUN levels did not show significant increases (Table 1). The final body
weights, kidney weights, and blood cholesterol were not altered by drug treatments. The 
sarpogrelate treatment group showed a triglyceride increase compared with the HFD/STZ group,
raising a concern about the negative effect of sarpogrelate on blood lipid levels. However, we
observed that the HFD-induced fatty liver development was substantially diminished by 
sarpogrelate treatment (unpublished data). In addition, our additional recent data indicated that 
sarpogrelate administration in HFD mice (for 12 weeks) did not affect blood triglyceride levels
(unpublished data). Although further examination is required, these results indicate that the
unwanted effects of sarpogrelate on blood lipid regulation might be minimal.
Sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin ameliorate renal structural changes
CKD is accompanied by several renal structural changes, including glomerular and mesangial
expansion, glomerular endothelial proliferation, ECM accumulation, and tubular damage [42].
Histopathological examination of renal tissues showed glomerular structural changes: glomerular

vasodilation and mesangial expansion were substantially elevated in the HFD/STZ group when
compared to the NFD (Fig 3A and 3B). The HFD/STZ mice showed statistically significant
increases in the numbers of vacuoles or lipid droplets deposition in renal tubules (Fig 3A, 3C and
3D). Consistent with these morphologic changes, the level of caspase 3-reactive regions, another
marker of tubular damage, was elevated in HFD/STZmice (Fig 3E). Notably, these 
histomorpho-metric and immunohistochemical changes were significantly attenuated by treatment with 
sarpogrelate or rosuvastatin. In particular, the combination of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin
displayed additive effects in all three of these parameters. These results indicate that the HFD/
STZ-induced nephropathy was effectively ameliorated by sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin.
Sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin suppress glomerular endothelial
proliferation
Abnormal angiogenesis plays a pathological role in CKD [43, 44]. In order to monitor renal
angiogenesis, the levels of CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, and VEGFR-2 were determined
using immunohistochemical analysis. The HFD/STZ group showed increases in CD31 and
VEGFR-2 protein levels, indicating that angiogenesis is aberrantly activated in the kidneys (Fig
4A-4C). On the other hand, the treatment of mice with sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin 
effectively attenuated CD31 and VEGFR-2 increases. Furthermore, the enhanced protective effects
of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin in combination were statistically significant.
HFD/STZ-induced renal fibrosis is diminished by sarpogrelate and
rosuvastatin
The deposition of ECM in the glomerulus and tubule, and progressive tublointerstitial fibrosis
are major determinants of CKD [20]. In the HFD/STZ animals, cortex collagen deposition
indicated by Sirus red staining was highly elevated compared to the NFD group (Fig 5A). In
contrast, sarpogrelate and/or rosuvastatin reduced collagen staining. The HFD/STZ-induced
increase in the collagen type IV and collagen type I levels were consistently reduced by 
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin (Fig 5B and 5C).
Accumulation of ECM is associated with enhanced levels of TGF-β1 and PAI-1 in the 
kidney [22]. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that HFD/STZ treatment elevates kidney 
levels of TGF-β1 and PAI-1 and that these increases were ameliorated by drug treatments (Fig 6A
and 6B). Similarly to histomorphological improvements, the combination treatment with

compared with the HFD/STZ + R group. Two histological fields for each kidney tissue were analyzed. All data represent means ± SD. Scale bar = 120 μm.

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0153965 April 20, 2016
sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin showed significantly enhanced suppressions in TGF-β1 and
PAI-1. Western blot analysis confirmed the suppressive effects of sarpogrelate rosuvastatin on
PAI-1 increase (Fig 6C). At the same time, it was notable that serum level of PAI-1 was elevated
2.54-fold in mice with HFD/STZ treatment when compared with the NFD mice. This increase
could be diminished by sarpogrelate treatment (Fig 6D), indicating that sarpogrelate modulates
the circulating level of PAI-1 in HFD/STZ mice.

Sarpogrelate inhibits PAI-1 expression in glomerular mesangial cells
Glomerular mesangial cells play a critical role in the maintenance of structure of the glomerular
microvascular beds [45]. When these cells are confronted with detrimental stimuli such as 
metabolic and hemodynamic injuries, mesangial cells are activated to undergo proliferation and
excessive ECM production [45]. Histomorphological analysis showed that sarpogrelate 
ameliorated mesangial expansion and glomerular enlargement, and reduced collagen depositions in
the HFD/STZ mouse kidney. In order to have in vitro evidence, the murine mesangial cell line
MES13 was incubated with sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin, and the levels of the pro-fibrotic 
factor PAI-1 were monitored. The incubation of MES13 with sarpogrelate (10 μM) and varied
concentrations of rosuvastatin (2.5-40 μM) did not alter cell numbers, indicating no cytotoxic
and proliferative effects (Fig 7A). The incubation of MES13 with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h
elevated PAI-1 level and this increase was further enhanced by the co-incubation with 5-HT
(10 μM). Whereas, the TGF-β1/5-HT-induced PAI-1 increase was prevented by sarpogrelate
pre-incubation (Fig 7B). Similarly, the level of PAI-1 that was elevated by co-incubation with
TGF-β1 and 5-HT was blocked by sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin (10 μM) pre-incubation (Fig
7C). There was a trend for the TGF-β1/5-HT-inducible PAI-1 mRNA level to be diminished by
sarpogrelate treatment; however, no statistical significance was obtained, implying the 
involvement of post-translational regulation mechanism (Fig 7D). Our results indicate that 
sarpogrelate reduced the PAI-1 protein level in mesangial cells and that this could be one of the
molecular mechanisms mediating the renoprotective effect of sarpogrelate.

Discussion
Although causative diseases are distinct, in all CKDs, a loss of normal nephrons results in 
compensatory glomerular hyperfiltration in the remaining nephrons. Elevated glomerular pressure
causes endothelial injury and glomerular sclerosis, which ultimately lead to nephron 
malfunction. Glomerular injury and hyperfiltration give rise to albuminuria and the increase in urinary
protein is associated with the initiation of inflammation and interstitial fibrosis [46]. Metabolic
disorders, including obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, are independent 
factors that are strongly associated with CKD incidence [1]. In addition, multimorbidity of these
diseases increases the risk of CKD [12, 13]. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects
of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin on CKD in mice that were treated with 22-week HFD and a
single and low dose of STZ as a model of metabolic disorder-induced CKD. In our animal
model, renal morphological changes that are comparable to CKD were shown. These changes
were mesangial expansion, glomerular endothelial proliferation, tubular damage, lipid 
accumulation, and collagen deposition. Consistent with these structural changes, urinary excretions of

albumin and cystatin C were significantly enhanced, implying a reduction in renal function.
Because cystatin C undergoes glomerular filtration, proximal tubular reabsorption, and 
eventually, complete catabolism in proximal tubular cells [47], and therefore, urinary cystatin C level
can reflect tubular injury [48, 49]. Overall, the increased levels of UACR and the urinary

cystatin C/creatinine ratio indicate dysfunctions in the glomerulus and proximal tubule, and
confirm the establishment of the metabolic disorder-induced CKDmodel. Using this model,
we demonstrated that the sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin treatments that were started after 8
weeks of HFD and STZ, effectively ameliorates CKD progression by improving renal 
morphological changes and preserving renal function. Notably, combination of sarpogrelate and 
rosuvastatin showed an additive renoprotective benefit in normalizing histological and
immunopathological changes of CKD when compared to each treatment alone.
Sarpogrelate has been efficacious in various animal models of thrombosis, peripheral 
vascular disease, coronary artery diseases, and atherosclerosis [50]. Additionally, the potential

Renal Benefits of Sarpogrelate and Rosuvastatin
beneficial effect of sarpogrelate on CKD has been suggested in several animal studies. 
Sarpogrelate administration for 8 weeks reduced albuminuria, glomerular platelet aggregation, and 
glomerular NO depletion in STZ-treated rats [51]. In mouse model of fibrosis in which mice were
fed a 0.2% adenine diet for 6 weeks, sarpogrelate treatment (for 4 weeks) diminished 
tubuloin-terstitial fibrosis [52]. This study also demonstrated that renal fibrin deposition and PAI-1
increase were modulated by sarpogrelate treatment. Consistent with the animal evidence, 
sarpogrelate treatment improved albuminuria in patients with Type 2 diabetes especially, in the
early-stage CKD [53]. Similarly, albuminuria was diminished by sarpogrelate in patients with
diabetic CKD and atherosclerosis who were treated with an angiotensin II antagonist [54]. The
renoprotective effects of sarpogrelate can be attributed to the blockade of the deleterious effects
of the 5-HT2A receptor, including vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, and platelet 
aggregation [29]. In particular, the involvement of 5-HT in nephropathy has been suggested in several
reports. Blood 5-HT levels were high in diabetic patients, indicating that 5-HT-mediated 
platelet aggregation was increased in these patients [31, 32]. Additionally, the sensitivity to 5-HT-
induced vasoconstriction is significantly elevated in diabetic patients, implying the role of
5-HT in glomerular endothelial injury [55]. Moreover, 5-HT was shown to increase collagen
IV production in human mesangial cells through protein kinase C and TGF-β1 activation [56].
Advantageous effects of statins on the progression of CKD have been observed in clinical
observations. The Prospective Evaluation of Proteinuria and Renal Function in Diabetic
Patients with Progressive Renal Disease (PLANET) studies showed that atorvastatin for 52
days lowered proteinuria in patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes [57]. A collective
analysis of statin studies that had endpoints of CKD and cardiovascular diseases led to a 
conclusion that statin treatments improved microalbuminuria, proteinuria, and GFR in early
stages of CKD patients [58]. Based on the association of high lipid levels with CKD prevalence,
these beneficial effects on CKD can be attributed to the management of dyslipidemia [35].
However, several animal experiments demonstrated that statins exerted renal benefits that is
independent on the lipid-lowering effect. Rosuvastatin treatment for 8 weeks reduced the
excretion of urinary albumin and suppressed glomerular hypertrophy in db/dbmice even
though blood lipid levels were not altered by drug treatment [59]. In Apo-E knockout mice,
rosuvastatin administration for 20 weeks showed renoprotective effects that are irrelevant to
the lipid-lowering effect [60]. This study showed that rosuvastatin diminished the expression
of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and receptor for advanced glycation and products (RAGE) in
the kidney. Similarly to these reports, although rosuvastatin was effective in ameliorating CKD
progression, rosuvastatin treatment did not affect blood cholesterol levels in our experimental
design. This implies that additional pleiotropic actions might contribute renal benefits of 
rosuvastatin. Indeed, rosuvastatin treatment elevated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1), a
renoprotective anti-inflammatory protein, in our kidney samples (unpublished data). In 
addition, rosuvastatin treatment suppressed pro-fibrotic PAI-1 levels in the kidney as well as
mesangial cells.
PAI-1 blocks plasmin-induced fibrinolysis by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). In addition to this major role in fibrinolysis, PAI-1
is involved in ECM homeostasis by inhibiting the plasmin-induced ECM degradation [23, 24].
The direct link between PAI-1 and renal fibrosis can be drawn from studies with pai-1 null
mice. Unlike wild-type animals, collagen accumulation and interstitial fibrosis were 
significantly reduced in pai-1 null animals following unilateral ureteral obstruction [61]. PAI-1-medi-
ated renal fibrosis is strongly associated with TGF-β1; PAI-1 level and interstitial collagen
deposition were highly increased in TGF-β1 transgenic mice and on the contrary, pai-1 
deficiency prevented TGF-β1-induced renal fibrosis and ECM accumulation [62]. Our results 
indicate that anti-fibrotic effect of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin can be attributed to the inhibitory

effects on PAI-1 and TGF-β1. Sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin treatment reduced collagen 
deposition and suppressed HFD/STZ-induced PAI-1 and TGF-β1 increases in the kidney. In addition,
as shown in vitro, sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin incubation in murine mesangial cells 
suppressed TGF-β1/5-HT-induced PAI-1 elevation. Interestingly, in addition to tissue levels, 
sarpogrelate treatment diminished blood PAI-1 levels that were substantially elevated in HFD/STZ
animals. In humans, there are lines of evidence indicating that increased circulating PAI-1 level
is related with atherothrombosis incidence [28]. Moreover, blood PAI-1 levels were higher in
obese patients with metabolic syndrome and in diabetic patients [26]. Considering that subjects
with metabolic diseases show a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, increased 
circulating PAI-1 levels might be a causative link between metabolic syndrome and atherothrombotic
diseases, and therefore, the inhibitory effect of sarpogrelate on circulating PAI-1 may imply
additional benefits of sarpogrelate for the protection of CKD-induced cardiovascular
complications.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin could effectively 
ameliorate HFD/STZ-induced CKD progression by improving histopathological changes in the 
glomerulus and tubules, and attenuating interstitial fibrosis, albuminuria, and urinary cystatin C
excretion. These drugs inhibited pro-fibrotic PAI-1 expression in HFD/STZ mouse kidney and
mesangial cells, indicating a mechanistic basis for the observed histopathological effects. 
Moreover, combinatorial treatment with sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin was relatively more effective
in ameliorating histopathological changes when compared to the single drug treatment; 
therefore, sarpogrelate may have potential benefits for the control of CKD in patients with metabolic
disorders, particularly in conjunction with statins therapy.
