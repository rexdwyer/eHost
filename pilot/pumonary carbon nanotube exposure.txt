Abstract
Toxicoproteomics is a developing field that utilizes global proteomic methodologies to investigate
the physiological response as a result of adverse toxicant exposure. The aim of this study was to
compare the protein secretion profile in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice
exposed to non-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (U-MWCNTs) or MWCNTs
functionalized by nanoscale Al2O3 coatings (A-MWCNT) formed using atomic layer deposition
(ALD). Proteins were identified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS), and quantified using a combination of two label-free proteomic methods: spectral counting
and MS1 peak area analysis. On average 465 protein groups were identified per sample and
proteins were first screened using spectral counting and the Fisher’s exact test to determine
differentially regulated species. Significant proteins by Fisher’s exact test (p<0.05) were then
verified by integrating the intensity under the extracted ion chromatogram from a single unique
peptide for each protein across all runs. A two sample t-test based on integrated peak intensities
discovered differences in 27 proteins for control versus U-MWCNT, 13 proteins for control versus
A-MWCNT, and 2 proteins for U-MWCNT versus A-MWCNT. Finally, an in-vitro binding
experiment was performed yielding 4 common proteins statistically different (p<0.05) for both the
in-vitro and in-vivo study. Several of the proteins found to be significantly different between
exposed and control groups are known to play a key role in inflammatory and immune response. A
comparison between the in-vitro and in-vivo CNT exposure emphasized a true biological response
to CNT exposure.

1. Introduction
Page 2
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been increasingly investigated for a wide range of
applications since their characterization in 1991 (Vairavapandian et al., 2008). Sumio Iijima
first described CNTs as “needle-like tubes” that range from 4 to 30 nm in diameter and up to
1µm in length (Iijima, 1991). These tubes are now more commonly described as rolled
sheets of hexagonal graphite, being either single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), one
layer, or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), greater than one layer. CNTs have
been tested and reported to be stronger than steel and a fraction of the weight (Thostenson et
al., 2001), thus making them ideal for material additives (Endo et al., 2008). They are also
being investigated in the medical field to serve as a targeted drug delivery vehicle, offering a
larger drug pay load and greater bioavailability (Bonner, 2011). CNTs unique physical
properties make them ideal for various structural support and medical applications; however,
the combination of increased use of CNTs, lack of knowledge of the risks from CNT
exposure (Porter et al., 2010), and the absence of proper safety requirements have all led to a
greater potential for adverse occupational or environmental exposure (Maynard et al., 2004).
One of the greatest concerns over the mass production and use of CNTs is that they possess
fiber-like characteristics similar to asbestos, thus creating the potential for induction of
pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer upon exposure. Several studies have shown that mice or
rats exposed to CNTs by inhalation, oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA), or intratracheal
instillation (IT) develop lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis (Bonner, 2010; 
Ryman-Rasmussen et al., 2009a). CNTs delivered to the lungs of mice are avidly engulfed by
macrophages within the alveolar region (Lam et al., 2004) which produce a variety of
soluble proteins (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, proteinases, extracellular matrix) that play
roles in lung homeostasis, tissue repair, or disease pathogenesis (Mitchell et al., 2007).
Additionally, the lung epithelium produces critical proteins, such as pulmonary surfactant
proteins (Salvador-Morales et al., 2007) and myeloperoxidase (Klebanoff, 2005), as an
innate defense immune response to foreign bodies. Fibrotic response to CNTs in the alveolar
interstitium is caused by the over-production of collagen and other extracellular matrix
proteins by myofibroblasts that result in an increased thickness of the connective tissue
(Mercer et al., 2011). Both the fibrotic and immune responses are likely due to the
generation of reactive oxygen species from residual metal content from the CNTs and the
persistence of CNTs endowed by their fiberlike shape (Bonner, 2011).
A variety of post-synthesis chemical engineering modifications have been developed to
enhance the unique mechanical and electronic properties of CNTs (Prato et al., 2008; Singh
and Kruse 2008). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a novel process used to apply a highly
conformal thin-film coating of oxides, metals, and hybrid metal/organic materials to CNTs
to enhance conductivity, photovoltaic or catalytic applications, and attachment of
biomolecules (Hyde et al., 2009; Parsons et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2007). For example,
aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and titanium oxide change surface functionality of organic fibers,
increase surface hydrophilic properties, and enhance biomolecule attachment (Parsons et al.,
2011; Peng et al., 2009). Zinc oxide or titanium oxide coating imparts increased
photosensitivity of CNTs for photovoltaic or catalytic applications (Peng et al., 2009). ALD

was initially developed for use in the semiconductor industry and has become increasingly
used for work at the nano-scale because of the highly uniform thin film coatings that are
achieved via a sequence of selflimiting reactions (George, 2010; Marichy et al., 2012;
Parsons et al., 2011). ALD modified CNTs are being explored in microelectronics for
enhancing conductivity, and energy storage applications (Marichy et al., 2012). In assessing
the potential hazards of CNTs on human health, it is therefore important to consider CNTs
that are modified by ALD.
Herein, we investigate the variations in protein secretion from mouse lungs following a 24 h
acute exposure to non-functionalized or ALD-functionalized MWCNTs and control via
liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS provides a
powerful platform to evaluate global changes in the proteome as a response to injury or
disease. In this study, protein abundance was quantified by label-free proteomics using both
spectral counts and peak intensities (Asara et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2009). Finally, we
demonstrate the changes in protein expression are the result of specific biological processes
through gene ontology enrichment analysis.
2. Materials and methods
Acetic acid, ammonium bicarbonate, sodium deoxycholate (SDC), dithiothreitol (DTT),
iodoacetamide (IAM), formic acid (FA), ammonium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (HCl),
and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Sequencing grade trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). HPLC gradewater,
methanol, and acetonitrile were purchased from VWR International (Morrisville, NC). The
Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit was purchased through ThermoFisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA). Oasis MCX 30µm particle size solid phase extraction cartridges
were obtained from Waters (Milford, MA).
2.1. Nanomaterials
MWCNT 0.5-40µm in length were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and purchased
from Helix Materials Solutions (Richardson, TX). Characterization of the MWCNTs was
provided by the manufacturer and verified by Millennium Research Laboratories (Woburn,
MA) (Ryman-Rasmussen et al., 2009b). MWCNTs were surface coated with Al2O3 via
atomic layer deposition (ALD). The aluminum oxide layer is achieved using sequential
saturation exposures of trimethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3) and water, then separated by inert
gas purging steps. Based on the known growth rate for the Al2O3 ALD process on
MWCNTs, the nanotubes used in this study had a coating estimated to be ~50 ALD layers
(Fig. 1). The details of ALD coating of carbon nanotubes have been previously described
(Devine et al., 2011).
2.2. Preparation of MWCNTs
Uncoated MWCNTs (U-MWCNT) and aluminum oxide coated (A-MWCNT) were weighed
using a milligram scale (Mettler, Toledo, OH) suspended in a sterile, 0.1% pluronic F-68
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in phosphate buffer solution to achieve the final
concentration of 10 mg/mL. Vials containing the suspended nanomaterials were dispersed

using a cuphorn sonicator (Qsonica, Newton CT) at room temperature for 1 min prior to
dosing. A limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) chromogenic assay (Lonza Inc., Walkersville,
MD) was used to test the nanomaterials for endotoxin contamination. All MWCNTs, both
U-MWCNT and A-MWCNT, tested negative (<0.3 EU/mL) for endotoxin.
2.3. Exposure of mice to MWCNTs and processing of lung tissue
Mice (C57BL6, Jackson Laboratories) approximately 6-8 weeks old were exposed to 
U-MWCNT and A-MWCNT at 4 mg/kg in 0.1% pluronic surfactant solution or 0.1% pluronic
alone for control, via oropharyngeal aspiration while under isoflurane anesthesia. Three
mice per group were evaluated. Mice were euthanized via intraperitoneal injection of Fatal
Plus (Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) on day 1 after MWCNT exposure (Bonner et
al., 2013). At necropsy, the lungs were serially lavaged two times with 0.5 ml Dulbecco’s
Phosphate Buffered Saline and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected. Lung
lavages were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, and isolated away from MWCNTs.
2.4. In solution protein digestion
Samples were quantified by a BCA protein assay, and a final concentration of 50mM total
ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) was achieved by adding the appropriate amount of
ammonium bicarbonate solution to the BALFs. SDC was added to generate a final
concentration of 1% detergent. Disulfides were reduced upon addition of 5mM DTT and
incubated for 30min at 60 °C. Samples were then cooled to room temperature and IAM was
added to make a final concentration of 15mM, and incubated in the dark for 20min at room
temperature. Tryptic digestion was achieved by hydrating lyophilized trypsin to a stock
solution of 1µg/µL with 0.01% acetic acid in water. The trypsin solution was added to the
protein mixture (i.e. 20µg protein) in a 1:50 ratio (~0.4µg trypsin), and then incubated at 37
°C for 4 h. Following the digestion, samples were acidified with 6M HCl to make a final
concentration of 250mM (pH ≤ 3) (Bereman et al., 2012). Sample purification and
concentration was achieved using MCX cartridges. Samples were added to the conditioned
column after steps1-4(SupplementalTable1). After the sample was added to the column,
salts were removed with water (0.1% formic acid), neutrals and negatively charged species
were removedwith1mLofmethanol (0.1%formic acid), andthenpeptides were eluted in 10%
NH4OH in methanol. Finally, samples were concentrated down in vacuo (10 Torr) at 45 °C
for 2 h (speedvac concentrator, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then reconstituted in mobile
phase A (98% water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid) to yield a final concentration
100 ng/µL.
2.5. In-vivo exposure of mouse lung lavage to MWCNTs
Each of the 9 lung lavage samples (3 controls, 3 U-MWCNT exposures, and 3 A-MWCNT
exposures) were isolated from mice as described in the ‘Exposure of mice to MWCNTs and
processing of lung tissue’, and then diluted to 175µL with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate
solution. Sample digestion and purification was achieved as described in the ‘In solution
protein digestion’ section. A final sample concentrationwas 100 ng/µL peptide was prepared
for LC-MS/MS.

grouping (Zhang et al., 2007).
A single lung lavage sample from a control mouse (C57BL6, Jackson Laboratories)was
isolated, as described in the ‘Exposure of mice to MWCNTs and processing of lung tissue.’,
and divided into 3 separate aliquots. The sample was quantified and recorded to be 0.2µg/µL
protein concentration. Each aliquot contained 150µL of 0.1% pluronic solution to yield 30µg
of protein. The designated U- and A-MWCNT samples received 4 mg/kg of respective
MWCNTs in 0.1% pluronic surfactant solution, and the control received 0.1% pluronic
alone to ensure equal concentrations. Samples were incubated and shaken for 24 h at 37 °C
and 180 rpm (MaxQ 4000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubation, samples were
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, and isolated away from MWCNTs. Lung lavages were
further diluted with 400mM ammonium bicarbonate to achieve a final concentration of
50mM in 200µL total volume. Each sample pH was checked and recorded to be 8.0. Sample
digestion was achieved as described in the ‘In solution protein digestion’ section. A final
sample concentration of 0.5µg/µL peptide was prepared for LC-MS/MS.
Nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) was conducted using the Thermo Scientific 
Easy-nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatography system. Pico-Frit columns were purchased from New
Objective (Woburn, MA) and packed to a length of 20cm with reverse phase ReproSil-Pur
120C-18-AQ 3µm particles (Dr. Maisch, Germany). The trap was packed in house to a final
length of 3 cm. A 2µL injection (200 ng total protein) was washed onto the trap at a flow of
2.0 µL/min for 4 min. Peptide separationwas achieved on the LC using a gradient of mobile
phase A (98% water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (100%
acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The 90 min method consisted of an LC gradient with a linear
ramp from 2% B to 40% B across 70 min (2-72 min), a ramp and wash at 80% B (72-78
min), followed by equilibration of the column at 0% B (Supplemental Table 2). Tandem
mass spectrometry was performed using a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Plus in a top 12
mode where the 12 most abundant precursors were selected for fragmentation per full scan.
MS1 and MS2 scans were performed at a resolving power of 70 k and 17.5 k at m/z 200,
respectively. A dynamic exclusion window of 30 s was used to avoid repeated interrogation
of abundant species. Automatic gain control was 1e6 and 5e4 for MS1 and MS2 scans,
respectively. A quality control BSA digest was run every fifth injection to ensure proper 
LC-MS/MS reproducibility. Metrics were monitored in using the Statistical Process Control in
Proteomics algorithm (Bereman et al., 2014).
Database searches were conducted using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and the Sequest 
hyper-threaded algorithm. Data were searched against the Mus musculus Swiss Prot protein
database (number of sequences: 16,657, date accessed: 02/11/2014) (UniProt, 2008). Peptide
spectrum matches were post processed using percolator to enforce a peptide spectral match
threshold of q-value<0.01. The law of strict parsimony was used for protein inference and

The experimental data were exported from Proteome Discoverer as an inclusive tab
delimited file containing each protein group ID and spectral count. A protein’s spectral
count is the total sum of the number of times peptides belonging to that protein were
identified in the experiment. It is a fast method for relative quantification and identification
of putative proteins of interest (Liu et al., 2004). Missing spectral count data for any protein
group (i.e., not identified) was assigned a zero. Each experimental group’s spectral count
data was summed by protein group ID to generate 3 groups of 3 samples each: control, 
U-MWCNT, and A-MWCNT. We first screened the list of proteins identified using the
Fisher’s exact test to calculate p-values based on the combined spectral count of each
protein for each pairwise comparison: control versus U-MWCNT, control versus 
A-MWCNT, and U-MWCNT versus A-MWCNT. Next, these results were further verified by
integrating the summed area under the extracted ion chromatogram of the M, M+ 1, and M+
2 signals of a single unique peptide from each putative protein of interest identified from the
Fisher’s exact test using MS1 full scan filtering in Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010; Schilling
et al., 2012). Spectral libraries were created directly in Skyline from the .msf files and used
in combination with mass measurement accuracy, retention time reproducibility, and isotope
dot products to integrate signals corresponding to peptides of interest. Unique peptides for
each protein were determined using the background proteome database function in Skyline.
The peak area data were log transformed, all zero values were imputed with a value of 10,
and p-values were calculated by using a two-sample t-test for each group (Supplemental
Table 3). Proteins that were identified as significant by both spectral count (p<0.05) and
peak intensity integration (p<0.05) were further analyzed by gene ontology enrichment
analysis using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 database (Huang da et al., 2009).
In-vitro experimental data was processed similarly to the in-vivo experimental data, as
described above. Analytical replicate spectral count datawas summed for each of the 3
samples: control, U-MWCNT, and A-MWCNT. Fisher’s exact test was run for each
pairwise comparison.
3. Results
3.1. In-vivo study
The experimental design for in-vivo mouse exposure to A-MWCNT and U-MWCNT,
followed by lung lavage isolation, protein digestion, LC-MS/MS, and data analysis is shown
in Fig. 2. Fig. 3displays volcano plots in which the log2 fold change is plotted against -log10
p-value generated from the Fisher’s exact test. Of the protein groups identified by
SEQUEST across the sample set, 68 were significantly different by the Fisher’s exact test
(p-value <0.05) in control versus U-MWCNT, 47 significant by control versus A-MWCNT,
and 21 significant by U- versus A-MWCNT. Thus, a greater than 2 fold difference in
number of protein groups significant by Fisher’s exact test were detected between the
control and each MWCNT-exposed group versus the differences between the both of the
exposed groups. Further examination of the significant proteins identified by spectral
counting between the control and U-MWCNT groups were investigated by MS1 peak area
analysis in Skyline. A total of 26 proteins found to be significant by the Fisher’s exact test

Hilton et al.
3.2. In-vitro study
To confirm a true biological response, as opposed to a physical interaction, we conducted an
in-vitro study to probe for potential protein binding with MWCNTs. Of the approximately
500 proteins groups identified, 11 proteins were statistically significant by Fisher’s exact test
(p-value<0.05) for control versus U-MWCNT, and 15 proteins for the control versus 
A-MWCNT as illustrated in the volcano plot in Supplemental Fig. 1. However, only 4 proteins
were identified as significant by the Fisher’s exact test in both the in-vitro and in-vivo study.
These results indicate that the remaining proteins identified as being statistically significant
in the in-vivo study are due to a true biological response and not physical binding of
MWCNTs to proteins.
3.3. Gene ontology analysis
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used to further classify the biological function
of the significant proteins calculated by t-test for the control versus U-MWCNT, and the
control versus A-MWCNT in the in-vivo study. Fig. 5illustrates the GO analysis results for
both biological process and molecular function. Biological processes are (1) considered
molecular events with a beginning and end, and (2) have a vital role in living units (i.e. cells,
tissues, organs, and organisms). Molecular function GO term defines the functions of gene
products in accordance with their abilities. Of the biological process GO terms identified in
the comparison of control versus U-MWCNT, 58% were identified in the category of
response to stimulus, and the remaining 42% were identified in the category of immune
response (Supplemental Table 4). The significant biological process GO terms identified the
control versus A-MWCNT comparison comprised 75% related to a response to stimulus,
and 25% an immune response. The results of the GO analysis for the control versus
MWCNT exposed groups show enrichment for proteins in both immune response, and
response to stimuli.

across all combinations of comparison did not have a unique peptide that could be
confidently integrated using the rules outlined in the methods section due largely to low
signal to noise, and thus were not included in the analysis of the comparisons. Fig.
4illustrates an example of peak area analysis and subsequent t-test results for
myeloperoxidase. Of the significant proteins found by Fisher’s exact test that were further
analyzed by peak area analysis, 27 proteins were found to be significant (p-value<0.05)
between control versus U-MWCNT, 13 proteins were significant between control versus 
A-MWCNT, and 2 proteins were significant between U-MWCNT versus A-MWCNT
(Supplemental Table 3). These results illustrate the more conservative p-value by peptide
peak area analysis compared to spectral counting, which is attributed to a combination of
accounting for the variance amongst the biological replicates inherent in the t-statistic, raw
spectral counts include possible non-unique peptides, and not every protein had a unique
peptide that could be confidently integrated. Fig. 4A illustrates peak area analysis of
myeloperoxidase, a protein associated with innate immune response, where the protein was
not detected in the control, but was detected in both of the exposed groups. Myeloperoxidase
levels across control and exposed groups were not significant in the in-vitro study, and
therefore, are more likely to be a true biological response versus a physical interaction of the
MWCNTs adhering to the protein.

4. Discussion
Page 8
The aim of this study was to investigate proteomic changes upon acute pulmonary exposure
to coated and uncoated MWCNTs. Of the proteins that were found to be statistically
significant by comparing control versus MWCNT exposed groups, several were identified to
be associated with an immune response and/or a response to stimuli, including:
myeloperoxidase (MPO), lacto-transferrin (LTF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL), histone H4, pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B), and complement
(C3, C4b, and C9) proteins. It has been well established that neutrophils use MPO, a
lysosomal enzyme, as an innate immune response to kill microbes by generating hydrogen
peroxide (Gaut et al., 2001; Klebanoff, 2005). In this study we observed significantly
increased levels of MPO expression in both of the exposed groups and no detectable
expression in the control, thus indicating a pulmonary immune response to injury upon
MWCNT exposure. Interestingly, MPO has recently been shown to degrade MWCNTs and
therefore MPO represents a potentially important defense to break down otherwise persistent
nanotubes (Kagan et al., 2010). Moreover, mice deficient in MPO had reduced clearance of
CNTs and enhanced inflammation and fibrosis (Shvedova et al., 2012). Our data show that
uncoated and Al2O3-coated MWCNT both induce MPO protein expression equally in the
lungs of mice. However, it is possible that the Al2O3 coating might alter MPO-induced
degradation of CNTs and this is an important issue to address in future studies.
In addition to MPO, LTF, also known as lactoferrin, is present in neutrophil granules and
plays an important role to bridge the innate and adaptive immune response by aiding cellular
regulation of oxidative stress, as well as, control excess inflammatory response (Actor et al.,
2009). Like MPO, LTF protein expression was also significantly increased upon both 
U-MWCNT and A-MWCNT exposure which indicates an up regulated process to control for
inflammatory response in the lung. Additional evidence of innate immune response and
inflammatory induction by MWCNT exposure was found by the increased expression of
NGAL in both U-MWCNT and A-MWCNT exposure compared to the control, and an
increase in histone H4 in the U-MWCNT exposed groups compared to control. NGAL is
known to be expressed by immune cells and serves to modulate oxidative stress, and when
reactive oxygen species are generated upon exposure, DNA damage can occur and release
histone H4 and serve as a marker for inflammatory response (Chakraborty et al., 2012;
Tambor et al., 2013). Along with NGAL and histone H4, immune defense systems, such as
the complement component system, have been detected for up regulation upon MWCNT
exposure. The complement system, containing more than 30 proteins, is considered to play a
vital role in innate immune response, and can be activated through three major pathways:
classical, lectin, and alternative (Dunkelberger and Song, 2010). Initiation of the classical
pathway occurs through antigen/antibody immune complexes, the lectin pathway occurs by
lectins recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and the alternative
pathway is activated by interaction with pathogenic surfaces. Our data analysis showed
statistically significant differences in complement components C9, C3, and C4b in the 
U-MWCNT exposed group compared to the control. C9 is a part of the terminal complement
component system that serves to initiate membrane attack on certain pathogens and cells. C3
protein acts through the alternative pathway and is broken down by C3 convertase to C3b, a

5. Conclusion
This study examined changes in protein abundance associated with immune response and
inflammation were detected in mice lung BALF after 24 h exposure to functionalized and
non-functionalized MWCNTs. These experiments demonstrated the ability to use 
LC-MS/MS to probe for global changes in lung lavage fluid upon pulmonary insult to carbon
nanotubes. Differences in protein expression were screened by examining spectral count
data and further verified by peak area analysis of a single unique peptide. Investigation of
the potential protein interaction with CNTs was conducted as an in-vitro study to examine
whether biological changes in protein expression occur upon toxicant exposure versus
protein binding with the CNTs. Further protein binding studies are needed to examine
potential protein interaction with various functionalized CNTs. Future studies will use
protein cleavage isotope dilution mass spectrometry to validate the absolute changes in
protein amounts and examine the differences in protein expression across multiple types of
MWCNT functionalization. In addition, we will use global proteomic approaches to
investigate perturbations of intracellular pathways in relation to carbon nanotube
degree of toxicity of a variety of carbon nanotube coatings.

protein that binds complement receptors on phagocytes, and C3a, a mediator of
inflammation. Lastly, C4b acts as an opsonin on the surface of targeted cells. All three
complement components were up regulated in U-MWCNT exposure compared to the
control, thus indicating activation of the complement component system as an innate
immune response.
Another key protein group known to induce immune response are the pulmonary surfactant
proteins (SP), including: SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D. Surfactant proteins compose a major
component of pulmonary surfactant which is essential for maintaining lung homeostasis as it
prevents alveolar collapse (Wright, 2005). Induction of immune response has been shown to
be enhanced by SP-B containing antigen vesicles within the airways (van Iwaarden et al.,
2001). Our proteomic analysis demonstrated that of the 3 common surfactant proteins, only
SP-B was statistically significant in the comparison of U-MWCNT versus control.
Interestingly, SP-B was detected in lower levels for both of the exposed groups compared to
the control, thus following the trend previously observed with SP-A and SP-D where the
proteins were bound to the CNTs (Salvador-Morales et al., 2007). The reduction in SP-B
levels could be indicative of an immune response whereby the secreted proteins are adhering
to the CNTs. However, none of the surfactant proteins were significant by the in-vitro study,
indicating that the binding of the surfactant proteins to the CNTs may be concentration
and/or environment dependent.
Comparing the different MWCNT (Al2O3-coated versus uncoated) exposure groups yielded
little differences in protein abundances, thus indicating the major response in this specific
study was due to CNT exposure. However, more precise absolute quantitative LC-MS/MS
methods are needed to screen a variety of different coatings based on the markers identified
herein and will be the subject of future studies.

to develop targeted peptide assays based on selected reaction monitoring to determine

Transmission electron photomicrographs of (A) non-functionalized MWCNTs and (B) ALD  
Al2O3-functionalized MWCNTs.

General overview of sample preparation and data analysis. (A) Mouse exposure  
toMWCNTs, (B) lung lavage extraction, (C) tryptic digestion of lung lavage and SPE  
sample clean up, (D) LC-MS/MS, and (E) Label-free protein quantification by: (a) spectral  
counting, and (b) verification by MS1 peak area analysis of unique peptides.

Fig. 3.  
Volcano plots of log2 spectral count fold change versus-log10 p-value calculated by Fisher’s  
exact test for: (A) U-MWCNT/control, (B) A-MWCNT/control, and (C) U-MWCNT/A- 
MWCNT. Proteins plotted as a log2 fold change of 3 and -3 represent protein detection in  
exposed groups, but not control, and vice versa (respectively). Positive fold change in  
spectral count data represent up-regulation in exposed groups versus the control. Shaded  
areas highlight significance of p<0.05. Abundant proteins (i.e., human serum albumin) were  
included in calculations of the Fisher’s exact test, but not shown in plots. α = Pulmonary  
surfactant-associated protein-B. β =Myeloperoxidase. γ = Lactotransferrin.

Fig. 4.  
Peak area analysiswas conducted on proteins that were discovered to be significant using the  
Fisher’s Exact test on the spectral count data. (A) Chromatogram overlay used to assess  
changes in peak area by group. (B) Peak area was tested for significance across every group  
using the two-sample t-test: Control versus U-MWCNT (p = 7.02E- 08), Control versus A- 
MWCNT (p = 3.96E-05), and U-MWCNT versus A-MWCNT = 0.679). *Control peak area  
= 0, but imputed as a value of 10 to allow for log adjustment. Peaks were identified using a  
combination of MS2 identification (blue lines), mass measurement accuracy (<3 ppm), dot  
products of theoretical isotope abundance, and retention time reproducibility (For  
interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the  
web version of this article.).

GO analysis terms for (A) Biological Process, and (B) Molecular Function for significant  
proteins by peak area analysis both of the exposed groups versus the control. Significance  
(p<0.05) was calculated by a modified Fisher’s exact test (EASE score) and adjusted by the  
Benjamini correction and reported as the −log10 Benjamini p-value. Significant GO terms  
are illustrated to the right of the dashed line (Huang da et al., 2009).
