Abstract
Background: A convergence of technological breakthroughs in the past decade has facilitated the development of
rapid screening tools for biomarkers of toxicant exposure and effect. Platforms using the whole adult organism to
evaluate the genome-wide response to toxicants are especially attractive. Recent work demonstrates the feasibility
of this approach in vertebrates using the experimentally robust zebrafish model. In the present study, we evaluated
gene expression changes in whole adult male zebrafish following an acute 24 hr high dose exposure to three
metals with known human health risks. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to nickel chloride, cobalt chloride or
sodium dichromate concentrations corresponding to their respective 96 hr LC20, LC40 and LC60. Histopathology
was performed on a subset of metal-exposed zebrafish to phenotypically anchor transcriptional changes associated
with each metal.
Results: Comparative analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed transcripts both overlapping and unique
to each metal. Application of gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor (TF) enrichment algorithms revealed a
number of key biological processes perturbed by metal poisonings and the master transcriptional regulators
mediating gene expression changes. Metal poisoning differentially activated biological processes associated with
ribosome biogenesis, proteosomal degradation, and p53 signaling cascades, while repressing oxygen-generating
pathways associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism. Despite appreciable effects on gene regulation, nickel
poisoning did not induce any morphological alterations in male zebrafish organs and tissues. Histopathological
effects of cobalt remained confined to the olfactory system, while chromium targeted the gills, pharynx, and
intestinal mucosa. A number of enriched transcription factors mediated the observed gene response to metal
poisoning, including known targets such as p53, HIF1α, and the myc oncogene, and novel regulatory factors such as
XBP1, GATA6 and HNF3β.
Conclusions: This work uses an experimentally innovative approach to capture global responses to metal poisoning
and provides mechanistic insights into metal toxicity.

Background
Toxicogenomics is a powerful tool for evaluating toxicity
profiles of known and potentially hazardous compounds.
The zebrafish, a classic model for developmental toxicity,
has recently proven to be an effective model organism for
chemical screening [1,2] and environmental sentinel

applications, including sewage testing and chemical
hazard detection [3-6]. The low husbandry costs, small
size, ease of genetic manipulation, and wealth of genome
database resources distinguish the zebrafish as a highly
promising model organism for toxicological studies.
Responses to toxic insults usually affect multiple organs
and tissues, supporting a role for gene profiling in the
whole animal to evaluate toxic responses. Although whole
organism toxicogenomics has routinely been conducted in
invertebrate models such as the worm Caenorhabditis
elegans and the fly Drosophila melanogaster [7-9] and
in ecoindicator species such as Daphnia magna and

Pimpephales promelas [10,11], only one study to date
has evaluated whole organism gene profiling in adult
zebrafish [12]. In this study, robust expression signatures
differentiated between potent aryl hydrocarbon and
estrogen receptor agonists, and accurately identified target
tissues. We hypothesized that gene profiling in whole
adult zebrafish could also be used to infer toxic responses
to hazardous chemicals.
Nickel, cobalt and chromium are environmentally
ubiquitous metals with recognized human health hazards
[13]. Recently, applications in mining, smelting, industry,
medicine, and agriculture have increased the environmental
distribution of these metals, elevating elevated exposure
risk and incidences of occupational exposure. Nickel,
cobalt, or chromium exposure can cause incapacitating
acute toxicity and/or long-term damage (e.g., carcinogenesis)
[14-16]. Primary mechanisms of metal toxicity include
the production of free radicals which can trigger oxidative
stress, induce mutagenesis by DNA-metal interactions, and
impair protein function by covalently modifying proteins
or competing with metal binding sites. Metal-derived
reactive oxygen species (ROS) may perturb a number of
tightly regulated cellular processes (e.g., cell growth and
proliferation), activate transcription factors and genes, and
trigger cellular adaptive programs including metal stress
response, DNA repair mechanisms, and inflammation [17].
Numerous studies have examined gene responses to
acute poisoning by nickel, cobalt, or chromium [18,19], but
besides a few studies in invertebrates, most of these studies
measure gene responses in isolated tissues or tissue-derived
cell lines [8,19-23]. Although analyzing isolated tissues is
the ideal approach to unambiguously identify gene changes
in an organ of interest, it is experimentally impractical to
microdissect and to analyze all potentially affected organs
from zebrafish individually. Alternatively, a whole-organism
approach with post hoc gene ontology enrichment analysis
has the advantage of predicting biomolecular pathways
linked to observed histopathologic endpoints for informing
later organ-specific experiments. In this study, we used a
whole-organism approach exposing adult male zebrafish to
increasing concentrations of nickel chloride, cobalt
chloride, and sodium dichromate, and evaluating whole
genome transcriptional responses using DNA microarrays.
We identified differentially regulated biological processes
using gene ontology enrichment analysis in order to infer
toxicity mechanisms [21]. We also identified transcription
factors upstream of the differentially enriched genes
which are predicted to directly activate or repress
gene expression in order to characterize regulatory
processes involved in metal toxicity. Histopathological
changes in the whole organism were compared with
gene changes. Overall, our study provides (i) insight
into transcriptomic changes corresponding to toxic
indicators of metal poisoning and (ii) an experimental

evaluation of whole organism toxicogenomics in the
zebrafish model.
Methods
Research was conducted in compliance with the United
States Animal Welfare Act, and other Federal statutes
and regulations relating to animals and experiments
involving animals and adheres to principles stated in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NRC 2011) in facilities that are fully accredited by the
Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care, International. Approvals were
granted for this study by USACEHR’s Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Water quality
All husbandry and aquatic exposures are performed
using USACEHR’s well water which is processed to 
ensure proper conditioning of the water supply. The water
is supplied from a mix of onsite ground water wells and
from municipal tap (domestic) water. Domestic water is
used to produce “RO permeate” which is later mixed
with raw well water to produce water of appropriate
hardness and alkalinity (150 - 210 mg/L as CaCO3;
110 - 180 mg/L as CaCO3 respectively). Domestic
water is carbon filtered to remove chlorine levels
(maintained below 0.1 mg/L), treated by a water softener,
processed through reverse osmosis (RO) membranes then
stored for distribution. Prior to use, the RO processed
domestic water is blended with well water, filtered
through a 10 μm particle filter, carbon filtered, then
heated and aerated to near 100% saturation at 25 ± 1°C.
This processed water is then passed through another 10
μm particle filter and UV sterilized prior to distribution
throughout the facility. This water is continuously 
monitored to maintain the following ranges: pH = 6.5 - 8.5;
alkalinity = 110 - 180 mg/L CaCO3; hardness = 150 -
210 mg/L as CaCO3; conductivity = 400 - 1000 mS/cm;
total ammonia < 0.1 mg/L as NH3; dissolved oxygen
(DO) = 80 - 100% saturation (6.8 - 8.5 mg/L at 25°C).
Contaminant analysis is performed quarterly by our
in-house analytical chemistry department as well as
annually by an external, certified testing facility.
Fish exposures
Exposures were conducted using USACEHR well water
in 5-gallon glass aquaria adapted for flow-through use
(60 mL/min; 5.4 turnovers/day) and maintained at 25°C
with a 12 hr:12 hr (light:dark) photoperiod. During both
acclimation and exposure periods, water quality for each
tank is monitored daily (temperature, pH, alkalinity,
hardness, DO, and conductivity (data not shown). We
estimated the concentration of each metal necessary for
20% (LC20; low), 40% (LC40; mid) and 60% lethality
Hussainzada et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/15
(LC60; high) in 96 hr range-finding experiments.
Exposures were conducted for 24 hr using control
(no toxicant) plus the high, mid and low concentrations of
each metal (Table 1). Our intent with this exposure
paradigm was to evaluate levels of toxicant sufficient to
induce a measurable intoxication response without
producing lethality at 24 hours. Metal concentrations
in the test tanks were verified by our analytical chemistry
department before and after exposures.
Only male zebrafish were included in the analysis
because of concern that RNAs encoding vitellogenin
and other liver-abundant egg proteins found in breeding
females [24,25] might confound global gene expression
studies. Therefore, we initially selected 25 adult (6-9
months) presumptive male zebrafish per condition to
ensure that 20 male fish were available for subsequent
microarray analysis and histopathology. During exposure,
animals received a pre-measured quantity of food twice
per day (1X flake food, 1X brine shrimp). After the
exposure period, fish were euthanized by immersion
in a lethal concentration (0.5 g/L, pH 7.2) of MS-222.
Five fish per condition were immediately preserved in a
modified Davidson’s solution for histological examination.
For transcriptional analysis, the remaining 15 zebrafish
were immersed whole in liquid nitrogen and stored at
−80°C until RNA processing.
Histopathology
Slides were prepared by Experimental Pathology
Laboratories, Inc. (EPL, Inc., Sterling, VA). Briefly,
the fish were initially preserved in modified Davidson’s
solution, washed in 70% ethanol, and then transferred to
10% neutral buffered formalin for transport. Fish required
additional decalcification prior to sectioning and were
placed in Formical 2000® decalcification fluid for seven
hours. Tails were removed from each fish, followed by
processing and embedding in paraffin. Vertical longitudinal
sections were obtained at five different levels: 1) left lateral,
2) left paramedian, 3) midline sagittal, 4) right paramedian,
and 5) right lateral. Two serial sections were obtained at
each level for a total of 10 sections per fish that were H&E
stained. The following tissues were evaluated (if present)
for each zebrafish: bone (vertebra), brain, corpuscle of
Stannius, esophagus, eye, gallbladder, gills, heart, gonad
(ovary), gonad (testis), hematopoietic tissue, interrenal
tissue, intestine, kidney, liver, mesonephric duct, nares,
Nominal and actual concentrations (mg/L) of metals used in the definitive 24-hour zebrafish exposures as estimated from 96-hour range finding studies.

pancreas, peripheral nerve, pineal organ, pituitary,
pseudobranch, skeletal muscle, skin, spinal cord, spleen,
stato-acoustic organ, swim bladder, thymus, thyroid, and
ultimobranchial body. The following tissues occasionally
were not present in the sections that were evaluated:
corpuscle of Stannius, esophagus, gallbladder, interrenal
tissue, mesonephric duct, pineal organ, pituitary, spleen,
thymus, thyroid, and ultimobranchial body. Occasional
absence of these tissues is a condition inherent in the
sectioning method and did not appear to affect the overall
evaluation of the histopathology data.
Microarray analysis
RNA processing
Whole frozen fish were pulverized under liquid nitrogen
using a SPEX 6750 freezer mill (SPEX Sample Prep,
Metuchen, NJ). Total RNA was isolated from the
pulverized material using Trizol® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) with an extra clarification centrifugation step to
remove bone, scales, lipid, and other insoluble debris
followed by column purification with RNeasy® Midi kits
(Qiagen, GmbH, Germany) to remove residual salt and
organic solvents. Total RNA quality and quantity were
evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA) and verified using the NanoDrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington,
DE). A portion of each total RNA preparation was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the Advantage® RT-for-PCR
Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and screened against
a primer panel designed to verify that RNA was isolated
from male fish. Specifically, we measured levels of
transcripts coding for vitellogenin 1 (vit1, expressed
only in female liver, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was used as an internal
control for normalizing the sample RNA and cDNA
concentrations. Our initial PCR screen was critical as
multiple RNA samples were pooled for microarray
analysis (see below) and the presence of female RNA
within the pool would complicate analysis.
Microarray hybridization
To maximize statistical power and minimize cost, we
pooled equal amounts of total RNA from four or five fish
within each exposure condition to create a biological
replicate pool and hybridized each replicate pool to a
separate microarray; generating four biological replicate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/15
pools per experimental condition for a total of 16 
microarrays per toxicant screened (i.e. four control replicates, four
low dose replicates, four mid dose replicates and four high
dose replicates). Statistical modeling demonstrates that
performing microarray analysis on four biological
replicates comprised of RNA pooled from five samples
approaches the statistical power attained by analyzing 20
individual samples [26]. Numerous theoretical discussions
of the pooling procedure can be found in the literature
[27-29]. Although pooling eliminates the ability to assess
fish-to-fish variability in gene expression, it does provide a
statistically powerful approach to identify clear toxicant
responses, which is the main focus of the current work.
The microarrays used in this study were custom
designed in-house using the eArray microarray design
tool (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/; Agilent
Technologies, Inc.) and manufactured by Agilent. Each
array contains 44,000 60-mer oligonucleotides representing
21,904 zebrafish gene targets derived from Ensembl build
46 (Zv7 genome build) and Vega build 26. Two probes
were designed per transcript wherever possible; only 94
target transcripts have only one probe. Probes were
designed using genes that are annotated, i.e., matched to
named genes in the published databases, and represent
good coverage of the whole zebrafish genome.
Microarrays were processed following Agilent’s
One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis
Protocol (Version 5.5, February, 2007) for processing
4 x 44 K microarray slides using an initial 1 μg pooled
RNA input and an 18 hr overnight hybridization at 65°C.
A final step for preventing ozone related degradation
of signal using the Stabilization and Drying solution
(Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was included after the required
specificity washes prior to scanning the arrays. Microarray
slides were scanned with a GenePix Autoloader 4200 AL
scanner (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and raw
images processed using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular
Devices). All microarray data from this study have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus under the
accession number GSE50648.
Statistical analysis
Raw microarray data was analyzed with Partek Genomics
Suite software with probe intensities based on the median
signal intensity of each feature and signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) data imported from GenePix Pro 6.0. GenePix Pro
calculates SNR as the difference between median spot
signal and median background divided by the standard
deviation of the background signal. Data preprocessing
comprised manual inspection of each extracted gene
feature and quality control. We selected only unsaturated
probes with an SNR greater than or equal to three
(SNR ≥ 3) for analysis and performed quantile
normalization across arrays to control for inter-array
Page 4 of 15
variability. Normalized probe intensities were then log
transformed. We also removed probes without Ensembl
annotation producing a subset of 15,818 probes which
mapped to 7,909 genes (Additional file 1: Table S1). We
performed three sets of ANOVAs using Partek Genomics
Suite to identify probes that were differentially expressed
between each treatment group and its respective control.
Each set consisted of data from all the replicate pools of
fish exposed to a specific metal and the replicate pools of
unexposed fish housed in adjacent tanks during the metal
exposure. The ANOVA model included terms for
treatment (unexposed or exposed), concentration
(control, low, mid, or high) and in interaction term
for treatment*concentration. Contrasts were performed to
determine significance between each concentration and
control. We used a step-up Benjamini and Hochberg false
discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 to select differentially
expressed probes. An FDR alpha value equal to 0.01 was
chosen as the cut-off for the combined datasets of all
replicate pools. Probes not meeting this threshold were
filtered out and the resultant list was submitted to a
second filter specifying a 1.8-fold-difference between
treated vs. control samples. Only transcripts for which
probes passed these filters were included in the final list
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Fold changes for each probe
pair (single probe transcripts excluded) were then
averaged to generate a single value for each transcript.
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed
using the web-based tool GOTree Machine (GOTM;
http://genereg.ornl.gov/gotm/), which generates a tree-like
structure to navigate the GO Directed Acyclic Graph for
input gene sets. GOTM supports analysis of the zebrafish
genome; however, this analysis had to be performed at the
gene rather than the transcript level. GO term and
KEGG pathway (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/)
enrichment analyses were then performed on the secondary
lists to determine biological processes that are significantly
(FDR = 0.1) enhanced or depressed by each metal. The
enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were also
manually annotated into top level biological categories
to clarify the overarching biological “themes” related to
metal-induced gene perturbations. Finally, transcription
factor enrichment was performed using MetaCore’s
algorithm (GeneGo, Inc.) with settings enabled for
identification of node relationships encompassing only
direct downstream transcriptional regulation. Zebrafish
genes were mapped to their human homologs using the
Biomart feature in Ensembl with genes mapping one-to-
many discarded from subsequent analysis. Background
reference sets comprised the set of all transcripts with
SNR ≥ 3 in each platform that could be subsequently
mapped in a one-to-one fashion to their human homologs.
Thresholds were set at an FDR = 0.1 with at least three
DEG target identified for each enriched transcription factor.
Hussainzada et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/15
Metacore does not explicitly provide zebrafish 
transcription factor regulatory networks; however, we anticipated
that there would be high degree of conservation between
the zebrafish and human networks [30], and mapped the
zebrafish DEGs to their human orthologs before performing
enrichment. Each differentially expressed transcript was
mapped to its corresponding gene using the Ensembl
database and resultant gene lists queried against their
appropriate reference gene lists. Background reference
sets comprised the set of all transcripts with SNR ≥ 3 in
each exposure condition that could be subsequently
mapped to Ensembl genes. Significantly enriched GO terms,
or those GO terms that are statistically over-represented in
each treatment compared to the reference set, were
determined using the hypergeometric test with p-values
adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg FDR correction
(α = 0.1) and setting a threshold for the minimum number
of genes per category (n = 3). While many statistical tests
have been used for GO enrichment evaluation, the
hypergeometric distribution provides an appropriate method
for modeling data in which genes can be selected only once,
i.e. sampling without replacement, as occurs
in GO
enrichment analysis [31].
Results and discussion
Gross changes, behavior, and histopathology
Figure 1 provides a schematic of the experimental
paradigm. During range-finding metal exposure studies,
fish were qualitatively assessed for gross changes in behavior
Page 5 of 15
and general appearance. At study termination, tissues
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to
determine the morphological changes associated with each
metal poisoning at the concentrations listed in Table 1.
Nickel-exposed fish appeared fuzzy, an appearance which
is generally attributable to the excretion of mucus from
goblet cells following irritation (personal communication,
Dr. Donald K. Nichols). There were no deaths observed at
any of the nickel concentrations nor did any of the nickel
concentrations lead to any discernible histopathologic
alterations (Table 2) although behavioral differences and
skin abnormalities were qualitatively different between
control and treated fish (i.e. sluggish swimming and fuzzy
skin appearance). Previous studies indicate that gills, liver,
and kidney are histopathological targets of nickel poisoning
[22,23,32-34], but differences in fish species, exposure time
and concentration could account for the discrepancy in the
histopathological endpoints.
Chromium poisoning caused visible changes in fish
behavior and general appearance, including sluggish
swimming, gasping and ulcerations near the tail in some
fish. Four zebrafish died at the highest dose. Exposure to
all three concentrations of chromium histopathologically
affected the gills, intestine, and pharynx (see Table 2 and
Figure 2A). Both gill and pharynx epithelium exhibited
mononuclear cell infiltration, which is indicative of acute
inflammation. The most prominent change in intestine
was moderate to moderately severe atrophy of the mucosal
folds and a mild infiltration of the intestinal lamina propria

Morphological alterations
No significant changes observed in any tissues examined.
Acute damage only to the olfactory organs including various inflammatory, degenerative, metaplastic, and necrotic lesions extending
from the nasal cavity to the lungs. Intranasal lesions include olfactory epithelium necrosis (5 L, 5 M, 5H), lymphocytic inflammation
(3 L, 4 M, 4 H), reactive hyperplasia (0 L, 0 M, 1 H), and olfactory lamellae fusion (0 L, 1 M, 3 H).
Acute damage only to the gills, intestine, and pharynx. Gills exhibited multifocal lesions consisting of lamellar fusion (4 L, 4 M, 5 H),
epithelial hyperplasia (3 L, 4 M, 5 H), mononuclear cell infiltration (1 C, 4 L, 4 M, 5 H), epithelial necrosis (0 L, 4 M, 5 H), presence of
thrombi in vessels (0 L, 4 M, 3 H) and hemorrhage (0 L, 2 M, 3 H). Intestine exhibits moderate to moderately severe atrophy of the
mucosal folds (5 L, 5 M, 5 H), mild mononuclear infiltration of the lamina propria (5 L, 5 M, 5H) and mild necrosis of mucosal epithelium
(2 L, 3 M, 3 H). Pharynx exhibits epithelial atrophy characterized by decreased mucosal thickness and loss of mucous secreting cells; also
accompanied by mononuclear cell infiltration (0 L, 2 M, 4 H). Necrosis of pharyngeal epithelium occurred in 1 H.
Histopathological perturbations in zebrafish exposed to nickel, cobalt, or chromium for 24 hours. A total of five fish were examined per concentration including
the control. In each case the numbers of instances of a finding are indicated in parentheses. C = control, L = low, M =mid and H = high concentration.
with mononuclear cells. Earlier studies report that the gills,
kidney, and liver are histopathological targets of hexavalent
chromium exposure in several species of freshwater fish
[35,36]. The histopathology associated with this study
supports the hypothesis that chromium exposure affects
certain physiological processes including respiration,
metabolic regulation, and possibly feeding.
During the cobalt range-finding studies, zebrafish
exposed to high doses showed less schooling behavior,
more surfacing, and less overall movement than the
controls. In zebrafish, these behaviors are usually indicative
of abnormal respiration and physiological stress. There
were six deaths at the high dose and one death at the mid
dose. Histopathology confirmed that zebrafish exposed
to all three concentrations of cobalt presented with
respiratory tract lesions specific to the olfactory epithelium
(see Figure 2B and Table 2). The gill epithelium was
unaffected, suggesting that the olfactory epithelial injury is
specific to cobalt rather than a nonspecific reaction to
waterborne irritants. Consistent with these results,
inhalation studies in rats and mice confirm cobalt-specific
morphological damage to the olfactory epithelia [37].
NOEL (no-observable-effect-level) could not be determined
for any of the structural changes observed in fish treated
with cobalt at the concentrations we tested.
Transcriptomic responses to metal poisonings
To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulting
from nickel, cobalt, or chromium exposure, we compared
the expression of genes in whole fish exposed to each
metal with unexposed controls. Chromium, cobalt, or
nickel exposure significantly altered expression of 696,
461, and 287 genes, respectively (Figure 3). There was a
steep concentration-response relationship between
mortality and metal concentration, with relatively little
difference in the gene response to the three poisoning
concentrations in the surviving fish as assessed by
principal components analysis and analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The concentrations were chosen to evoke
histopathologic changes in an acute setting. Thus, the
observed lack of an appreciative concentration-response
curve would result if the doses fell in a nearly vertical
region of the typical sigmoidal dose-response curve.
Dose-dependent effects may have been lost in 
experimental variation. Lower doses or a longer time interval may be
necessary to elicit a true dose-response curve.
Biological processes perturbed by metal exposures
DEG lists were further subdivided into secondary lists by
direction of response: for example, of the 287 genes
induced by nickel, 97 were down-regulated and 190 were
up-regulated. GO term enrichment analysis and KEGG
pathway enrichment analysis inferred biological processes
modified by each metal. The biological processes
identified in the gene ontology enrichment analyses
(GO biological processes and KEGG pathways) fell
into five categories with differential responses for the
three metals: protein synthesis and translation; altered
reduction-oxidation (redox) levels; inflammation and acute
phase stress response; cell cycle regulation and apoptosis;
and metabolic depression (Figure 4 and Table 3). Table 3
summarizes the biological processes, chemistries and
toxicities and results of pathway enrichment analysis for
metals compared to histopathologic findings. Biological
processes identified in the transcriptomic analysis were
compared at the pathway level to published mechanisms
of aquatic toxicology. In general, metals affect the cellular
heme content, impairing oxidative function of cells
[13,38-40]. Consistent with this observation, all three
metals showed down-regulation in biological processes
associated with the oxidative stress response, including
oxidation-reduction (Figure 4A) and metabolic pathways
in the oxidative stress response (Figure 4B). Further, all
three metals induced genes in GO biological processes
(most notably ribosome biogenesis) and KEGG pathways
regulating protein synthesis and translation (Figure 4A
and B). Increased demand for newly synthesized proteins
may result from enhanced requirements for translation of
stress responsive genes particularly those involved in
combating oxidative and inflammatory stress. It is also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/15
possible that the enhanced protein synthesis is a 
compensatory mechanism to replenish cells lost through apoptosis
in tissues specifically targeted by metal exposures. The
literature is conflicting regarding ribosome biogenesis in
response to toxicant poisoning [41-46]. The discrepancies
in our study between metals may reflect differences in the
severity of toxic insult among the metals.
Nickel poisoning causes oxidative damage to DNA and
inhibits antioxidant defenses [47-49]. Nickel-poisoned
fish had less observable histopathology than the other
metals and no histopathology directly attributable to
nickel poisoning, but gene expression was more enriched
in processes involving cell cycle regulation and apoptosis
(Figure 4A) and protein synthesis and translation than the
other metals (Figure 4A and B). The lack of 
histopathological signs of nickel poisoning at 24 hr may suggest that
our nickel exposure scheme captures mechanisms which
drive the initial response to metal poisoning (i.e. at 24 hr)
prior to histologic alterations.
Cobalt poisoning mimics hypoxia, stimulating the
production of reactive oxygen species and increasing
lipid peroxides [50]. Consistent with this observation,
cobalt showed more up-regulation of genes regulating the
biological processes of the oxidative stress response than
any other metal (Figures 4A and B).
Chromium redox cycling and ROS generation induce
DNA damage and activate subsequent repair mechanisms
[51,52]. Corroborating these mechanisms, chromium 
up-regulated p53 and MAPK signaling pathways (Figure 4B)
[53]. Genes associated with inflammation and acute phase
stress responses were up-regulated more with chromium
than the other metals (Figure 4A and B). These results
are consistent with the histopathology observations that
chromium exposure induced the most inflammatory cell
Page 8 of 15
infiltration (Figure 2 and Table 2). The genes in pathways
associated with metabolic depression support a molecular
mechanism underlying the reduced feeding behavior and
intestinal abnormalities observed in chromium exposed
fish (Figure 2). Chromium poisoning was associated with
a marked down-regulation in genes involved in cellular
metabolism, including lipid and steroid metabolic
pathways. These processes included the citrate (TCA)
cycle and fatty acid metabolism, which are regulated
by degradation of amino acids into acetyl-CoA and
proprionyl-CoA intermediates respectively [54]. Genes
controlling the biological and molecular processes
controlling the processing of pyruvate, a degradation
product of glucogenic amino acids, also significantly
decreased in fish exposed to chromium (Figure 4A).
These results suggest that chromium poisoning, but
not cobalt or nickel, caused significant reductions in
metabolic capacity, particularly for amino acids and
processes associated with their metabolic by-products.
These results are consistent with the observed intestinal
mucosa atrophy and mild necrosis (Figure 2A). Chromium
is readily absorbed by the intestinal tissue. Since gut
mucosa represents the primary site for whole-body amino
acid metabolism [55,56], mucosal atrophy can significantly
diminish the gut’s amino acid metabolic capacity and
decrease amino acid requirements and use.
Enriched transcription factors in response to metal
poisoning
We performed transcription factor (TF) enrichment
analysis using Metacore on each secondary enhanced/
repressed gene list in an attempt to identify upstream
regulatory networks that mediate metal induced gene
expression linked to GO biological processes (Figure 5,
Table 3, and Additional file 1: Table S1). The metals showed
a significant discrepancy in the type and direction of the
regulation of the transcription factors expressed (Figure 5A).
Common to all metals was the up-regulation of the highly
conserved mini-chromosome maintenance 4 (mcm4) gene
with DNA helicase activity essential for the inhibition of
eukaryotic genome replication and the origin recognition
complex (orc61) which facilitates replication [57-60]
(Figure 5B, Table 3, and Additional file 1: Table S1).
In nickel poisoning, transcripts for the DNA replication
processes genes mcm3, mcm5, and rbb4 were up-regulated
in addition to mcm4 and orc61 (Table 3, Figure 5B, and
Additional file 1: Table S1). Nickel induced transcription
factor changes consistent with redox signaling, including
up-regulation of hif1α and xbp1 (Figure 5A and Table 3)
and their associated gene targets (Figure 5B and Table 3).
These gene products are cellular regulators that sense
oxygen status and trigger adaptive cascades to maintain
normoxia [61-63]. It is known that nickel stabilizes Hif-1α
by preventing the degradation of the protein either
Ni Co CrA
through the depletion of ascorbate or by replacing
iron in the hydroxylases responsible for Hif-1α 
degradation [64-66], leading to transcriptional activation
of downstream targets. In our study, nickel poisoning
up-regulated other genes critical for redox sensing
and homeostasis, including periredoxin (zgc:110343),
thioredoxin (zgc:92903), thioredoxin-like 1 (txnl1), and
protein disulfide isomerase 4 and 5 (pdia4, pdip5)
(Additional file 1: Table S1 and Figure 5B). Levels of hif1α
downstream targets (abcf2, pfkfb3, il1b, egln3, hk2) were
significantly up-regulated. xbp1 expression was enhanced
1.52 fold in parallel with robust up-regulation of its gene
targets (hspa5, pdia4, dnajb11) (Figure 5A and B). The
xpb1 gene target hspa5 (which encodes Grp78/BiP) also
represents a specific and key marker for induction of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) [67-69], an adaptive
response that prevents protein aggregation by enhancing
expression of molecular chaperones and diminishing
nascent polypeptide flux into the ER [70,71]. Nickel 
dose-dependently increased expression of hspa5 (Figure 5B).
Surprisingly, nickel poisoning did not induce genes
involved in clearing terminally misfolded proteins
(i.e. members of the ER-associated protein degradation
machinery [ERAD] family) (Additional file 1: Table S1 and
Figure 5B) [71]. However, nickel poisonings up-regulated
an additional ensemble of ER chaperones (dnaja4,
jnajb11, ahsa11, hsp701, hspe1, hsp90b1, hspa41) which
play a crucial role in ensuring proper protein folding.
Taken together, our data suggest that nickel exposures
induced the UPR via xbp1 transcriptional activation.
Cobalt poisoning resulted in up-regulation of only
hnf3β in the Metacore analysis (Figure 5A). Genes

were up-regulated in two predominant biological processes:
(1) altered redox levels (e.g., the glutathione synthesis genes
[gss (zgc:101574), gclc, and zgc:110010] (Additional file 1:
Table S1), and genes which encode multiple structural
components of both the catalytic (20S) and regulatory
(19S) ribosomal subunits [psmd3, psmd7, psma6b, psma5,
psmc3, psmc4, psmd11b, psmd1, psmc6, psme3, psmc1b])
[40,72-74] (Additional file 1: Table S1) and (2) 
inflammation and acute phase stress response (genes encoding 
protein serum amyloid A [zgc:103580], the pro-inflammatory
cytokine il1b, atf3, c/epb) [75,76] (Table 3, Additional file 1:
Table S1, and Figure 5B). The negative regulator atf3
dampens the inflammation response by antagonizing the
pro-inflammatory factor NF-κB, while c/ebp is robustly
up-regulated by pro-inflammatory signals, including il1b,
and functions as an enhancer of the inflammatory
response [57,75-79].
The transcription factor analysis in chromium poisoning
is consistent with the chromium-induced metabolic
depression reported in the gene ontology analysis
(Figures 4 and 5A). Chromium poisoning caused 
down-regulation of an entire set of genes encoding important
regulators of energy metabolism, glucose, cholesterol,
amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism and transport in
many tissues, including the intestine and liver, including
hnf3α, hnf3β, and hnf1β [80] (Figure 5A). hnf4α is a key
transcriptional target of both hnf3α and gata-6 [81,82]
which represents a master transcriptional activator of
energy metabolism genes in multiple tissue types [83].

and liver metabolism of nucleic acids (e.g., tcf8; Figure 5A),
carbohydrates and lipids (bmal1, ppargc1; Figure 5A), and
sterol and steroid hormones (lxr-α, coup-tfi; Figure 5A)
were also down-regulated [84-87] (Figure 5A). Genes
including g6pca, gys2, fabp1a, and abcc2 (involved in
glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and canalicular
bile acid transport, respectively) (Figure 5B and
Additional file 1: Table S1) [88]. Inflammation and acute
phase response genes were, for the most part, up-regulated
by chromium, including pro-inflammatory genes
(pcna, nfkbiaa, hamp2, ptgs2a, ptgs2b, ptges) (Figure 5B
and Additional file 1: Table S1) and genes encoding
multiple dual-specificity phosphatases which modulate
inflammatory MAPK cascades (dusp2, dusp5, dusp1)
(Figure 5B and Additional file 1: Table S1). Similar to
nickel, chromium also up-regulated il1b, c/ebp, and atf3
(Figure 5B and Additional file 1: Table S1). Chromium
also up-regulated cell cycle regulation and apoptosis genes
not enhanced in the other metals, including genes
involved in the G1/S and G2/M cell-cycle checkpoints
(ccne2, rrm2; Additional file 1: Table S1 and Figure 5B;
[89]) and in the RAD6-dependent DNA repair pathway
(pcna) [90,91] (Figure 5B). The transcription factor
p53 was also up-regulated (Figure 5A), which mediates
expression of protective genes that repair damaged
DNA, power the immune system, arrest the proliferation of
damaged cells, and induce apoptosis [92], as well as guards
the cell-cycle checkpoint by inducing apoptosis under 
conditions of excessive oxidative stress and DNA damage [93].
The transcriptomic results for chromium in particular are
consistent with the observed intestinal mucosa atrophy and
mild necrosis observed in the histopathology (Figure 2A).
Chromium is readily absorbed by the intestinal tissue. Since
gut mucosa represents the primary site for whole-body
amino acid metabolism [55,56], mucosal atrophy can
significantly diminish the gut’s amino acid metabolic
capacity and decrease amino acid requirements and
use. This hypothesis is supported by the observed
down-regulation of liver-specific genes after chromium
exposure. Robust, differential down-regulation of key
mediators of glucose metabolism (g6pca, gys2), lipid
metabolism (fabp1), and canalicular bile acid transport
(abcc2) (Figure 5B) suggest metabolic perturbations in the
liver and/or gut-liver axis [88]. Taken together, the 
biological processes, transcription factors and histopathology
data may suggest modulation of intestinal metabolic
pathways due to chromium exposure. It is unclear
whether this is a direct consequence of chromium
poisoning or a secondary consequence of 
chromium-mediated decreases in feeding over the 24 hr exposure
period. A previous study in freshwater trout exposed to
nonlethal hexavalent chromium (1/10 of the 24 hr LC50)
reported intestinal atrophy and decreased brush border
enzymatic activities consistent with decreased feeding
Page 12 of 15
behavior [94]. However, since animal care personnel
did not observe changes in feeding behavior, it is
more likely that chromium mediates specific perturbations
to the gut microenvironment that ultimately trigger
metabolic depression.
Limitations
The technical approaches used in this work have both
strengths and weaknesses. In using whole adult organism
RNA preparations, we introduce the ability to detect
toxicity responses at the whole organism level. We did
obtain gene expression level data that corroborates the
histological observations in some cases (e.g., 
chromium-induced gut histopathology), but we acknowledge that the
detection of clear organ-specific effects was not possible
with this approach because of the dilution of expression
signals for genes that have highly tissue-specific 
distributions. Highly similar gene expression profiles are
probably shared by multiple tissues, making it difficult
to differentiate among toxicity signatures for individual
target organs from the system-wide response.
Although we measured tank levels of each respective
metal, we acknowledge that this does not necessarily
indicate bioavailable dose, and that the comparison
across studies would require internal measurement of
metal concentration within the organism. The lack of a
dose-response relationship in histopathology is a significant
limitation to this study. The high doses required to observe
histopathologic changes in the acute time interval of the
study precluded identification of subtle, dose-dependent
and tissue-specific responses. It is striking that despite
establishing an exposure regimen from a 96 hr mortality
curve, there were few differences in gene responses across
the exposure levels, even though we tested gene responses
48 hr earlier than the mortality curve end points. This 
effect could be the result of selecting doses in a nearly vertical
region of the typically sigmoidal dose-response curve with
little difference between the LC20 and LC60 doses. Lower
doses or longer time intervals could better delineate the 
difference in histopathologic response in future experiments.
This observation also suggests that range-finding for
mechanistic toxicity studies such as this one should
not solely be based on mortality data. Some method of
establishing dose responsiveness based on gene expression
or other molecular endpoints are necessary as well.
Nonetheless, the present study supports the use of
transcriptomics in the intact organism to predict candidate
genes associated with toxicity endpoints in response to an
external chemical insult. Using this approach, we have
identified novel gene and transcription factor targets that
mediate the response to metal toxicity. Finally, these
new players provide hypothesis-generating targets for
future evaluation in classically designed studies of the
mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity.

Conclusion
We developed an exposure paradigm for comparing the
effects of various metals with varying toxicity mechanisms
of action using whole animal transcriptomics in the 
zebrafish vertebrate model. Using this technique, we identified
changes in expression of groups of genes consistent with
adaptive responses to toxicity induced by nickel, cobalt, or
chromium, including acute phase response, cell cycle
regulation, apoptosis, and metabolic depression, among
others. Histopathological evaluations corroborate the
toxicity endpoints derived from gene-level based pathway
analysis for chromium and cobalt.
Many of the genes enriched for biological processes’
gene responses reported in this study are consistent with
known physiological endpoints in there metals. Nickel
induces oxidative damage to DNA and proteins; genes
were up-regulated for biological processes including
protein synthesis and translation, and cell-cycle regulation
and apoptosis. Cobalt induces hypoxia; genes regulating
biological processes of redox response, protein synthesis
and translation, and inflammation and acute phase stress
response were up-regulated. Chromate is a strong
oxidizing agent and damages DNA integrity; biomolecular
pathways and genes associated with inflammation and
acute phase stress response were up-regulated and gene
signatures suggested metabolic depression occurred.
Further, a number of novel transcription factors that
mediate gene induction at the transcriptional level in
response to metal exposures were identified.
Enrichment of several functional categories of genes
plausibly involved in a variety of biological responses
was identified using unsupervised gene ontology analysis
of metal-specific gene responses. Unique histopathological
alterations were identified for each metal exposure,
consistent with metal-specific toxicity in target organs and
tissues. For nickel, we find that our toxicogenomic
approach using whole organism RNA preparations may
be more sensitive for identifying targets of nickel toxicity
than the classic toxicology approach of histopathology.
These results suggest that toxicogenomics in the whole
adult zebrafish may provide a robust model for identifying
leading indicators of toxicity and intervention approaches
for exposure to toxic chemicals.
Using a transcriptomics approach, we identify a number
of upstream modulators of metal-induced gene expression.
A number of these transcription factors have been 
previously implicated in triggering metal-specific gene responses
to toxicity (p53, Hif1a). Multiple novel mediators of the
toxic response to nickel, cobalt, or chromium in
whole adult zebrafish, including Xbp1, various Hnf
members, and Gata6 were also identified. These findings
provide additional mechanistic information on metal
toxicity mechanisms and highlight novel potential points
of intervention for treatment of metal poisoning.
