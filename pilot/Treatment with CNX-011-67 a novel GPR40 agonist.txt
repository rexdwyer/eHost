Abstract
Background: The role of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR40), which is highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells,
has been studied extensively in the amelioration of beta cell dysfunction in T2D using rat and mouse islets, beta
cell lines and in animal models of diabetes. But its potential as a therapeutic target has not been fully explored. This
aim of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CNX-011-67, a highly selective, potent and orally
bioavailable GPR40 agonist, in controlling diabetes and other metabolic parameters.
Methods: Seven week old male ZDF rats were treated with either vehicle or CNX-011-67, 5 mg/kg twice daily, for
seven weeks. The animals were subjected to oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. Plasma glucose,
insulin, triglyceride, HbA1c, fructosamine and free fatty acids were measured at selected time points. Pancreas from
control and treated animals were subjected to insulin and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1)
immunohistochemistry and were also evaluated by electron microscopy. Also the potential impact of CNX-011-67
on islet insulin secretion, content, ATP levels and markers of both glucose oxidation, beta cell health in rat islets
under chronic glucolipotoxic conditions was evaluated.
Results: Treatment of male ZDF rats with CNX-011-67 for 7 weeks significantly enhanced insulin secretion in
response to oral glucose load, delayed the onset of fasting hyperglycemia by 3 weeks, reduced nonfasting glucose
excursions, fasting free fatty acids and triglyceride levels. A significant increase in PDX1 expression and insulin
content and reduction in plasma fructosamine, HOMA-IR, and beta cell apoptosis were observed. CNX-011-67
improves glucose mediated insulin secretion, insulin gene transcription and islet insulin content in cultured rat islets
under chronic glucolipotoxic condition. Also enhanced glucose oxidation in the form of increased islet ATP content
and overall improvement in beta cell health in the form of reduced expression of stress markers (TXNIP and CHOP
mRNA) were observed.
Conclusions: These findings, suggest that long-term oral therapy with CNX-011-67 could be of clinical value to
provide good glycemic control and improve islet beta cell function.

Background
Progressive insulin resistance and loss of beta cell 
function and mass are primary characteristics of type 2
diabetes mellitus. There is thus a need for a robust 
anti-diabetic therapy that not only provides good glycemic
control but also enhances beta cell preservation and thus
delays progression of the disease. Several therapeutic 
approaches have been adopted to prevent the onset and
progression of defects in beta-cell function [1-3].
GPR40, Free Fatty Acid Receptor 1, highly expressed
in human pancreatic beta cells, brain and endocrine cells
of the gastrointestinal tract is activated by medium and
long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids [4,5].
GPR40 is coupled to Gαq/11 and specific ligands like
oleic acid induce an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] and 
consequent insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose 
concentration in a Phospholipase C (PLC) and L-type Ca2+
channel dependent manner [6]. Several small-molecule
agonists of GPR40 have been reported to enhance 
glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduce blood glucose in
mice and rodents [7-10] and also in humans [11,12].
Male ZDF rats become hyperlipidemic, 
hyperinsuline-mic and insulin resistant by 7-8 weeks of age and 
subsequently hyperglycemia sets in the presence of marked
hyperinsulinemia. As these animals are initially 
euglyce-mic they can be employed to investigate the delay in 
onset and subsequent control of progression of diabetes by
therapeutic agents [13,14].
CNX-011-67 is a highly potent and selective small 
molecule agonist with an EC50 of 0.24 nM towards human
GPR40 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The objective of the
present study was to assess the therapeutic potential of
CNX-011-67 on onset and control of hyperglycemia, as
well as on beta cell preservation in male ZDF rats.
Methods
Reagents
Glucose was estimated using Accu-check glucometer
(Roche Diagnostics, Germany), HbA1c using DCA
Vantage™ Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare, USA) and
fructosamine using a FAR kit (FAR Diagnostics, Italy).
Ultra-sensitive insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc,
USA) was used to determine plasma insulin levels. 
Circulating serum TG and plasma FFA were estimated
using TAG estimation kit (Diasys Diagnostics system,
Germany) and Randox kit (Randox Laboratories, UK) 
respectively. Triton-X and Fluromount were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animals
Six week old male ZDF rats (Charles River Indianapolis,
IN) were housed 4 per cage under a 12-h light/dark
cycle with free access to feed (rodent diet DI2450B, 
Research diets, US) and water, acclimatized for one week,
Page 2 of 13
randomized into vehicle and treatment groups and then
administered vehicle (water) or CNX-011-67 (5 mg/kg,
b.wt, dissolved in water, p.o. twice daily), respectively,
for seven weeks. The dose was selected based on a PK/
PD study in Wistar rats in which ED50 was achieved at
5 mg/kg b.wt. Body weight, and fed and fasting blood
glucose were measured at weekly intervals while feed 
intake was monitored daily and reported weekly average as
g/animal/day. All animal experiment protocols were 
approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of
Connexios Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd.
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
After 6 weeks of treatment OGTT was performed in 6 h
fasted rats by orally administering CNX-011-67 (5 mg/
kg) 30 min prior to 2 g/kg oral glucose load and blood
samples collected from the tail vein −30 min before 
molecule administration and 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 
minutes after glucose load for glucose and insulin
estimation. HOMA-beta and HOMA-IR were calculated
to assess β-cell function and insulin action respectively.
Prolonged post-prandial glucose profile
On day 42 of treatment, glucose in fed state was 
monitored at 2 h time intervals for a period of 8 h following
the OGTT.
Insulin tolerance test (ITT)
ITT was performed on day 48 in 6 h fasted rats. Blood
samples, for glucose estimation, were collected prior to
and at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min after administration
of 2 IU/kg (i.p) insulin (Humulin R Insulin, Eli Lilly).
Rat islet isolation
For in vitro experiments reported islets were isolated from
male Wistar rats (8 weeks, 180-240 gm body weight;
Charles River Lab, USA) as per previously reported [15]
and size-matched purified islets were handpicked under a
stereo-zoom microscope (Nikon, Japan).
Insulin secretion and islet insulin content measurement
Stock fatty acid solutions were prepared by conjugating
Palmitate with fatty acid free-BSA. In brief, Sodium 
palmitate was dissolved in 50% ethanol and heated at 60°C.
The 500 mM stock thus prepared was conjugated with
10% BSA by stirring for 90 min to give a solution with
a palmitate:BSA ratio of 3.6:1, filtered and used for 
experiments. Islets were cultured in growth medium (as
control) or glucolipotoxic medium (16.7 mM glucose
and 500 μM palmitate) either alone or with CNX-011-
67 for 72 h and then transferred into 24-well plates
containing 1 ml KRBH (2.5 mM glucose)/well, 
pre-incubated for 1 h and then induced with indicated 
glucose concentration alone or with 1 μM CNX-011-67
Gowda et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/28
for 2 h. Secreted insulin was measured using an ELISA
kit (Mercodia AB, Sweden) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Later, islet lysates were prepared in
lysis buffer and used for measuring intracellular islet
insulin content. Both secreted insulin and content were
expressed as amount of insulin per islet.
Measurement of ATP level
Rat islets were cultured in glucolipotoxic medium for
72 hrs, then incubated in KRBH buffer containing
2.5 mM glucose for 1 h and then induced with either
11 mM glucose (HG) alone or with 11 mM glucose and
CNX-011-67 for 1 h. Islets were then lysed and ATP
levels were estimated using ATP determination kit
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative real
time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Post 72 h of incubation, RNA was isolated, converted to
cDNA (ABI, USA) and gene expression was measured
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Eurogenetic,
Belgium). Gene primers were based on mRNA sequences
from the GenBank nucleotide database and designed 
in-house. Genes analyzed in the present study were GCK,
PDX1, Insulin, PPARa, TXNIP and CHOP. For 
quantifica-tion of gene expression, ?-actin was used as internal 
control (primer sequences are available upon request).
Pancreas histology
Pancreas was fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for
48 h and paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained with
H&E or immunofluorescence stain for microscopic
examination [16,17]. The pancreas section at the 25th,
26th, 27th , and 28th levels were taken for H&E, insulin
immunofluorescence staining, Terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase-mediated dUTP Nick end Labeling TUNEL)
[18,19] and PDX1 and insulin double 
immunofluorescence labeling, respectively.
Double immunofluorescence for insulin and PDX-1
Pancreatic sections were de-paraffinized and blocked in
1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT and incubated with a
mixture of primary antibodies against insulin (Abexome,
India) and PDX1 (Abcam USA) for 60 min at RT,
followed by washing with PBS. Sections were then 
incubated with a mixture of secondary antibody (goat 
anti-mouse FITC conjugated secondary antibody for Insulin,
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen and goat anti-rabbit 
conjugated with Alexafluor555, BioServices, India) for 30 min
at RT and mounted using fluromount. Localization and
distribution of insulin (green fluorescence) and PDX-1
(orange fluorescence) were assessed and the images were
captured at 400X magnification. The number of 
PDX1-positive nuclei was counted in all islets (12 per animal)
in the entire tissue section
mean ± SEM.
Assessment of islet apoptosis
To detect apoptosis, TUNEL staining was performed using
ApopTag Peroxidase in situ Apoptosis detection kit
(S7100) (Chemicon® International, Inc), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The entire pancreas section
was evaluated under light microscope at 400X 
magnification. Apoptosis-positive nuclei were counted within the
islets on the whole pancreatic section area [19-21].
Electron microscopy
Pancreas tissues were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde for 24 h
and processed for electron microscopy as described 
previously [17,22]. Three sections per group were scanned
and images were captured using a Transmission electron
microscope, Technai-G2 (Biotwin, FEI, Netherlands) at
magnifications of 4800X, 11000X and 23000X. All 
photographs were analyzed manually. Insulin granules were
assessed as mature granules (with an electron-dense
core, tetrahedral or hexagonal in shape, surrounded
by a peripheral halo) or as immature granules (with a
less electron-dense core and a reduced or even absent
halo) [23,24].
Assessment of insulin signaling by AKT phosphorylation
Lean control, ZDF control and ZDF rats treated with
CNX-011-67 for 7 weeks were sacrificed by cervical 
dislocation. 10 mg of tissue samples were collected from
adipose (subcutaneous), muscle (soleus) and liver from
each animal. Lysates were prepared by homogenization.
Lysates (50 μg each from liver, muscle and adipose) were
subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes and probed with primary antibody against
p-AKT and total AKT (Cell signaling, USA) and 
developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (West Pico,
Thermo Scientific, USA). The relative levels of p-AKT
compared to Total AKT were quantified using Image J
Ver. 4.2, NIH, Bethesda.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Unpaired 
Stu-dent’s t-test or with One-Way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
Post test correction, as appropriate. P value summary:
(*) <0.05, (**) <0.01 and (***) <0.001 respectively, when
compared with vehicle control.
Results
CNX-011-67 delays onset of fasting hyperglycemia in ZDF
rats
In lean control animals fasting glucose was 94 ± 4.3 mg/
dl on day 0 and was 87 ± 1.7 mg/dl by end of the 7 week
study. In the ZDF control animals fasting glucose

and values expressed as

reached 119 ± 5.14 mg/dl after 4 weeks treatment, kept
increasing and reached 204 ± 32 mg/dl at end of 7 weeks.
In contrast in the CNX-011-67 treated animals fasting
glucose was 98 ± 2.7 mg/dl at start of the study and
crossed the 100 mg/dl mark only after 6 weeks of 
treatment and reached 133 ± 12 at end of the study. 
Treatment with CNX-011-67 attenuated increase in fasting
glucose and resulted in a 3 week delay in onset of 
hyperglycemia (Figure 1A).
CNX-011-67 provides good control of hyperglycemia in
ZDF rats
In the control ZDF animals fed glucose levels increased
from 155 ± 13 mg/dl on day 0 to 403 ± 31 mg/dl at end of
7 weeks study while in the CNX- 011-67 treated animals
Page 4 of 13
the corresponding levels for the study period were 152 ±
9.6 mg/dl to 305 ± 41 mg/dl respectively (Figure 1B). In
the control ZDF animals blood glucose levels increased 
significantly upon restoration of access to food from 213 ±
23.79 mg/dl at the end of OGTT on week 6 to 414 ±
32.24 mg/dl at the end of 8 h follow up while in the 
CNX-011-67 treated animals the corresponding glucose levels
were 162 ± 13 mg/dl and 303 ± 31.92 mg/dl respectively
resulting in an 18% reduction in glucose AUC (Figure 2A).
The food intake during the 8 h follow up period was 
however not quantified in either group.
CNX-011-67 improves insulin secretion in ZDF rats
During the course of the study there was no difference
in fasting and fed insulin levels between the ZDF control
Gowda et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/28
and CNX-011-67 treated animals (Figures 1C, D). 
However in an OGTT performed on day 42 of the study the
0-30’ insulin AUC was significantly higher (p < 0.05)
(291 ± 11 vs. 249 ± 11) (Figure 2C) and the 
corresponding 0-30’ glucose AUC significantly lower (p < 0.01)
(6389 ± 207 vs. 8964 ± 576) in the CNX-011-67 treated
animals when compared to the ZDF control animals
(Figure 2D). Similarly the 0-120’ insulin AUC was
significantly higher (p < 0.05) (1093 ± 46 vs. 926 ± 52)
(Figure 2E) and the corresponding 0-120’ glucose AUC
significantly lower (p < 0.05) (29641 ± 1712 vs. 37716 ±
2767) in the CNX-011-67 treated animals (Figure 2F)
when compared to the ZDF control animals indicating
development of severe glucose intolerance in the control
ZDF animals. In treated animals the increase in insulin
levels from 6.95 ± 0.49 ng/ml at 0 min to 10.42 ±
0.47 ng/ml at 20 min and to 10.04 ± 0.42 ng/ml at
30 min post glucose load was highly significant (p < 0.01)
(Figure 2B).
The significant difference in glucose tolerance in the
OGTT observed with CNX-011-67 appears to be lost
when the AUC Glucose is calculated above the basal
values. This difference in the basal values between 
CNX-011-67 treated and control ZDF animals persists even
after the onset of feeding upon switching off of the lights
by 6 pm. Even though insulin levels at the various time
points were not measured it appears that the difference
in blood glucose levels could be due to enhanced insulin
secretion in response to incremental glucose ingestion
induced by CNX-011-67.

CNX-011-67 improves insulin signaling in peripheral
tissues and enhances glucose clearance
In ZDF control animals, an average decrease of 14, 22
and 34% in p-AKT to total-AKT levels was observed in
adipose, skeletal muscle and liver respectively when
compared to lean control group, indicating relatively
higher insulin resistance. In contrast, the tissues from
CNX-011-67 treated ZDF rats showed enhanced p-AKT
to total-AKT levels (an average of 2.7, 3.7 and 3.3 fold
increase in adipose, skeletal muscle and liver, 
respect-ively) over those from ZDF control animals (Figure 3B)
indicating an improvement in insulin signaling in the
periphery. The representative blot from one animal in
each group has been presented in Figure 3A.
In insulin tolerance test the decrease in blood glucose
levels in the CNX-011-67 treated animals, non-significant
Page 6 of 13
in the first 10 min, became significant (p < 0.05) at 20 and
30 min post insulin administration when compared with
control ZDF animals (Figure 3C). This agrees with the 
significant difference observed in HOMA-IR between ZDF
control animals (64 ± 6.17) and CNX-011-67 treated 
animals (42 ± 6) indicating a reduction in insulin resistance in
the treated animals (Table 1).
CNX-011-67 decreases serum FFA and triglyceride levels
in ZDF rats
At the end of 3rd week there was a significant (p < 0.01) 
decrease in both plasma FFAs (0.97 ± 0.05 mmol/l vs. 1.27 ±
0.02 mmol/l) and triglyceride levels (263 ± 20 mg/dl vs.
370 ± 16 mg/dl) in the CNX-011-67 treated animals when
compared to the ZDF control animals. Similar differences

Data in all panels are mean ± SEM (n = 10/group). Statistical comparison was conducted by One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test correction to arrive at the
significance level when compared with ZDF control. (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01).
were observed even at end of the study between ZDF 
control and treated animals (Figures 4A, B).
CNX-011-67 decreases HbA1c and fructosamine
After 7 weeks of treatment HbA1c level was 5.18% in
CNX-011-67 compared to 5.5% in the control ZDF
group and the difference was not statistically significant.
However plasma fructosamine levels of 111 ± 26 μmol/l
in CNX-011-67 treated animals was significantly (p <
0.01) lesser than 237 ± 17 μmol/l in the control ZDF 
animals (Table 1).
CNX-011-67 significantly improves insulin secretion in rat
pancreatic islets
Exposure of islets to chronic glucolipotoxic conditions
significantly (p < 0.05) reduced glucose stimulated insulin
secretion. However, treatment with CNX-011-67 during
exposure to glucolipotoxicity significantly (p < 0.01)
restored GSIS (Figure 5A). Similarly treatment with
CNX-011-67 significantly increased (p < 0.01) islet
insulin content when compared to that in chronic
glucolipotoxic control islets (Figure 5B).
CNX-011-67 enhances glucose metabolism and ATP
synthesis
Glucose-mediated increase in ATP levels and mRNA
expression of GCK were significantly reduced under
glucolipotoxic conditions as compared to control islets.
Chronic activation by CNX-011-67 reversed the effect of
glucolipotoxicity and significantly enhanced islet ATP
content and expression of GCK mRNA (Figures 5C, D).
CNX-011-67 enhances mRNA expression of genes
involved in insulin synthesis, and reduces expression of
genes involved in stress and apoptosis
Chronic glucolipotoxicity reduced islet mRNA 
expression of PDX1, INS1 and PPARa whereas increased
TXNIP and CHOP significantly when compared to 
control islets. Exposure of islets to CNX-011-67 under
chronic glucolipotoxic conditions, significantly restored
expression of these same genes to wild type levels
(Figures 6A, B, C, D, E).
CNX-011-67 improves PDX1 expression in islets
Beta cells in the ZDF lean controls displayed good
immuno-reactivity to PDX1 antibody and high staining
intensity. Male ZDF animals with distorted islet

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/28
architecture showed uneven immunoreactivity to PDX1
antibody and staining intensity was either low or 
completely absent. CNX-011-67 treated animals showed a
marked improvement in islet morphology and displayed
intense PDX1 immunostaining in comparison with ZDF
control animals. A reduction in PDX1-positive nuclei
number was observed in ZDF animals (461 ± 48 ZDF vs.
650 ± 49, lean control), whereas a marked improvement
was observed in CNX-011-67 treated animals (589 ± 43
vs. 461 ± 48, ZDF control) (Figures 7G, I). The values,
though not statistically significant, suggest enhanced
PDX-1 expression in CNX-011-67 treated animals.
CNX-011-67 decreases β-Cell apoptosis
Morphological features of apoptosis, including pyknotic
nuclei, were readily detectable in all pancreatic sections.
The number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic beta cells was
markedly increased in ZDF control animals compared
with lean control. There were no fragmented nuclear
apoptotic cells localized within the islets in lean control
animals. The number of TUNEL positive apoptotic cells
were significantly reduced in CNX-011-67 treated
animals (47 ± 9 vs. 29 ± 5). A reduction of ~35% in
apoptosis-positive nuclei was observed upon treatment
with CNX-011-67 (Table 1).
Electron microscopy
Islets from ZDF control animals were either without or
with a decreased number of insulin granules with
electron-dense cores with many situated away from the
plasma membrane indicating low number of docked
granules ready for release (Figure 8). These islets also
had large number of vacuoles. Islets from CNX-011-67
treated animals displayed an appreciable improvement
in number of insulin granules with electron-dense cores
surrounded by peripheral halo, tetrahedral or hexagonal
in shape well distributed within the cytoplasm and also
arrayed close to the plasma membrane indicating much
improved docking of vesicles.
CNX-011-67 improves islet insulin content and
morphology
Immunohistochemical analysis showed improvement in
insulin stained area (morphological assessment) and a
Page 8 of 13
Gowda et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/28
larger number of insulin stained cells in CNX-011-67
treated animals (694 ± 114 vs. 526 ± 26, ZDF control) 
indicating improved insulin content when compared to
control ZDF animals (Figures 7D, E, F). Islets from ZDF
lean control animals were compact and had a typical 
organized architecture while islets from control ZDF 
animals appeared enlarged and disorganized indicating loss
of architecture. H&E staining of islets from ZDF control
animals indicated a distorted architecture of islets which
was distinctly improved upon CNX-011-67 treatment
(Figures 7A, B, C). Enlarged and disorganized islets with
extensions into the surrounding exocrine tissue were 
observed in ZDF control islets and a marked improvement
was observed in animals treated with CNX-011-67 for
seven weeks.
Discussion
A significant finding of the study has been the robust
control of both the onset and progress of hyperglycemia
by CNX-011-67. Considering that fed and fasting insulin
levels did not vary between the animals in the treated
and the control groups during the study period it 
appears that the enhanced first and second phase insulin
secretion induced by the agonist (Figure 2B) is 
responsible for the robust glycemic control achieved in the
treated animals. It is well documented in literature that
an enhanced early phase insulin secretion has a direct
effect on shutting off hepatic glucose output [25,26] and
insulin is known to suppress lipolysis in adipocytes [27].
CNX-011-67 does not display any off target effect on
lipolysis in 3 T3-L1 cells (data not shown) nor does
the molecule activate PPARγ at concentrations below
10 μM. Though data on lipolysis in adipocytes derived
from control and CNX-011-67 treated animals from this
study is not available the enhanced level of p-Akt in the
adipocytes from CNX-011-67 treated animals (Figures 3A
& B) seems to indicate enhanced insulin signalling even
at the end of the study period. We therefore suggest that
the reduction in serum free fatty acids level in the
treated rats is a direct effect of the enhanced insulin
delivery and action in the adipocytes that reduces 
lipolysis. We are aware that additional studies are necessary to
establish the direct effect of CNX-011-67 mediated
increase in first phase insulin secretion in controlling
lipolysis in adipocytes. The enhanced first phase insulin
secretion (Figure 2B), reduction in free fatty acids
(Figure 4A) and the increased insulin signaling in liver
observed in CNX-011-67 treated animals (Figure 3A)
perhaps explain the significant control over fasting 
glucose achieved in the study.
Even though there was no reduction in food intake or
in body weight all through the treatment period the
significant attenuation of the increase in blood glucose
levels in the initial phase of the feeding period
(6 pm - 12 pm; Figure 2A) is indicative of reduction in
Page 9 of 13
Gowda et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2013, 14:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/14/28
peripheral insulin resistance in CNX-011-67 treated 
animals. The reduction in insulin resistance assumes 
importance as CNX-011-67 does not impact GLP1 levels
in vivo (14 ± 0.58 vs. 15.98 ± 0.32 ZDF control active
GLP1).
A reduction in circulating free fatty acid levels is
reported to impact functioning of various organs and
can thus affect multiple physiological parameters. 
Increased flux of free fatty acid into muscle reduces 
glucose uptake, into liver enhances gluconeogenesis and
into pancreas can reduce insulin secretion and increase
apoptosis [28]. The enhanced insulin secretion in 
response to glucose load (Figure 2B) and the significant
reduction in free fatty acid levels early in treatment
(Figure 4A) could have facilitated increased insulin
signaling in liver, adipose and muscle (Figure 3A)
thereby resulting in good control of fed glucose levels
(Figure 2A). It is tempting to speculate (in absence of
any supporting data) that the significant reduction in
serum triglycerides could be due to a reduction in 
lipolysis in adipocytes (and consequent reduction in flux of
free fatty acids into liver) and an improved glucose 
uptake in muscle.
In the present study it can perhaps be assumed that
the significant control on serum free fatty acids levels
achieved during the initial weeks of treatment has to a
significant extent reduced insulin resistance in the 
periphery and thus improved glycemic control. In fact there
is a significant reduction in HOMA-IR at end of the
study (Table 1) and a significant increase in insulin 
secretion in response to glucose on day 42 of treatment
when compared to control ZDF rats (Figure 2A). The 
insulin tolerance test (Figure 4) indicates overall reduction
in insulin resistance in CNX-011-67 treated rats.

Multiple genes are involved in maintaining beta cell
function. We restricted our study to a few select genes
namely PDX1, INS1, GCK, PPARα, CHOP and TXNIP
known to have significant impact on beta cell glucose
metabolism, insulin synthesis, secretion and apoptosis.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPA
Ralpha) is known to modulate insulin secretion [29] and
is reported to protect against fatty acid induced 
dysfunction by preserving carbohydrate metabolism [30] and
can also increase insulin gene transcription. TXNIP
serves as a critical link between glucose toxicity and
beta-cell apoptosis [31], mediates ER stress [32] and
glucocorticoid mediated [33] cell death and lack of
TXNIP protects against mitochondria-mediated 
apoptosis [34].
We consider the enhanced insulin-stained area in
islets to be probably due to CNX-011-67 mediated 
activation of GPR40 that can potentially stimulate ATP 
synthesis and modulate expression of genes mentioned
above under the prevailing conditions of FFAs and 
glucose levels in the animals. Data from OGTT (Figure 2B),
immunohistochemistry (Figures 7A, B, C), TUNEL assay
(Figures 7J, K, L) and the increase in number of insulin
granules with electron dense cores (Figure 8) seem to
strongly support the above assumption.
Significant differences between control ZDF and 
CNX-011-67 treated animals in fed glucose levels (255 ± 31 vs.
212 ± 35 mg/dl) developed only by week 5 and 
continued to widen till end of study (406 ± 31 vs. 305 ± 41 mg/
dl) while moderate differences in fasting glucose levels
(119 ± 5.1 vs. 94.3 ± 4 mg/dl) that developed by week 4
of treatment sharply increased by week 6 (195 ± 26 vs.
108.3 ± 3.7 mg/dl) and week 7 (204 ± 32 vs. 133 ± 12 mg/
dl). The HbA1c reduction of 0.32% reflects the control
on glucose exercised by CNX-011-67 mainly during this
period. The half-lives of glycosylated Hb being 30, 16
and 15 days in man, mouse and rat, respectively [35] the
difference in HbA1c levels of 0.32%, between control
ZDF and CNX-011-67 treated animals is achieved in a
time period that covers two half-life of rat glycosylated
Hb. The significant difference in fructosamine levels 
indicates effective control of glucose levels by CNX-011-67.
Inspite of an improvement in first phase insulin secretion
and reduction in fasting glucose levels beta cell function

as assessed by HOMA-B displayed non-significant 
improvement. It is reported that estimates of cell function
using HOMA have been shown to correlate well with 
estimates using hyperglycemic clamps and with the acute 
insulin response from the IVGTT [36]. In this study we
have not employed either hyperglycemic clamps or
performed IVGTT and hence the HOMA-B arrived at
may not reflect the actual improvement in beta cell 
function achieved in this study.
In male ZDF rats a combination of lipotoxicity and
hyperglycemia increase loss of β-cells through apoptosis
[37,38] and peripheral acting agents like Rosiglitazone,
Metformin, Troglitazone or even the DPP-IV inhibitor
FE 999011 that provided significant control over free
fatty acids, glucose and triglycerides, improved beta
cell function and delayed the progression to diabetes
[3,39,40]. Some of the pharmacological effects shown by
CNX-011-67 in the present study are similar to the
effects observed earlier in preclinical studies with other
GPR40 agonists [7,8].
Conclusions
The delay in the onset and robust control of 
hyperglycemia observed in this study appear to be mediated by
the combined effects of enhanced phasic insulin 
secretion, improvement in glucose sensitivity of beta cells, 
increased insulin content and reduction in beta cell
apoptosis. Though we have not determined the changes
in gene expression in the beta cells of treated rats in this
study the increase in expression of PDX1 protein and 
increase in insulin stained area (Figure 7) and a reduction
in beta cell apoptosis suggest that CNX-011-67 
treatment could have modulated expression of many of the
critical genes involved in insulin synthesis, insulin 
secretion and beta cell apoptosis in the male ZDF rats. From
the foregoing data it appears that CNX-011-67 has the
potential to provide good and durable glycemic control
in type 2 diabetes patients.

Figure 5 Effect of CNX-011-67 on insulin secretion, content, ATP and GCK expression. Rat islets were cultured under normal condition 
(control) or with high glucose and palmitate (glucolipotoxic condition; GL) or with CNX-011-67 under GL condition for 72 h. Post 72 h, islets was 
treated with 2 mM glucose (LG) or 11 mM glucose (HG) for 2 h and secreted insulin was measured (A). Islets were then lysed and lysate was 
used for intracellular insulin content measurement (B). Data (A) and (B) are representative of ten independent experiments (N = 10, n = 4). For ATP 
measurements, post 72 h of glucolipotoxicity in the presence or absence of CNX-011-67, islets were incubated with either 11 mM glucose (HG) 
alone or with HG + CNX-011-67 for 1 h. Islets were then lysed and ATP levels were estimated (N = 1, n = 3) (C). For GCK expression studies (D), 
RNA was isolated post 72 h of treatment and expression of GCK mRNA was measured as described under Methods (N = 2, n = 4). Statistical 
analysis was performed by Students t-test (Two-way, unpaired) or One-Way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test correction, as appropriate (*p < 0.05,
