Abstract
Inhalation of cadmium (Cd) is associated with lung diseases, but less is
known concerning pulmonary effects of Cd found in the diet. Cd has a 
dec-ades-long half-life in humans and significant bioaccumulation occurs with
chronic dietary intake. We exposed mice to low-dose CdCl2 (10 mg/L in
drinking water) for 20 weeks, which increased lung Cd to a level similar to
that of nonoccupationally exposed adult humans. Cd-treated mice had
increased airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge, and gene
expression array showed that Cd altered the abundance of 443 mRNA 
transcripts in mouse lung. In contrast to higher doses, low-dose Cd did not elicit
increased metallothionein transcripts in lung. To identify pathways most
affected by Cd, gene set enrichment of transcripts was analyzed. Results
showed that major inducible targets of low-dose Cd were neuronal receptors
represented by enriched olfactory, glutamatergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic
gene sets. Olfactory receptors regulate chemosensory function and airway
hypersensitivity, and these gene sets were the most enriched. Targeted 
metabolomics analysis showed that Cd treatment also increased metabolites in 
pathways of glutamatergic (glutamate), serotonergic (tryptophan), cholinergic
(choline), and catecholaminergic (tyrosine) receptors in the lung tissue. 
Protein abundance measurements showed that the glutamate receptor GRIN2A
was increased in mouse lung tissue. Together, these results show that in mice,
oral low-dose Cd increased lung Cd to levels comparable to humans, increased
airway hyperresponsiveness and disrupted neuronal pathways regulating 
bronchial tone. Therefore, dietary Cd may promote or worsen airway 
hyperresponsiveness in multiple lung diseases including asthma.

Low Cd Increases Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Mice
Introduction
Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic environmental metal with both
natural and anthropogenic sources (Satarug et al. 2003;
Satarug and Moore 2004). Cd has many important 
commercial uses and is also present in cigarette smoke.
Research on Cd toxicity has largely focused on 
occupational exposures and smoking, with experimental studies
using appropriate dosing and routes of exposure, showing
a broad spectrum of Cd-induced toxicities to many organ
systems, including lung (Waalkes 2003; Klaassen et al.
2009). Importantly, declines in smoking and 
environmental pollution as well as environmental remediation efforts
have considerably decreased mean population exposure to
Cd (Tellez-Plaza et al. 2012) and associated health risks
(Garcıa-Esquinas et al. 2014; Nawrot et al. 2015).
Despite success in decreasing Cd exposures, ongoing 
dispersion of Cd occurs into air, water, and soil, and remains
a significant global concern due to Cd accumulation in
foodstuffs (Satarug et al. 2003; Riederer et al. 2013). Plants
have no excretory system to eliminate Cd, so Cd in water
and soil accumulates in leafy plants and the animals that
consume them (J€arup 2003; Satarug et al. 2003). In 
individuals without occupational exposure or smoking, 
ingestion is the predominant route of Cd exposure (Parikh et al.
2014). About 10% of ingested Cd is absorbed via divalent
metal transporter-1, and higher absorption occurs in 
menstruating women due to increased activity of intestinal iron
transporters, which also transport Cd (Olsson et al. 2002).
The absorbed fraction is poorly eliminated with excretion
of only ~0.001% of body Cd per day and a half-life
>10 years (Waalkes 2003; Satarug and Moore 2004; 
Suwa-zono et al. 2009). Consequently, blood levels of Cd 
significantly increase throughout adulthood (Lee and Kim 2016).
Although total Cd exposure for US children, teens, and
adults has on average decreased, dietary Cd exposure was
unchanged over the period of the 1999-2008 NHANES
survey (Riederer et al. 2013). Estimated Cd consumption
from foodstuffs by US adults (0.30-0.35 lg/kg/day)
(Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012)
roughly equals the European Food Safety Authority
guidelines of maximal tolerable exposure (0.36 lg/kg/day)
(European Food Safety Authority, 2011) and is at least
threefold higher than the minimal risk level for chronic
oral exposure stated by the US Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry (0.1 lg/kg/day) (Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012). 
Importantly, few studies have addressed effects of low levels of
Cd exposure to determine whether these cause or
adversely contribute to common diseases.
Epidemiologic evidence shows that a lifetime of 
exposure to environmental levels of Cd is associated with the
J. D. Chandler et al.
risk of multiple organ diseases, including the lungs
(Satarug and Moore 2004; Buck Louis et al. 2012; Garcıa-
Esquinas et al. 2014), and with increased risk of adverse
effects even when adjusting for lead and mercury 
exposure (Lee and Kim 2016). Cd accumulates in the lungs of
healthy adults in proportion to environmental exposure
(Mari et al. 2014), and systemic Cd exposure is linked to
lung cancer, bronchitis, and emphysema (Waalkes 2003;
Bertin and Averbeck 2006; Hassan et al. 2014; Oh et al.
2014; Yoon et al. 2014). Furthermore, a study of 
environmental tobacco smoke in children with asthma showed
Cd-containing particulates could contribute to asthma
(Willers et al. 2005). However, the specific contribution
of dietary Cd to lung diseases is less studied.
In this study, we used a low, orally administered dose of
Cd to model dietary Cd intake. We tested whether 
low-dose Cd impacted airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in
mice and used transcriptomic analysis with gene set
enrichment to assess whether oral Cd contributes to 
pro-asthma pathways and other lung disease processes. Cd was
administered in drinking water at an amount and duration
(10 mg/L CdCl2, 20 weeks) projected to result in lung 
tissue Cd burden comparable to humans (Thijssen et al.
2007). We measured lung tissue Cd by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), airway resistance
with methacholine challenge, and transcript abundance by
gene expression array analysis with confirmation of
selected gene expression by qPCR and western blotting.
Cd increased lung tissue Cd burden, AHR and neuronal
gene sets related to olfactory, glutamatergic, cholinergic,
serotonergic, and GABAergic pathways and related 
metabolic precursors. Together, these data suggest that 
environmental Cd found in food could contribute to asthma risk.
Methods
Drinking water model of low-dose Cd
exposure in mice
All animal procedures were approved by the Atlanta
Veterans Affairs Medical Center IACUC (protocol 
number V018-03). Previous research showed that mice with
Cd in drinking water up to 100 mg/L consumed similar
amounts of food and water as control and maintain 
similar body masses (Thijssen et al. 2007). Male C57Bl6 mice
aged 8 weeks were supplied by Jackson Labs and caged in
groups of five with ad libitum food (Harlan Teklad
2018S) for 20 weeks. Water was given ad libitum with 0
or 10 mg/L (55 lmol/L) CdCl2 and fresh water was 
prepared weekly. The assayed Cd content of mouse chow
ranged from 46-87 lg/kg over the course of the study,
averaging 62  1 lg/kg. Given an estimated daily intake

of 4 g food and 6 mL water for Bl6 mice (Bachmanov
et al. 2002), water comprised 99.6% of total Cd exposure
for 10 mg/L CdCl2-exposed mice. All mice remained
healthy without weight loss or poor grooming. After
20 weeks, mice were given ketamine/xylazine, and airway
resistance was measured before a lethal dose was given for
the isolation of lung tissue.
Human lung tissue acquisition and
processing
To determine whether Cd levels attained in mouse lung
were similar to Cd in adult human lung measured using
the same methods, we obtained lung tissue from five 
individuals from the Emory Transplant Center. Sample 
collection was approved by the Emory IRB protocol
(IRB000006248). Excised tissues were stored on dry ice
before preparation in the same manner as mouse lung 
tissue for Cd measurement by ICP-MS.
Airway resistance measurements
After ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, respiratory mechanics
were measured by forced oscillation technique (Wong-
trakool et al. 2012) using the flexiVent system (SCIREQ,
Montreal, Canada) with tracheotomized mice (n = 8). 
Tracheas were aseptically isolated and cannulated. Mechanical
ventilation (150 breaths/min, tidal volume 8 mL/kg, PEEP
2.5 cm H2O) was initiated after calibration. After baseline
measurements were obtained, increasing doses of inhaled
methacholine were administered in 5-min intervals. Three
consecutive peak values for airway resistance at each
methacholine dose were selected for analysis. Coefficients
of determination were >0.95 for all values analyzed.
Inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS)
Mouse (n = 8) or human (n = 4) lung tissue was 
homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer followed by brief 
son-ication on ice. Samples consisting of 1.5 mg protein from
mouse or human lung tissue were treated with nitric acid
for digestion of organic material prior to measurement by
ICP-MS. ICP-MS procedures conformed to previously
stated accuracy (100  10%) and precision standards
(relative standard deviation < 12%). Lung tissue Cd is
reported as ng per mg lung tissue protein.
Transcriptomics
RNA was isolated from mouse lung tissue lysate (n = 3)
with the mirVana Total RNA Isolation Kit (Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, California). RNA was hybridized on

Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 2.0 exon chips following
NuGEN Ovation amplification. CEL files were converted
to Robust Multi-Array (RMA) data with R package
“oligo” (Bioconductor); then, differential expression of
genes was analyzed with R package “limma” (Bioconduc-
tor). CEL files and RMA data are accessible at the Gene
Expression Omnibus hosted by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (accession: GSE74256). 
Transcripts were annotated according to the Affymetrix na33.2
annotation release. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis applet
(GSEA; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) (Subramanian
et al. 2005) was used to determine the enriched gene sets
from canonical pathways. Gene sets significant at 
FDR-adjusted q < 0.05 and containing at least one differentially
expressed gene in the leading edge were then analyzed.
Quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction RT-qPCR
Primers were designed using the NCBI Primer-Blast tool,
with exon-exon junctions included when possible. cDNA
was prepared from aliquots of the same mouse lung tissue
RNA used for Affymetrix array using the Advantage 
RT-for-PCR Kit (ClonTech, Mountain View, California) and
diluted 25-fold in molecular biology grade water. A 
quantity of 4 lL was then mixed with 16 lL 1.25X iScript SYBR
Green reaction master mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
400 nmol/L forward and reverse primers. PCR was run for
40 cycles consisting of 20 sec each at 94°C, 56°C, and
72°C. Melt curves and gel electrophoresis were used to 
confirm uniform product at the expected size. A logarithmic
standard curve was run with each gene to calibrate PCR
reaction efficiency. Primer designs are given in Table 1.
Western blotting
A quantity of 20 lg of protein extracted from mouse lung
tissue (n = 4) was loaded and run on SDS-PAGE gels,
electroblotted onto PVDF, and probed with antibodies
specific to GRIN2A (ab124913), olfactory marker protein
(ab87338), or GAPDH (ab181602) (Abcam, Cambridge,
Massachusetts). Bands were visualized using an Odyssey
scanner (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) and intensity was
quantified by NIH ImageJ software.
Targeted analysis of neurotransmitter
metabolites
Aliquots (250 lg protein) of mouse lung homogenate
(n = 8) were diluted in 70 lL HPLC-grade water and
extracted with 140 lL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile 
containing a mixture of stable isotopic standards including
[15N]-choline, [13C5]-glutamate, and [15N]-tyrosine (Go

et al. 2013, 2014b). Samples were incubated at 4°C for
30 min and supernatant isolated by centrifugation at
16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Metabolites were analyzed in
triplicate using a high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)
platform with C18 liquid chromatography and positive
electrospray ionization on a High Field QExactive MS
(Thermo, Waltham, Massachusetts) set to a scan range of
85-1275 m/z (Soltow et al. 2013). Chemical features were
extracted using xMSanalyzer (Uppal et al. 2013) with
apLCMS (Yu et al. 2009). Identities and lmol/L 
abundances were established by MS/MS and coelution with
authentic heavy-isotope labeled standards and/or by 
comparison to reference standards (Go et al. 2015a).
Statistics
Student’s t-test was used to compare Cd-treated mice 
versus control for mean Cd content by ICP-MS, gene 
expression, and target metabolites. Two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to test the effect of Cd on AHR with
increasing methacholine dose. One-way ANOVA with
Holm-Sidak posttest was used to test Cd content of lung
tissue and Cd effect on airway hyperresponsiveness.
Limma (Diboun et al. 2006) was used to evaluate gene
significance from the Affymetrix RMA data matrix. Gene
set significance was determined within the GSEA applet.
Results
Accumulation of Cd in mouse lung by

higher in mice treated with Cd compared with the control
mice (Cd-treated: 0.58  0.06 ng Cd/mg protein, control:
0.14  0.05 ng Cd/mg protein, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1).
A small number of human lung samples (n = 5) were 
analyzed with the same methods. The results (0.54  0.20 ng
Cd/mg protein; Fig. 1) showed that human tissue had a
similar mean value to that of the mouse model, consistent
with prior data (Mari et al. 2014). Taken together, these
results show that low-dose Cd in drinking water for
20 weeks increased Cd in mouse lung tissue to levels
comparable to human lungs.

Low-dose oral Cd increased mouse airway
resistance
To examine whether oral Cd exposure affected bronchial
reactivity, airway resistance was assessed by the forced
oscillation technique using a constant phase model
(Wongtrakool et al. 2012). Mice exposed to Cd had
increased airway resistance following methacholine 
challenge compared to unexposed control animals, maximally
at 50 mg/mL of methacholine (Cd: 4.93  0.65 cm
H2O sec/mL, control: 3.25  0.39; two-way ANOVA
P < 0.05 for Cd factor; Fig. 2). The total area under the
curve of airway resistance in the Cd-treated mice was
35% greater than control. These data show increased 
airway hyperresponsiveness as a result of low-dose oral Cd
exposure.
Low Cd Increases Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Mice
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to test for significant 
over-or underrepresentation of gene sets based on transcript
abundance. Gene sets significantly overrepresented (FDR
q < 0.05) following Cd exposure were predominantly
neuronal in nature (Fig. 3). Olfactory receptor (Olfr) gene
sets were most significant, including 20 differentially
expressed transcripts of Olfr genes and olfactory marker
protein (Omp) gene. Furthermore, glutamatergic, 
cholinergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic gene sets were also
enriched. Differentially expressed genes within these sets
included glutamatergic receptors (Grin2a), cholinergic
receptors (Chrna2), serotonergic receptors (Htr3b), and
GABAergic receptors (Gabrb3) (Table 1). Pou5f1, a gene
implicated in promoter control of mouse olfactory 
receptor expression (Plessy et al. 2012), was also increased by
Cd.
Low-dose Cd increased gene enrichment
associated with neuronal pathways
To determine whether low-dose oral Cd exposure affected
mouse lung gene expression, mRNA was isolated and
analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays. Four hundred and
forty-three genes were differentially expressed at P < 0.05
between Cd-treated and control groups. To test for 
pathway enrichment among these genes, we used Gene Set

Molecular confirmation of neuronal targets
of low-dose Cd
To confirm microarray results of neuronal pathway
enrichment, mRNA-targeting primers were designed
(Table 2) and transcript abundance was quantified by
RT-qPCR (Fig. 4). Among the genes tested, Grin2a had
the largest fold increase (Fig. 4; 11.3-fold of control;
P < 0.05); genes in olfactory and serotonergic pathways
were also significant, while others trended to increase by
Cd. We also examined the abundance of the GRIN2A
protein as the mRNA most increased by Cd in the qPCR
panel and confirmed the protein level increase (Fig. 5;
5.9-fold of control, P < 0.05). The quality of images for
olfactory receptor protein was insufficient to determine
whether this protein was increased.
Non-neuronal effects of low-dose Cd
Non-neuronal gene sets of defensins and steroid hormone
synthesis were also enriched following low-dose Cd 
treatment (Fig. 3A gene sets 6, 7, and 17), but none of the
top genes enriching these sets were significantly different,
so they were not targeted for confirmation. Additionally,
many gene sets were enriched due to underrepresentation
of gene transcripts, rather than by overrepresentation.
These negatively enriched gene sets included cell cycle 
disruption, 26S proteasomal dysfunction, and cytoskeletal
remodeling, consistent with Cd effects on carcinogenesis
(Go et al. 2014a, 2015b).
Gene set enrichment analysis showed no significant
enrichment of increased or decreased transcripts 
associated with metal response pathways. Because 
metallothionein (MT) is induced in lung tissue following acute Cd
inhalation (Klaassen et al. 2009), we targeted these 
transcripts for confirmation. Low-dose oral Cd did not alter

factors (data not shown). Cd significantly decreased Mt2 by
microarray analysis (P < 0.05); qPCR showed a 3.4-fold
decrease, but this was not significant (P = 0.15).
Cd altered the abundance of
neurotransmitter metabolic precursors in
mouse lung tissue
To test for changes in neurotransmitter and precursor
metabolite abundances, we performed metabolomics
analysis on mouse lung tissue using high-resolution mass
spectrometry (Soltow et al. 2013). Multiple amino acid
and amines in neuronal pathways, predominantly 
neuron-transmitter precursors, were significantly increased by Cd
(Fig. 6). These included glutamate (a co-agonist for
NDMA receptors such as GRIN2A, and a precursor of
GABA), choline (an acetylcholine precursor), tryptophan
(a serotonin precursor), and tyrosine (a catecholamine
precursor). Furthermore, glutamate was >10-fold more
abundant than tryptophan (Fig. 6A vs. 6C), which 
accurately reflects the relative abundances of amino acids in

Discussion
Circulating Cd is predictive of airway obstruction and loss
of lung function in healthy adults (Oh et al. 2014; Yoon
et al. 2014) suggesting that once absorbed, Cd is a strong
determinant of lung disease. This study shows that 
low-dose Cd in drinking water increased mouse lung Cd to
levels found in human lung (Fig. 1) and also increased
AHR in the mouse model (Fig. 2). AHR (sometimes
B kDaGRIN2A
2016 | Vol. 4 | Iss. 13 | e12821
Page 7
Low Cd Increases Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Mice
called bronchial hyperresponsiveness) is a hallmark of
asthma and may also occur in COPD (Borak and 
Lefkow-itz 2016). Clinical distinctions between the major 
AHR-presenting diseases, asthma and COPD, become less clear
as patients age (Slats and Taube 2016); because Cd 
accumulates over the human lifespan (Lee and Kim 2016), the
present results suggest that dietary Cd could be generally
important as a comorbidity factor in age-associated 
AHR-presenting disease.
Although the possible role, extent, and mechanism(s)
of Cd in these processes are uncertain, clinical data 
support the potential for dietary Cd as a lung disease risk
factor. Blood Cd is associated with metabolic syndrome
(Lee and Kim 2016), which may cause or contribute to
asthma symptoms (Serafino-Agrusa et al. 2015). Urinary
Cd measured in asthmatic children (median, 0.33 lg/L)
(Willers et al. 2005) is increased compared to that of
NHANES children data collected the same year (mean,
0.08 lg/L) (Riederer et al. 2013). Chronic respiratory
symptoms are associated with urinary Cd in elderly 
individuals (Garcıa-Esquinas et al. 2015), and asthma, 
bronchitis, and emphysema are associated with old housing
which is a significant predictor of blood and urinary Cd

(Shiue and Bramley 2015). However, heavy metals in
urine including Cd were not associated with adult asthma
in 2007-2008 NHANES data (Mendy et al. 2012) and 
urinary Cd was not a determinant of pro-asthmatic 
respiratory symptoms in a cohort of Hong Kong preschoolers
(Leung et al. 2013).
In this study, low-dose Cd increased neuronal receptor
transcripts and metabolites suggesting contribution to
lung pathophysiology, including olfactory receptors, 
glutamatergic receptors, glutamate, and precursor metabolites
from GABAergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic pathways
(Figs. 4-6; schematic summary in Fig. 7). Protein level
for the glutamate-receptor GRIN2A was also increased.
Similar changes have previously been noted in control of
airway resistance. Airway glutamatergic signaling was
shown to control contractility in human airway smooth
muscle cells and murine thin-cut lung slices (Anaparti
et al. 2015), and pulmonary neuroendocrine signaling by
olfactory and serotonergic receptors was observed to 
regulate bronchial tone (Gu et al. 2014). Although the present
design did not include Cd dose-response, we examined
lung tissue transcript data from another study (JD 
Chandler, ML Orr, L Hao, DP Jones, and Y-M Go,

unpublished) with mice given 3.3 mg CdCl2 per liter of
drinking water for 16 weeks. These results showed that
olfactory signaling and glutamatergic pathways were
among the top 20% of overrepresented gene sets. 
Therefore, the results are consistent with a role for Cd-depen-
dent induction of genes in neuronal pathways, increased
GRIN2A protein, and elevation of metabolites associated
with these neuronal pathways, in the mechanisms of
AHR.
Asthma is epidemiologically linked with neurological
disorders by hormonal and monoaminergic signaling 
disruption (Van Lieshout et al. 2009). Furthermore, 
olfactory, glutamatergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems
may be overactive in asthma patients and others with
AHR (Xiang et al. 2007; Gu et al. 2014; Anaparti et al.

Olfactory receptors, which comprised the most overrepresented
gene sets (Fig. 3), are expressed by sparsely populated
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and control airway 
sensitivity to volatile compounds via serotonergic and 
neu-ropeptide pathways (Gu et al. 2014). Pulmonary
autonomic functions such as serotonergic signaling have
previously been implicated in the control of asthma,
cough, bronchitis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension
(Bayer et al. 2007; Dempsie and MacLean 2008; Wang
et al. 2014). Lung olfaction results in the release of
metabolites to increase airway smooth muscle contractility
(Dupont et al. 1999; Cazzola and Matera 2000; Gu et al.
2014).
Cd may also contribute to asthma symptoms by 
interacting with other factors that regulate lung disease. Iron
sufficiency is a strong negative determinant of Cd burden
(Olsson et al. 2002), and iron in exhaled breath is
decreased in asthma (Mutti et al. 2006). Zinc is protective
against Cd by the induction of metallothionein and other
unspecified mechanisms (Mishima et al. 1997), and zinc
can improve clinical symptoms of asthma in children
such as cough, wheezing, and pulmonary function (Ghaf-
fari et al. 2014). Selenium is decreased in the plasma of
asthmatics (Fabian et al. 2013) and is a selective ionic
binding partner of Cd in mammals that may help to
sequester or remove Cd from the body (Arai et al. 2004).
Finally, both zinc and selenium restore anti-nitrergic
effects of Cd in mice (G€ocmen et al. 2000). Thus, Cd,
iron, zinc, and selenium may coordinately regulate the
potential contribution of Cd to AHR by direct interaction
(Cd-selenium), competition for transporters (Cd-iron),
or regulation of protective factors (Cd-zinc).
Many of the transcripts detected here also play roles in
lung carcinogenesis. Transformed lung cells often express
increased and/or polymorphic neuroendocrine receptors,
including olfactory receptors (Giandomenico et al. 2013;
€Oberg 2015), glutamate receptors (Okayama et al. 2012;
Ahn et al. 2014), and cholinergic receptors (Robles et al.
2014). Indeed, GRIN2A is increased in some lung 
adeno-carcinomas (Okayama et al. 2012; Xin et al. 2013). Thus,
while the present results demonstrate an important new
pathway of AHR by dietary Cd, they also are consistent
with the known lung carcinogenesis potential of Cd
(Waalkes 2003).
Increased MT gene expression and protein abundance
is a well-characterized cellular response to Cd, particularly
in the kidney and liver (Klaassen et al. 2009). In this
study, however, Cd decreased Mt2, and other MT genes
were not affected. This is in contrast to increased MT
expression in response to acutely inhaled Cd (Hart et al.
1989; Klaassen et al. 2009). The implications of this lack

Low Cd Increases Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Mice
of response concerning human respiratory health effects
of Cd at a dose mimicking that in foodstuffs are not
clear; in the worst case, the results suggest that lung may
be relatively unprotected against low-dose, chronic Cd
exposure.
In conclusion, low-dose oral Cd in mice caused lung
Cd burden similar to that in adult humans, increased 
airway hyperresponsiveness, increased abundance of 
transcripts of genes controlling autonomic and chemosensory
pathways, increased glutamate and other metabolites 
associated with these pathways, and increased 
glutamate-receptor GRIN2A protein. The results suggest a new
mechanism for clinical observations that Cd is associated
with AHR-associated lung diseases (Willers et al. 2005;
Oh et al. 2014; Yoon et al. 2014). Given the population
burden of asthma and COPD, the results emphasize an
ongoing need to improve understanding of the 
mechanisms of low-dose Cd toxicity, dietary sources of Cd, and
possible public health impact of dietary Cd in
airway
hyperresponsiveness and lung disease.

Figure 5. Western blotting of GRIN2A. Mouse lung tissue proteins 
were denatured, reduced with DTT, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 
7.5% gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes which 
were immunoblotted for GRIN2A (165 kDa) and GAPDH (37 kDa). 
Expression of GRIN2A was then normalized to GAPDH. (A) Relative 
quantification of lung tissue GRIN2A. (B) Membrane images of

Figure 4. RT-qPCR confirmation of neuronal genes increased by 
low-dose oral Cd. The abundances of target neuronal genes were 
examined by RT-qPCR to confirm microarray and gene set 
enrichment results (ordered by fold change). Primer designs are 
given in Table 1. Abundances were normalized to RPS18 using the 
2DDCT method. n = 3. *P < 0.05.

Figure 6. Mouse lung metabolites associated with neuronal pathways are increased by low-dose oral Cd. Lung tissue samples were extracted 
using acetonitrile and analyzed by high-resolution LC-MS with targeted data processing for neuronal metabolites. Biological reference standards 
containing known concentrations of metabolites were used to estimate quantities of (A) glutamate, (B) choline, (C) tryptophan, and (D) 
tyrosine. n = 8. *P < 0.05.

Figure 7. Low-dose oral Cd increases airway hyperresponsiveness 
mediated by neuronal pathways. Orally absorbed Cd is transported 
into lung tissue and increases airway resistance by disrupting 
autonomic receptors and neuronal pathways. Increased NMDA 
receptor, ionotropic 2A (GRIN2A) protein expression, by way of 
increased Grin2a mRNA, and increased glutamate abundance 
coordinately contribute to increased glutamatergic activity that may 
drive increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in turn. Cd also 
increases metabolites and messenger RNA in other neuronal 
pathways (olfactory, serotonergic, cholinergic) which may also 
contribute to AHR. Therefore, orally absorbed Cd may increase AHR 
at the gene, protein, and metabolite levels, and this may contribute 
to worse symptoms in asthma, COPD, and other lung diseases.
