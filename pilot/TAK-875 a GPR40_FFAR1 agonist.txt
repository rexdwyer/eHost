BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
TAK-875, a selective GPCR40/free fatty acid receptor 1 agonist, improves glycaemic control by increasing glucose-dependent
insulin secretion. Metformin is a first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes that improves peripheral insulin resistance.
Based on complementary mechanism of action, combining these agents is expected to enhance glycaemic control. Here, we
evaluated the chronic effects of TAK-875 monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin in diabetic rats.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Long-term effects on glycaemic control and β-cell function were evaluated using Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, which
develop diabetes with hyperlipidaemia and progressive β-cell dysfunction.
KEY RESULTS
Single doses of TAK-875 (3-10 mg·kg−1) and metformin (50-150 mg·kg−1) significantly improved both postprandial and
fasting hyperglycaemia, and additive improvements were observed in their combination. Six-week treatment with TAK-875
(10 mg·kg−1, b.i.d.) significantly decreased glycosylated Hb (GHb) by 1.7%, and the effect was additively enhanced by
combination with metformin (50 mg·kg−1, q.d.; GHb: −2.4%). This improvement in glycaemic control in the combination
group was accompanied by significant 3.2-fold increase in fasting plasma insulin levels. Pancreatic insulin content was
maintained at a level comparable to that in normal rats by combination treatment (vehicle: 26, combination: 67.1; normal
lean: 69.1 ng·mg−1 pancreas) without affecting pancreatic glucagon content. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed normal
morphology, enhanced pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 expression and increased PCNA-positive cells in islets of the
combination group.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Our results indicate that combination therapy with TAK-875 and metformin could be a valuable strategy for glycaemic control
and β-cell preservation in type 2 diabetes.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated plasma
glucose levels arising from increased peripheral insulin
resistance and the gradual loss of β-cell function (Kahn,
2000). As chronic hyperglycaemia contributes to the 
complications associated with type 2 diabetes (Giorgino et al.,
2005), the primary goal for treatment is to maintain 
normo-glycaemia with fewer adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia.
Based on the algorithm for medical management of type
2 diabetes, metformin, a biguanide derivative, is 
recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy (Inzucchi
et al., 2012). Metformin provides glucose-lowering effects
via pleiotropic action including decreased hepatic glucose
production, increased peripheral glucose disposal and
reduced intestinal glucose absorption (Hundal and Inzucchi,
2003). To achieve adequate glycaemic control, combination
therapy with multiple drugs that have different mechanisms
of action than metformin is often required. However, despite
the availability of numerous anti-diabetic agents, many
patients have not yet achieved adequate glycaemic control
(U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1995). Therefore,
there remains a need for agents that have improved
efficacy and/or a lower risk of adverse effects and can be
used in combination treatment, especially with metformin
(Charpentier, 2002).
GPCR40 (GPR40)/free fatty acid receptor 1 is a GPCR
highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells (Briscoe et al., 2003;
Itoh et al., 2003). Long- and medium-chain free fatty acids
(FFAs) are endogenous ligands for GPR40, and the activation
of GPR40 by FFAs leads to glucose-dependent augmentation
of insulin secretion through activation of the Gαq-pathway
(Fujiwara et al., 2005; Shapiro et al., 2005), which is a distinct
mechanism from other oral insulinotropic drugs, such as
sulfonylureas (SU; Rendell, 2004) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitors (Pratley, 2009). Nagasumi et al. (2009)
have previously reported that mice overexpressing human
GPR40 in pancreatic β-cells exhibit improved glucose 
excursion and increased insulin secretion during an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT). This finding suggests that GPR40 could
be an attractive drug target to enhance insulin secretion in
type 2 diabetes.
TAK-875 is a potent, selective and orally available GPR40
agonist that enhances insulin secretion in a glucose
concentration-dependent manner (Negoro et al., 2010; 2012;
Tsujihata et al., 2011). Oral administration of TAK-875 
markedly improves postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats,
while TAK-875 does not affect normoglycaemia even at a dose
higher than the effective dose in fasted normal rats (Tsujihata
et al., 2011). In addition, it was demonstrated that TAK-875
significantly improved glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic
patients with minimum risk of hypoglycaemia compared
with SUs (Araki et al., 2012; Burant et al., 2012).
FFAs acutely stimulate insulin secretion, while chronic
exposure to FFAs causes β-cell dysfunction and death,
so-called lipotoxicity. Because endogenous ligands of GPR40
are medium- and long-chain FFAs, there remained concern
regarding the involvement of GPR40 in lipotoxicity
(Steneberg et al., 2005). We have previously shown that
chronic exposure to TAK-875 does not cause β-cell 
dysfunction in rat insulinoma cells, in contrast to FFAs (Tsujihata
of GPR40 agonist and metformin BJPCombination
et al., 2011). However, there are no published reports 
examining in detail the effects on β-cell function after long-term
activation of GPR40 in vivo. Because such analyses in clinical
trials are difficult, animal studies are essential for the 
development of novel anti-diabetic drugs.
Because of the complementary mechanisms of action
between GPR40 agonists and metformin, combination
therapy with these agents is expected to provide favourable
effects on glycaemic control. Recently, combination 
treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin in a diabetic rat
model and drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes has been
shown to improve glycaemic control and β-cell function
(Han et al., 2011; Williams-Herman et al., 2012). However,
the effects of combination treatment with a GPR40 agonist
and metformin on development of diabetes and on β-cell
dysfunction remain poorly understood.
In the present study, we evaluated the chronic effects
of TAK-875 in combination with metformin on glycaemic
control in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. The ZDF rat is a
severe type 2 diabetic model, which exhibits hyperglycaemia,
hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance. The islets of these rats
show disruption of normal islet architecture, β-cell 
degranu-lation and increased β-cell death (Lee et al., 1994; Finegood
et al., 2001). It has been reported that plasma FFA and 
triglyceride (TG) content of islets begins to rise progressively prior to
the onset of hyperglycaemia (Lee et al., 1994), suggesting the
involvement of lipotoxicity in β-cell dysfunction in this
model. Therefore, this model is also suitable for evaluating
the chronic effects of TAK-875 on β-cell function. In addition,
our study was designed to evaluate the chronic effects of
combination treatment with TAK-875 and metformin on
plasma hormone profiles, pancreatic hormone content and
β-cell morphology in these rats.
Methods
Animals
Male ZDF (leprfa/CrlCrlj fatty fa/fa) rats and non-diabetic
littermates, male Zucker lean (ZL; leprfa/CrlCrlj lean +/+ or
fa/+) rats, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories
Japan, Inc. (Yokohama, Japan). All rats were housed in 
individual metal cages in a room with controlled temperature
(23°C), humidity (55%) and lighting, and were allowed free
access to powdered standard laboratory chow diet (CE-2,
Clea, Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and tap water, unless 
otherwise indicated. Rats were group housed in single dosing
study, while they were single housed in multiple dosing study
due to precise measurement of each food intake. All studies
involving animals are reported in accordance with the
ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al.,
2010). The care and use of the animals and experimental
protocols used in this study were approved by the 
Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of Takeda 
Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Kanagawa, Japan).

and metformin were suspended in 0.5%methylcellulose 
solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Limited).
OGTT
At the age of 8 weeks, ZDF and ZL rats were fasted overnight.
ZDF rats were divided into four groups (n = 6) so that each
mean of plasma glucose, TG and body weight had no 
statistically significant differences among groups. Each group of
ZDF rats was orally given vehicle, TAK-875 (3 mg·kg−1), 
metformin (50 mg·kg−1) or TAK-875 (3 mg·kg−1) in combination
with metformin (50 mg·kg−1). ZL rats (n = 5) were orally given
vehicle. Plasma parameters measured for the grouping of the
animals were used as baseline (pre) data. Sixty minutes after
drug administration, all animals received an oral glucose load
(1 g·kg−1). Blood samples were collected from the tail vein just
before glucose load (time 0), and 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after
glucose load for determination of plasma glucose and insulin
levels.
Single dosing study in the fasted state
At the age of 19 weeks, non-fasted ZDF rats were divided
into four groups (n = 6) so that each mean of glycosylated
Hb (GHb), plasma glucose, TG and body weight had no
statistically significant differences among groups. Rats were
fasted overnight, and each group was orally given vehicle,
TAK-875 (10 mg·kg−1), metformin (150 mg·kg−1) or TAK-875
(10 mg·kg−1) in combination with metformin (150 mg·kg−1).
Plasma glucose and insulin levels were determined using
blood samples collected from the tail vein at time 0 and 0.5,
1, 2, 4 and 6 h after dosing.
Multiple dosing study
ZDF and ZL rats were fed powder normal chow twice a day in
the morning and evening (2 h each) for 5 days. At the age of
10 weeks, ZDF rats were divided into four groups (n = 6) so
that each mean of GHb, plasma glucose, TG, insulin and
body weight had no statistically significant differences
among groups. The diet was switched to a high-calorie diet
(Quick Fat, Clea, Japan Inc.) under the same time-restricted
feeding conditions, and each group was orally given vehicle,
TAK-875 (10 mg·kg−1, b.i.d.), metformin (50 mg·kg−1, q.d. in
the evening) or TAK-875 (10 mg·kg−1, b.i.d.) in combination
with metformin (50 mg·kg−1, q.d. in the evening) 30 min
prior to feeding. Five ZL rats were treated with vehicle as a
healthy control. After 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment, blood
samples were collected from the tail vein before feeding in
the morning, and GHb, plasma glucose, TG, total cholesterol
(TC), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin and glucagon
were measured. Body weight and food intake were measured
once weekly. After 44 days of treatment, all rats were killed,
and a portion of the pancreas was cut into two pieces. One
piece was used for determination of pancreatic hormone
content, and the other was placed in Bouin’s fixative solution
(Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) for 
immunohisto-chemical analysis.

Measurements of plasma and
pancreatic parameters
Plasma glucose, TG, TC and NEFA were enzymatically 
measured with an Autoanalyzer 7080 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). GHb
was measured by an HPLC-based automated Analyzer 
HLC-723 G7 (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma insulin and glucagon
were measured using a RIA kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
A piece of pancreas was homogenized in acid-ethanol (74%
ethanol containing 0.15 mol·L−1 HCl), and centrifuged. The
insulin and glucagon levels in the supernatant were measured
using an RIA kit (Millipore, for insulin and TFB, Tokyo, Japan
for glucagon).
Immunohistochemical analysis
After overnight fixation, four pancreata from each group
were embedded in paraffin. The deparaffinized sections
were exposed to primary antibodies, guinea pig anti-insulin
antibody (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), rabbit 
anti-glucagon antibody (DAKO), rabbit anti-pancreas duodenum
homeobox-1 [PDX-1, a key transcriptional factor of β-cell
function (Melloul, 2004) ] polyclonal antibody (TransGenic,
Kumamoto, Japan) or mouse anti-PCNA, a marker of cell
proliferation (Rafacho et al., 2008) monoclonal antibody
(DAKO) overnight at 4°C. After detection of bound antibody
using a polymer-labelled Envision+ system (DAKO), the 
sections were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine 
tetrahy-drochloride substrate and counterstained with haematoxylin.
Digital images were obtained with an inverted microscope
IX71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), or with an Aperio ScanScope
XT system (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
The homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function
(HOMA-β) index was calculated using the following formula:
[fasting insulin (μU·mL−1) × 360] / [fasting glucose (mg·dL−1) -
63] (Matthews et al., 1985). Statistical differences compared
with vehicle were analysed with Dunnett’s test or Steel’s test.
Statistical differences between ZDF rats and ZL rats were 
analysed with Student’s t-test or the Aspin-Welch test. To 
evaluate if combination treatment had significant additive or
synergistic effects, two-way
et al., 2009). The results were interpreted as follow (i) When a
significant interaction effect (P ≤ 0.05) was observed, the
effect of combination was synergistic (when the effect of the
combination treatment exceeds the sum of the effect of
the monotreatment); and (ii) When no significant interaction
and significant main effects of both drugs (P ≤ 0.05) were
observed, the effect was additive (when the effects of the
combination treatment equals the sum of the effect of the
monotreatment). All data were presented as mean ± SD.
Results
Acute administration of TAK-875 and
metformin in combination additively
improves postprandial and fasting
hyperglycaemia
Before multiple dosing studies, we examined the
effects of TAK-875, metformin and their combination on
ANOVA was performed (Moritoh
acute
postprandial hyperglycaemia during OGTT in young ZDF
rats (8 weeks of age). TAK-875 exhibits high oral 
bioavail-ability (76%), Cmax of 5.8 μg mL−1, Tmax of 1 h following a
3 mg kg−1 oral dosing in fasted rats (Negoro et al., 2010). In
this study, 3-10 mg·kg−1 of TAK-875 was selected based on
the pharmacokinetic profiles: this dose is similar to clinical
doses of TAK-875 (Naik et al., 2012). Oral administration of
TAK-875 (3 mg·kg−1), metformin (50 mg·kg−1), and their
combination 1 h before glucose load significantly decreased
plasma glucose AUC by 21.0, 15.4 and 33.8%, respectively,
compared with vehicle, and the glucose tolerance in the
combination group was even better than that in normal ZL
rats (Figure 1A, C). Two-way ANOVA showed additive 
glucose-lowering effects in the combination (TAK-875, P ≤ 0.01;
metformin, P ≤ 0.01; interaction, not significant). TAK-875
significantly enhanced insulin secretion before a glucose
load (P ≤ 0.01) and tended to augment it at 10 min after
of GPR40 agonist and metformin BJPCombination
glucose load, while metformin showed a trend towards
reduce insulin release at 10 min (Figure 1B, D). TAK-875 and
metformin in combination also increased insulin secretion
just before glucose challenge compared with vehicle,
although the increase was not statistically significant
(P = 0.059; Figure 1B, D).
Next, effects of these drugs on fasting hyperglycaemia
were evaluated in aged ZDF rats. Fasting plasma glucose levels
were significantly elevated in 19-week-old ZDF rats compared
with age-matched normal rats (13.0 ± 3.0 mmol·L−1 vs.
5.6 ± 0.2 mmol·L−1, P ≤ 0.01). Acute dosing of TAK-875
(10 mg·kg−1) significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose
levels with augmentation of insulin secretion in ZDF rats
(Figure 2). Metformin (150 mg·kg−1) also improved fasting
hyperglycaemia without changes in insulin release (Figure 2).
The combination treatment with TAK-875 and metformin
additively decreased fasting plasma glucose levels (TAK-875,
British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 170 568-580 571
P ≤ 0.01; metformin, P ≤ 0.01; interaction, not significant),
and significantly increased fasting plasma insulin levels 
compared with vehicle (Figure 2). The amount of the secreted
insulin was almost the same as that seen with TAK-875 
treatment (Figure 2B, D). These results indicate that combination
treatment with TAK-875 and metformin effectively improves
postprandial and fasting hyperglycaemia while sparing
insulin secretion, compared with each drug alone.
Multiple dosing of TAK-875 slows
progression of diabetes, and the effect is
additively potentiated by the combination
with metformin
To expand the results mentioned earlier after acute dosing
to the chronic setting, the effects of multiple dosing of 
TAK-875 on glycaemic control were examined in ZDF rats. To
accurately confirm the effects of insulinotropic drugs taken
before meals, rats were subjected to time-restricted feeding,
in which a high-calorie diet was fed twice daily for 2 h per
feeding. TAK-875 (10 mg·kg−1) or metformin (50 mg·kg−1)
572 British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 170 568-580
was administered 30 min before meal twice daily or once
daily in the evening respectively. After 6 weeks of 
treatment, no significant changes in body weight and 
cumulative food intake were observed, except for significant
increase in body weight in ZDF rats receiving metformin
alone (P ≤ 0.01) or the combination of TAK-875 and 
metformin (P ≤ 0.01; Figure 3). In vehicle-treated ZDF rats,
fasting plasma glucose levels began to elevate at week 2,
and reached hyperglycaemic levels (26.2 ± 1.2 mmol·L−1) at
week 6 (Figure 4A). A 6-week treatment with TAK-875, 
metformin and their combination showed a trend towards
decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels by 22.4, 15.1 and
37.9%, respectively, compared with vehicle (Figure 4A, B).
Consistent with fasting plasma glucose levels, GHb levels,
which reflect long-term glycaemic control, were 
significantly decreased by 1.7, 1.8 and 2.4% after 6 weeks of 
treatment with TAK-875, metformin and their combination,
respectively, compared with vehicle (Figure 4C), and an
additive GHb-lowering effect was observed in their 
combination (TAK-875, P ≤ 0.05; metformin, P ≤ 0.01; interaction,
not significant).
Multiple dosing of TAK-875 alone or in
combination with metformin prevents
β-cell dysfunction
To evaluate in vivo effects on pancreatic β-cell function, fasting
plasma insulin levels were examined in ZDF rats after multiple
dosing. In vehicle-treated ZDF rats, plasma insulin levels were
gradually elevated until 4 weeks of treatment, followed by a
rapid reduction (Figure 5A), indicating that progressive β-cell
dysfunction began around week 4. Plasma insulin levels at
week 6 remained 2.2- and 2.4-fold higher in the TAK-875 and
metformin groups, respectively, compared with the vehicle
group, although the increase was not statistically significant
(Figure 5A, B). In combination-treated ZDF rats, plasma
insulin levels continued to increase through the study period
with a maximal 3.2-fold increase compared with 
vehicle-treated rats (Figure 5A, B), and the additive increase was
observed at week 6 (TAK-875, P ≤ 0.05; metformin, P ≤ 0.01;
interaction, not significant). Furthermore, as assessed by
HOMA-β after 6 weeks of treatment, β-cell function was
increased 5.0-, 4.7- and 9.6-fold in the TAK-875, the 
metformin and the combination groups, respectively, and 
significant increases were observed in the metformin and the
combination group compared with vehicle (Figure 5C). As
often observed in type 2 diabetic patients, ZDF rats exhibited
elevated plasma glucagon levels compared with normal rats
(Figure 5D). In contrast to plasma insulin levels, plasma 
glucagon levels were not significantly changed by any of the 
treatments (Figure 5D). At week 6, vehicle-treated ZDF rats showed
significant increases in fasting plasma TG and TC levels, but
not NEFA levels, compared with normal rats (Table 1). Plasma
TG, TC and NEFA levels were not significantly changed by 6
weeks of treatment with TAK-875 (Table 1). In 
metformin-and the combination-treated rats, a significant increase in
plasma TG was observed compared with vehicle-treated rats
(Table 1). Altogether, these results indicate that long-term
activation of GPR40 by TAK-875 prevents progressive β-cell
dysfunction even in the presence of hyperlipidaemia, and the
effects are potentiated by the combination with metformin.

Pancreatic insulin content is maintained at
normal levels in rats given TAK-875 and
metformin in combination
Pancreatic hormone contents were measured at the end of
study period. In vehicle-treated ZDF rats, pancreatic insulin
content was significantly decreased to 37.7% of that in
normal rats (Figure 6A). After 44 days of treatment with 
TAK-875 and metformin, pancreatic insulin contents were 1.6-
and 2.2-fold higher, respectively, than in the vehicle group,
although the differences did not reach statistical significance
(Figure 6A). The combination of TAK-875 and metformin
maintained a significantly higher level of pancreatic insulin
content, which was almost equivalent to that in normal rats
(vehicle: 26, combination: 67.1; normal lean: 69.1 ng·mg−1
pancreas; Figure 6A). On the other hand, pancreatic glucagon
contents were not significantly different among the ZDF
groups (Figure 6B).
Structural abnormality and altered protein
expression necessary for β-cell function and
proliferation are improved by TAK-875 and
metformin in combination
Pancreata isolated from rats were analysed by 
immunohisto-chemistry using anti-insulin, anti-glucagon, anti-PDX-1 and
anti-PCNA antibodies at the end of the study period. 
Immu-nostaining for insulin revealed that islets in vehicle-treated
ZDF rats were enlarged and disorganized with extensions into
the surrounding exocrine tissue compared with those in
normal rats (Figure 7A, Q). Moreover, widespread distribution
of glucagon-positive α-cells and reduced PDX-1 expression
throughout the islets were observed in vehicle-treated ZDF
rats (Figure 7B, C, R, S). Multiple dosing of TAK-875 and
metformin did not produce detectable changes in islet 
morphology or in the expression of insulin, glucagon and PDX-1
in ZDF rats (Figure 7A-C, E-G, I-K). In contrast, in ZDF rats
receiving TAK-875 and metformin in combination, many
insulin-positive cells displayed relatively normal round and

vehicle-treated ZDF rats (Figure 7A, M). The distributions of
glucagon-positive cells in islets were not different between
the combination and vehicle groups (Figure 7B, N). 
Interestingly, high levels of PDX-1 expression were maintained in
nucleus and cytosol of islets from combination-treated ZDF
rats, as observed in those from ZL rats (Figure 7C, O, S).
Moreover, immunostaining of PCNA showed increased
PCNA-positive cell numbers in islets from the combination
group compared with the vehicle group (arrows in Figure 7P).
The double staining revealed the co-localizations of 
PCNA-positive nuclei with insulin staining in these islets (Support-
ing Information Figure S1). Taken together, these results
indicate that multiple dosing of TAK-875 and metformin in
combination could exert beneficial effects on pancreatic
β-cell function and mass in ZDF rats.

Discussion and Conclusions
TAK-875, a potent, selective and orally available GPR40
agonist, provides glucose-dependent insulin secretion
through activation of the Gαq-signalling pathway and 
amplification of intracellular Ca2+ (Tsujihata et al., 2011; Yashiro
et al., 2012), which is a mechanism distinct from those of
other clinically available oral insulinotropic drugs, including
SUs and DPP-4 inhibitors (Winzell and Ahren, 2007). We
previously showed that acute administration of TAK-875
improved postprandial hyperglycaemia due to augmentation
of insulin secretion in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats
(Tsujihata et al., 2011). In addition, it has been demonstrated
that TAK-875 significantly improved glycaemic control in
type 2 diabetic patients with minimum risk of hypoglycaemia
compared with SUs (Araki et al., 2012; Burant et al., 2012).
Given that TAK-875 could become a new class of 
anti-hyperglycaemic agent, there is a need to evaluate its
potential use in combination treatment with existing 
anti-hyperglycaemic agents. In the present study, we examined
the effects of combination treatment with TAK-875 and 
metformin, which is a first-line drug for treatment of type 2
diabetes, on glycaemic control, pancreatic β-cell function and
islet morphology in male ZDF rats. This model shows insulin
resistance at a young age, after which severe hyperglycaemia
and progressive β-cell dysfunction develop, due at least in
of GPR40 agonist and metformin BJPCombination
part to insufficient compensation for insulin resistance. It is
therefore suitable for evaluation of combination effects of
insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitizers (Lee et al., 1994;
Finegood et al., 2001).
In this study, 6-week multiple dosing of TAK-875 
significantly decreased GHb levels by 1.7%, and the efficacy was
almost comparable with that of metformin. Several 
nonclinical studies with GPR40 agonists other than TAK-875 have
been described in recent years. These results show that

peritoneal glucose tolerance test are well maintained in obese
rodents after multiple dosing (Tan et al., 2008; Lin et al.,
2011), indicating a lack of tachyphylaxis of GPR40 agonists.
However, distinct anti-diabetic effects by long-term 
activation of GPR40 have not been demonstrated. In this study, we
demonstrated for the first time that administration of the
GPR40 agonist TAK-875 not only acutely improved both 
postprandial and fasting hyperglycaemia, but also chronically
delayed the progression of diabetes in a rodent model. Our
findings strongly support clinical results (Araki et al., 2012;
Burant et al., 2012).
576 British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 170 568-580
While FFAs acutely stimulate insulin secretion, chronic
exposure to them is reported to cause β-cell dysfunction and
cell death. Although GPR40 has been considered to be 
possibly involved in lipotoxicity (Steneberg et al., 2005), a number
of experimental observations do not support a central role for
GPR40 in lipotoxicity (Latour et al., 2007; Kebede et al., 2008;
Nagasumi et al., 2009). In our previous study, prolonged
exposure to TAK-875 did not cause β-cell dysfunction in vitro,
in contrast to FFA (Tsujihata et al., 2011). In ZDF rats, 
hyperlipidaemia precedes the rise in plasma glucose, and these
lipotoxic effects on β-cells are thought to contribute to
gradual progression of β-cell dysfunction (Lee et al., 1994).
Actually, in the present study, hyperlipidaemia was observed
in ZDF rats compared with normal rats. Despite the high
plasma lipid levels, TAK-875 achieved the improvement in
glycaemic control with a trend towards increase in fasting
plasma insulin levels and pancreatic insulin content, and no
changes in islet morphology. These results indicate that 
long-term activation of GPR40 by TAK-875 could have beneficial
effects on pancreatic β-cell function even in the presence of
hyperlipidaemia. Our results support a previous in vitro study
showing that GPR40 is not involved in the chronic toxic
effects of FFAs (Tsujihata et al., 2011).
of GPR40 agonist and metformin BJPCombination
Metformin provides glucose-lowering effects via 
pleio-tropic mechanisms including decreased hepatic glucose 
production, increased peripheral glucose disposal and reduced
intestinal glucose absorption (Hundal and Inzucchi, 2003). As
expected from their complementary mechanisms of action,
acute administration of TAK-875 and metformin in 
combination resulted in a greater decrease in postprandial and fasting
hyperglycaemia compared with each drug alone, despite the
fact that insulin secretion was almost the same as that in rats
treated with TAK-875 alone. This insulin-sparing action of the
combination could lead to the alleviation of β-cell 
exhaustion. In fact, chronic dosing of TAK-875 and metformin in
British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 170 568-580 577

combination significantly decreased GHb levels by 2.4% and
prevented the progressive decline in plasma insulin levels,
both of which effects were greater than those seen with either
drug alone. Furthermore, the combination treatment showed
a significant increase in HOMA-β and pancreatic insulin
content, and the insulin content was comparable with that in
normal rats. As assessed by immunohistochemistry, normal
rounded islet architecture, elevated PDX-1 expression and
increased PCNA-positive cell numbers were observed in the
combination group. Considering that the balance of β-cell
proliferation and apoptosis can control pancreatic β-cell
mass, thereby forming islet architecture (Butler et al., 2003),
relatively normal islet architecture in the combination group
may be maintained due to increased β-cell proliferation. 
Altogether, these results suggest that this combination strategy is
effective for preserving β-cell function in ZDF rats.
The mechanism of the strong protective effects on β-cells
by the combination of TAK-875 and metformin is not fully
understood. Previous reports have demonstrated that 
prevention of progressive hyperglycaemia per se preserves
insulin and PDX-1 gene expression by relieving glucotoxicity
on β-cells in ZDF rats (Harmon et al., 1999). Thus, 
improvement in β-cell function in the combination group observed
in the present study may be mediated, at least in part, by
improved glycaemic control. On the other hand, Janssen
et al. (2003) have reported that glycaemic control by 
treatment with phlorizin, a renal sodium-dependent glucose
transport inhibitor, prevents the decrease in plasma insulin,
but not the progressive histochemical changes in islets in
these rats, implying the involvement of direct trophic effects
of TAK-875 and metformin on β-cell survival in our studies.
It has been very recently shown that chronic activation of
designer Gq-coupled receptor in β-cells leads to the 
sequential activation of ERK1/2 and IRS-2 signalling, thus triggering
a series of events that greatly improve β-cell function (Jain
et al., 2013). Because GPR40 is one of the Gq-coupled 
receptors highly expressed in β-cells, there is a possibility that
TAK-875 may directly activate ERK1/2 and IRS-2 cascade in
β-cells, leading to improved β-cell function. Indeed, it has
been reported that activation of GPR40 by endogenous
ligand FFA causes increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells (Itoh et al., 2003). While 
metformin suppresses hepatic glucose production in liver, the
direct effects in pancreatic β-cells have also been reported.
The therapeutic concentration of metformin has been also
shown to cause β-cell protection against glucolipotoxicity
(Lupi et al., 1999; 2002; Marchetti et al., 2004), although
there is an ongoing debate whether activation of AMPK has
positive or negative impact on pancreatic β-cell function (Fu
et al., 2013). These direct protective effects of TAK-875 and
metformin in β-cells might be particularly potentiated in
their combination treatment, by which the additive 
glycaemic control has been achieved. Further studies are required
to clarify how TAK-875 directly affects β-cell growth or how
TAK-875 and metformin can interact with each other in
β-cells. Alternatively, recent clinical observation indicates
that metformin increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
concentration (Mannucci et al., 2001). GPR40 is also
expressed in enteroendocrine cells, and mediates 
FFA-induced GLP-1 secretion (Edfalk et al., 2008). It is well known
that GLP-1 has protective effects on β-cells (Perfetti and Hui,
578 British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 170 568-580
2004). Although plasma GLP-1 levels were not assessed in
this study, the potential role of GLP-1 in the combination
effects should be assessed in a future study.
The combination of SU drugs and metformin is one of the
most frequently used combination therapies, but increases
the risk of hypoglycaemia (Blonde et al., 2002). Our study
showed that plasma glucose levels just before glucose load
(time 0) in ZDF rats receiving a combination of TAK-875 and
metformin were similar to those of normal rats. These results
suggest that the combination of TAK-875 and metformin may
pose a low risk of hypoglycaemia due to the 
glucose-dependent insulin secretion seen with TAK-875 (Tsujihata
et al., 2011). Combination therapy with metformin and
DPP-4 inhibitors, which augments insulin secretion via 
elevation of active forms of incretins, is currently attracting 
attention because of the additive improvement in glycaemic
control with a minimum risk of hypoglycaemia (Goldstein
et al., 2007). The recent in vitro report has shown that high
concentration of glucose or metformin regulates expressions
of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide
receptor, but not GPR40 in β-cells (Pan et al., 2009). In future
studies, it will be of interest to determine whether expression
of GPR40 can be regulated by diabetic condition and 
combination with other anti-diabetic drugs in vivo.
In diabetic patients, hyperglucagonemia has been
reported (Sloop et al., 2005) and is involved in 
hyperglycaemia by increasing hepatic glucose production. In the present
study, ZDF rats showed elevated plasma glucagon levels
compared with normal rats. It has been previously reported
that GPR40 mediates FFA-induced glucagon secretion via
GPR40 in α-cells (Flodgren et al., 2007). In our study, 
TAK-875 did not affect plasma glucagon levels, pancreatic 
glucagon content or distribution of glucagon-positive cells in
ZDF rats. These results are consistent with the previously
reported in vitro study using human pancreatic islets and in
clinical data on diabetic patients (Araki et al., 2012; Yashiro
et al., 2012).
In our study, increases in body weight were observed in
the metformin and the combination groups. Consistent with
these observations, the DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin and 
pioglitazone in combination increased body weight compared
with pioglitazone alone in db/db mice, a diabetic model with
progressive β-cell dysfunction like ZDF rats (Moritoh et al.,
2009). This may be associated with anabolic effects of
elevated plasma insulin. Moreover, significant increases in
fasting plasma TG levels in the metformin and combination
groups were observed at week 6 in this study. Because 
hyper-insulinaemia promotes hepatic lipogenesis via activation of
lipogenic transcriptional factor sterol regulatory 
element-binding protein-1c (Yecies et al., 2011), thereby causing an
increase in plasma TG levels, plasma TG levels in the 
vehicle-treated ZDF rats may have been decreased by the reduction of
plasma insulin levels at week 6.
In conclusion, the present study is the first to 
demonstrate that chronic activation of GPR40 by TAK-875 has the
potential to slow the progression of diabetes without 
accelerating the progression of β-cell dysfunction in a diabetic
animal model. Our findings also suggest that combination
therapy with TAK-875 and metformin may be a valuable
strategy for glycaemic control and β-cell preservation in
patients with type 2 diabetes.

Effects of 44 day treatment with TAK-875 (TAK), metformin (MET) and TAK in combination with MET on insulin staining, glucagon staining, PDX-1 
expression and PCNA-positive cell numbers in pancreatic islets from ZDF rats. ZDF rats were administered vehicle (A-D), 10 mg·kg−1, b.i.d. of TAK 
(E-H), 50 mg·kg−1, q.d. of MET (I-L), or their combination (M-P) for 44 days, and ZL rats were administered vehicle (Q-T). The pancreata were 
isolated and immunostained with anti-insulin (A, E, I, M, Q), anti-glucagon (B, F, J, N, R), anti-PDX-1 (C, G, K, O, S) and anti-PCNA (D, H, L, P, 
T) antibodies. Representative images for each group are shown. Arrows indicate PCNA-positive cells. Scale bar = 250 μm.
