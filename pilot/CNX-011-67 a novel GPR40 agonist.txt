Abstract
Background: GPR40 is a G-protein coupled receptor regulating free fatty acid induced and also glucose induced
insulin secretion. We generated neonatally-streptozotocin-treated female rats (n-STZ) and treated them with
CNX-011-67, a GPR40 agonist to examine the role of GPR40 in modulation of glucose metabolism, insulin secretion
and content.
Methods: Female n-STZ animals were orally administered with CNX-011-67 (15 mg/kg body weight, twice daily) or
with vehicle for 8 weeks (n = 8 per group). Glucose tolerance in treated animals and insulin secretion, islet insulin
content and gene expression in isolated islets were determined. Islets from type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients
were treated with different concentrations of glucose in presence or absence of CNX-011-67 and insulin secretion
was measured.
Results: Treatment of n-STZ rats with GPR40 agonist CNX-011-67 enhanced insulin secretion in response to oral
glucose load on day 0 and this response persisted during the treatment period. The treatment also produced a
‘memory effect’ during which insulin secretion in response to oral glucose load remained enhanced, for a week,
even in absence of the agonist. Activation of GPR40 enhanced responsiveness of islets to glucose and increased
glucose induced insulin secretion and islet insulin content. An increase in islet mRNA expression of GCK, PDX1,
insulin and PC was also observed. Acute treatment of islets from n-STZ rats with GPR40 agonist enhanced cellular
ATP content. Activation of GPR40 enhanced mitochondrial calcium level in NIT-1 insulinoma cells. CNX-011-67
increased insulin secretion in islets from T2DM patients which were non-responsive to increased glucose concentration
Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that activation of GPR40 with CNX-011-67 stimulates glucose metabolism,
enhances glucose responsiveness, increases insulin secretion and content and that pharmacological activation of
GPR40 will prove beneficial for treatment of T2DM.

Background
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is growing in 
epidemic proportions both in the developed and 
developing countries and is estimated to affect 438 million
humans world-wide by the year 2030 (World Diabetes
Foundation). Normally the β-cell responds to an 
increment in glucose with an increase in insulin to maintain
normoglycemia [1,2]. In response to oral glucose an
‘early phase’ insulin secretion is observed within the
first 30 min of ingestion which is reduced in subjects
with impaired glucose tolerance suggesting that an 
impaired first phase is perhaps the earliest detectable 
abnormality in individuals destined to develop T2DM
[3,4]. With onset of β-cells failure there is first a steady
increase in postprandial and fasting glucose 
concentrations leading finally to the development of overt 
diabetes [1,5-7].
Several therapeutic approaches have been adopted to
prevent and/or delay the defects in β-cell function [8,9].
Of relevance to this study is the role of the G protein
coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), also known as Free Fatty
Acid Receptor 1 in the regulation of β-cell function.
GPR40 is highly expressed in human β-cells, brain and
endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and is activated
by medium and long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids and enhance insulin secretion by activating cytosolic
calcium flux [10-12]. Over-expression of GPR40 increases
whereas its knockout decreases insulin secretion [13,14]
indicating its important role for insulin secretion and
glucose tolerance. Similarly, its expression is reduced in
T2DM islets and is positively correlated with insulin 
secretion [15]. Hence, GPR40 is an important therapeutic
target to treat T2DM. In fact a number of small molecule
agonists have been shown to modulate glucose 
stimulated insulin secretion. Different GPR40 agonists such
as GW9508, TAK-875, AS2575959, AMG837 and phenyl
propanoic acid derivatives have shown increased insulin
secretion in both insulinoma cells and/or in animal
models [16-20]. Among these agonists, TAK-875 has been
shown to prevent β-cells dysfunction [21] in animal model
of diabetes and improves glycemic control in T2DM 
patients [22,23]. However, none of these abovementioned
molecules have been reported to increase insulin secretion
in n-STZ model which has high β-cell stress.
While the precise primary defects that trigger β-cell
defects are not fully understood, islets from patients
with T2DM have been reported to display reduced
glucose oxidation [24,25], reduced ATP content in 
response to an acute glucose stimulation [26] and reduced
glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) [24,25,27].
These changes are associated with a decrease in 
expression of glucokinase (GCK), glucose transporter 1 and 2
(GLUT1 and 2), and alterations in genes involved in
insulin granule exocytosis [24,28,29].
Page 2 of 15
β-cell population in diabetics is reduced by 30% when
accompanied by deposition of islet amyloid [30,31] and a
50% decline in β-cell volume is observed in patients with
impaired fasting glucose [32]. The similar pathology was
reported in neonatal streptozotocin (n-STZ) rats [33-36].
Also stress in β-cell of this model is very high which is
similar to the stress seen in T2DM patient’s islets.
We have reported previously that chronic treatment of
male ZDF rats (insulin resistant model with elevated blood
glucose and free fatty acid levels) with CNX-011-67 
increased insulin secretion, decreased blood glucose and 
reduced β-cells apoptosis without affecting body weight
[37]. We have shown that chronic β-cell stress mediated
by glucolipotoxic conditions reduces GSIS, islet insulin
content, ATP levels and expression of genes such as GCK,
PDX1 and insulin [38]. Chronic treatment of CNX-011-67
was able to overcome these defects in β-cells functions
[37]. In the present study we were interested to evaluate
chronic activation of GPR40 in the neonatal 
streptozotocin (n-STZ) rats which manifests reduced β-cell number,
decreased GSIS and severe β-cell stress as seen in T2DM
patient islets [33-36]. Chronic treatment with CNX-011-
67 resulted in improved glucose responsiveness, phasic
glucose stimulated insulin secretion and increased islet
insulin content. CNX-011-67 also increased glucose 
stimulated insulin secretion in human islets from T2DM 
patient. These results suggest that activation of GPR40 by
CNX-011-67 will provide a novel therapeutic approach to
improve long-term glycemic control in T2DM patients by
regulating β-cell biology.
Methods
Reagents
Glucose was estimated
(Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Ultra-sensitive insulin
ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc, USA) was used to determine
plasma insulin levels. Insulin was estimated in in-vitro
studies using “ultra-sensitive insulin assay kit” (Mercodia,
Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Animals
In-bred Wistar rats were provided commercial pelleted
food (Provimi, India) and water ad libitum and 
maintained on a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle during the 
studies. All animal experiment procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Connexios
Life Sciences and were in accordance with the guidelines
of Committee For The Purpose Of Control And 
Supervision On Experiments On Animals (CPCSEA) Govt. of
India.
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
After a 16 h fast, CNX-011-67 (5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg
body weight) or vehicle was administered 30 min or
using Accu-check glucometer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/19
45 min prior to administration of glucose (2 g/kg b.wt)
by oral gavage (n = 8 per group). Blood samples were
collected from the tail vein 30 min or 45 min before
treatment and at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min after 
glucose load for estimating glucose and insulin.
Generation and treatment of n-STZ rats
Following breeding, pups were administered 50 mg/kg, i.p
of STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) or vehicle on day
2 and 3 of birth and allowed to be with their mothers until
weaning at 21 days of age. Subsequently, only animals that
were confirmed as glucose intolerant in an oral glucose
tolerance test (at the age of 17 weeks) were included in
the study. More than 95% of the animals that were 
administered with STZ were glucose intolerant at 17 week and
the rest of the animals developed glucose intolerance
2 weeks later.
Three experimental groups were studied, namely,
sham control, n-STZ control and n-STZ + CNX-011-67
(15 mg/kg b.wt.). CNX-011-67 was dissolved in water
and administered twice daily by oral gavage (15 mg/kg b.
wt.). The n-STZ control animals were administered 
vehicle (water). Four protocols were followed:
Protocol 1: n-STZ animals were treated with 
CNX-011-67 (twice daily, 15 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle
for 12 weeks (n = 8 per group) and oral glucose tolerance
test was performed on day 0 and week 8.
Protocol 2: n-STZ animals were treated with 
CNX-011-67 (twice daily, 15 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle
for 8 weeks (n = 8 per group) and islet mRNA was 
isolated for RT-PCR based analysis of gene expression.
Protocol 3: n-STZ animals were treated with 
CNX-011-67 (twice daily, 15 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle
for 8 weeks (n = 8 per group) and treatment was 
withdrawn for 1-week (ninth week of the study). OGTT was
performed after week 8 and again after one week of drug
withdrawal (9th week). Agonist treatment was 
reintroduced and continued for a further 3 weeks after which
glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content
were determined in islets isolated from the animals.
Protocol 4: Islets isolated from n-STZ rats were acutely
treated with CNX-011-67 and ATP content was measured.
Daily food intake and body weight were recorded for
all the animals in the above protocols
Islet isolation, gluose stimulated insulin secretion and
islet insulin content measurement
Animals were killed under anesthesia (due to ethical 
considerations; all groups of animals were similarly treated)
and pancreata were digested with collagenase-II (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) followed by islet separation in a
density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque (Sigma
diagnostics, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described ear
lier [39]. Size-matched islets were handpicked under a
Page 3 of 15
stereomicroscope (Nikon) and used for GSIS assay. Briefly,
islets were seeded in 24-well culture plates in 1 ml of
Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES (KRBH) buffer with
2.8 mM glucose and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Islets were
then treated with 1 μM of CNX-011-67 in the presence of
low (5.6 mM) or high (16.7 mM) glucose for 2 h. The 
culture supernatant was collected and stored at −70°C for
measurement of insulin. Islets were then lysed in lysis 
buffer and islet insulin content was measured. Both secreted
insulin and islet insulin content were normalized with
total protein measured using Bradford’s reagent (Bio-Rad).
Amount of secreted insulin was also normalized with islet
insulin content and represented as % of islet insulin
content.
Human islets from cadevar T2DM donars were 
procured from Prodo lab, USA. Size matched islets were
hand picked and incubated in KRBH containing 2.8 mM
glucose for 1 h. Islets were then incubated with different
concentrations of glucose with or without CNX-011-67
(1 μM) for 2 h. The supernatent was collected and used
for insulin measurement. Four islets were used in each
replicate for the GSIS.
Measurement of mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium flux
in N1T1 cells.
NIT1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Ham’s F12 medium
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glu-
tamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin
(All reagents from GIBCO, USA). For experiments, NIT-1
cells were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in 
96-well plates and incubated for 72 h. Cells were loaded with
Fluo-3 AM (Invitrogen, 2.5 μM) dye for cytosolic 
calcium measurement or Rhod-2 AM dye (Invitrogen, 4 μM)
for mitochondrial calcium measurement for 60 min and
washed twice with HEPES buffered saline solution (HBSS)
to remove unbound dye. Following a basal measurement,
cells were treated with low glucose (2.8 mM), high glucose
(16.7 mM) or high glucose with 1 μM of CNX-011-67 and
Ca2+ levels were measured for 4 min at 6-s intervals using
a Biotek Synergy 2 fluorimeter with resulting flux being
represented as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) [40].
Calcium levels represented refer to net response with 
background fluorescence corrections. There were no 
oscillations observed and the response was sustained for nearly
12 minutes.
Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from islets using Tri-reagent
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), followed by chloroform
extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. This total
RNA (500 ng) was used for cDNA synthesis by reverse
transcription (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). mRNA levels
were quantified using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Eurogenetic, Belgium) using 5 ng of cDNA. Genes

analyzed in the present study were GCK, PC, PDX1 and
insulin. For quantification of gene expression, β-actin
was used as internal control (primer sequences are 
available upon request).
Measurement of β-cell ATP and inositol-tri-phosphate
(IP3) content
After preincubation at 2.8 mM glucose for 60 min, groups
of ten islets were incubated in tubes containing 0.5 ml
KRBH buffer supplemented with 2.8 or 11 mM glucose
with or without 300 nM CNX-011-67 for 60 min for ATP
and 5 min for IP3 measurement. The islets were then
washed twice with 1X cold PBS and lysed in lysing buffer
provided by the manufacturer. ATP and IP3 concentrations
were measured using ATP determination kit (Molecular
Probes, USA) or Rat IP3 ELISA Kit (CUSABIO biotech,
China) in a Multi-Mode Micro plate Reader (SpectraMax
M5e, Molecular Devices, USA).
Histology and immunohistochemistry of β-cells
Pancreata were dissected out from the animals and fixed
in 10% buffered neutral formalin for 48 h. The entire
pancreas was collected, weighed, processed and 
paraffin-embedded. Each block was serially sectioned (4 μm)
throughout its length to avoid any bias from regional
changes in islet distribution and islet cell composition,
and sections were mounted on clean glass slides. Three
serial sections were obtained every 100 microns. One
was used for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the
remaining for immunofluorescence staining for insulin
and PDX1.
Immunofluorescence staining for insulin and PDX1 was
carried out using a goat anti-mouse FITC conjugated and
goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor conjugated secondary antibody
direct labeling technique, respectively. Sections were 
incubated for 1 h with anti-insulin (Abexome, India) and 
anti-PDX1 (Abcam, UK) antibodies. Thereafter, FITC- and
Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied
for 30 min. After staining, sections were mounted in 
fluro-mount (Sigma). All hematoxylin and eosin sections were
taken for histological evaluation under light microscope.
Images were captured using Zeiss fluorescence 
microscope using progres® capture pro 2.1 camera. 
Quantitative evaluation of total β-cell mass was performed using
a computer-assisted image analysis (progres®capturepro)
software. The relative volume of β-cells was determined
by a stereological morphometric method, calculating the
Page 4 of 15
ratio between the area occupied by immunoreactive cells
and that occupied by total pancreatic cells. Total β-cell
mass per pancreas was derived by multiplying this ratio
by the total pancreatic weight. The total β-cell nuclei
from all stained section were counted, to derive number
of β-cells per islet.
Electron microscopy studies
Pancreatic tissue was fixed in 3% gluteraldehyde for
24 h, washed with phosphate buffer twice and post-fixed
with 1% Osmium tetroxide. Tissues were then washed
with phosphate buffer twice and processed in different
grades of alcohol for dehydration and propylene oxide
for clearing. Tissues were infiltrated with a mixture
of propylene oxide: araldite (1:1) and incubated on a
rotator overnight at room temperature. Tissues were
transferred to fresh and pure araldite, incubated and
then embedded. Blocks were allowed to polymerize for
48 h at 60°C. Ultra thin sections were stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate and scanned in a 
Transmission Electron Microscope.
Statistical Analysis
Data values are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Significance
of differences among groups was determined using 
One-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s post-test
or by Students unpaired t-test. P value summary: (*)
<0.05, (**) <0.01 and (***) <0.001 respectively, when
compared with vehicle control.
Results
Phenotypic characterization of n-STZ rats prior to the
start of treatment
Table 1 gives body weight, fasting glucose and insulin
levels in the neonatally STZ treated adult (n-STZ) rats
and sham control rats at week 17 of age, 1 week before
commencement of treatment with CNX-011-67. There
was no significant difference in body weight and fasting
glucose between the sham control and n-STZ groups but
the n-STZ animals displayed decreased insulin area under
curve (AUC) and severe glucose intolerance during ‘Oral
Glucose Tolerance Test’ (OGTT). Fasting insulin levels in
n-STZ animals had declined to 0.174 ± 0.04 ng/ml as 
compared to 0.31 ± 0.05 ng/ml recorded in the sham control
animals.

Effect of GPR40 agonist treatment on insulin secretion
and glucose levels with and without glucose load in
Wistar rats
In normal Wistar rats, oral administration of 2 g/kg 
glucose resulted in a significant increase in insulin secretion
(0-30 min AUC 12.45 ± 1.55 vs 4.85 ± 0.63) when 
compared to control animals while treatment with CNX-011-
67 (5 mg/kg body weight) significantly enhanced insulin
secretion (0-30” AUC 16.23 ± 2.05 vs 12.45 ± 1.55, 31% 
increase, P < 0.05) in response to oral glucose (Figure 1A
lower panel and D) when compared with glucose control.
There was a significant decrease in glucose AUC in 
CNX-011-67 treated animals when compared to untreated 
animals (0-120 min AUC 14716 ± 360 vs 17400 ± 535, 39%
decrease, P < 0.001) (Figure 1A upper panel and C). In
absence of oral glucose challenge, treatment with 
CNX-011-67 (15 mg/kg body weight) did not either increase 
insulin secretion (0-30 min AUC 10.18 ± 1.7 vs 11.73 ± 1.9)
(Figure 1B lower panel and E) or decrease blood 
glucose levels (0-120 min AUC 11049 ± 362 vs 11272 ± 176)
(Figure 1B upper panel and F).
Effect of GPR40 agonist treatment on early phase insulin
secretion and glucose tolerance in n-STZ rats
The n-STZ group of animals showed loss of insulin 
secretion capacity in response to an oral glucose challenge
(Figure 2A, lower panel). Insulin secretion in response to
oral glucose load increased (1.8 fold) in the n-STZ-CNX-
011-67 treated animals after administration of the first
dose itself (day 0) leading to a significant improvement
in glucose tolerance when compared to the (untreated)
n-STZ animals (AUCglucose 20057 ± 885 vs 30433 ± 865
respectively, n = 8; P < 0.01; Figure 2A upper panel). The
improvement in glucose tolerance was almost similar to
the glucose tolerance observed in the sham control 
animals (AUCglucose 17900 ± 217). Chronic administration
of CNX-011-67 to n-STZ animals showed no impact on
body weight and feed consumption. Histological analysis
did not show any organ related toxicity (data not shown).
After 8 weeks of treatment with CNX-011-67 agonist, a
similar increase in insulin secretion (2-fold, Figure 2B
lower panel) in response to oral glucose load and 
improvement in glucose tolerance was observed in the
n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals compared to the untreated
n-STZ animals (17225 ± 786 vs 32480 ± 1697 respectively,
n = 8; P < 0.01; Figure 2B upper panel) and this improved
glucose tolerance was again similar to the glucose tolerance
observed in the sham control animals group (18094 ± 501).
Similarly, the increase in insulin secretion in first 30 min,
on day 0, led to a significant improvement in glucose 
tolerance in the n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals when compared
to the untreated n-STZ animals (area under the 0-30 min
glucose curve: 4232 ± 182 vs 5725 ± 358, respectively,
n = 8; P < 0.01; Figure 2A upper panel) and was similar to
Page 5 of 15
the glucose tolerance observed in the vehicle treated sham
control animals (AUCglucose 4221 ± 102). A similar 
increase in insulin secretion and improvement in glucose 
tolerance at 30 min post oral glucose load was also observed
after 8 weeks of treatment with the n-STZ-CNX-011-67
agonist. A significant aspect of the n-STZ-CNX-011-67
agonist action is the steep increase in the early phase 
insulin secretion (~1.8-2 fold increase) at 15 min and the 
significant glucose clearance within 30 min of the oral
glucose load. These data indicate that treatment of n-STZ
animals with the CNX-011-67 enhanced glucose sensitivity
of β-cells and almost normalized insulin secretion in 
response to oral glucose load.
Effect of withdrawal of CNX-011-67 treatment on insulin
secretion in response to oral glucose load
To understand if the chronic effects induced by 
CNX-011-67 agonist were maintained in the long term n-STZ-
CNX-011-67 animals were administered the agonist for
8 weeks and then the treatment was withdrawn for a
period of 1 week. Oral glucose tolerance test was 
performed at end of 8 weeks and again after one week of
agonist withdrawal. Since the half life of CNX-011-67
agonist is 6 h in Wistar rats (data not shown), it is unlikely
that the compound administered a week earlier remained
in circulation in the n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals. The
similar profiles of the oral glucose tolerance tests 
performed prior to (increase in 27% insulin AUC in n-STZ-
CNX-011-67 in 8th week, P < 0.001, Figure 2C lower
panel) and 1 week after agonist withdrawal (35% increase
in insulin AUC in the 9th week, P < 0.05, Figure 2D lower
panel) respectively indicates that the β-cells in the n-STZ-
CNX-011-67 animals remained responsive to glucose even
in the absence of the agonist. It appears that the 
CNX-011-67 induced β-cell population in the n-STZ-CNX-011-
67 remains functional and sensitive to stimulatory glucose
concentrations even in absence of the agonist.
Effect of CNX-011-67 on GSIS, insulin content of islets,
β-cell mass and number
Freshly isolated size-matched islets from sham control,
n-STZ and n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals (8 weeks 
treat-ment) were tested in vitro in a static glucose stimulated
insulin secretion (GSIS) assay. Islets from sham control
animals displayed the expected steep increase in insulin
secretion upon high glucose stimulation while islets
from the n-STZ animals, in sharp contrast, displayed a
weak insulin secretory response (60% decrease compared
to sham control, P < 0.001) indicating a significant loss
of β-cell sensitivity to glucose (Figure 3A). However,
islets from the n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals displayed a
55% increase (P < 0.05) in insulin secretory (Figure 3A)
response that was significantly greater than that 
observed in islets from n-STZ animals indicating a robust

improvement in β-cell sensitivity to glucose upon 
CNX-011-67 treatment. Analyses of islet insulin content from
the three groups showed a similar trend (Figure 3B). 
Insulin content in the islets from n-STZ animals was reduced
(48% decrease compared to sham control, P < 0.001) 
indicating a potential reduction in insulin biosynthesis. In
contrast, islets from n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals 
exhibited a 41% increase (P < 0.05) in insulin content 
compared to the n-STZ group and more importantly, an
increase in insulin biosynthesis was observed upon 
exposure to 16.7 mM glucose (Figure 3B) indicating increased
response to glucose stimulation. When expressed as 
percent of islet insulin content, insulin secretion from islets
prepared from n-STZ animals displayed a 22% decrease
(P < 0.05, Figure 3C) while islets from n-STZ-CNX-011-67
animals displayed only a 4% decrease when compared
with sham controls. However, the islets from n-STZ-
CNX-011-67 animals displayed a 20% increase, though
non-significant (P < 0.08), when compared with islets from
n-STZ animals (Figure 3C).
Since pancreatic islets from n-STZ animals resemble
T2DM human islets in terms of increased stress and 
reduced insulin secretion, we sought to measure insulin 
secretion in human islets obtained from T2DM cadaver
donors and studied impacts on CNX-011-67 treatment.
As shown in Figure 3D, T2DM human islets did not 
secrete elevated levels of insulin in response to physiological
stimulatory glucose concentration (8 mM). Insulin 
secretion was increased to some extent only at 11 mM glucose
concentration and further increase in glucose level
showed no further insulin secretion. Treatment of T2DM
human islets with CNX-011-67 increased insulin secretion
only at stimulatory glucose concentration (8 mM) and
had no impact at lower glucose levels (upto 5 mM)
(Figure 3D). These data thus further indicate that 
activation of GPR40 by CNX-011-67 can increase insulin 
secretion in a glucose dependent manner.
Immunohistochemical analysis of islet sections from
sham control, n-STZ and n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals 
revealed a modest increase in insulin (Figure 4A) and PDX-1
(Figure 4B) immunofluorescence while electron 
microscopic studies indicated presence of higher number of
electron-dense insulin granules in n-STZ-CNX-011-67
animals (Figure 4C). However, the effect of treatment with
CNX-011-67 on β-cell number and β-cell mass was 
statistically non-significant (Figure 4D & E). Hematoxylin and
eosin staining of pancreas showed no detectable change in
morphology or structure (data not shown).
Effect of CNX-011-67 on mitochondrial and cytosolic
calcium content
As GPR40 is coupled to Gα-q/11 protein and specific
ligands like oleic acid induce an increase in cytosolic 
calcium, we explored whether CNX-011-67 increased 
cytosolic Ca2+ levels. While exposure to stimulatory glucose
concentration in NIT-1 cells led to a 43% increase in 
cytosolic [Ca2+] consistent with earlier reports [41-44], the
presence of CNX-011-67 resulted in a further increase by
24% in cytosolic [Ca2+] (Figure 5A). GPR40 agonism by
CNX-011-67 thus led to a significant augmentation of
cytosolic [Ca2+] over that induced by stimulatory glucose
concentrations. CNX-011-67-mediated increase in 
cytosolic [Ca2+] levels were however dependent on presence of
calcium in extracellular medium as inhibition of voltage
dependent calcium channels by nitrendipine abrogated 
increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] levels (data not shown). As
GPR40 activation enhanced endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
release, we next examined if this could lead to an increase
in mitochondrial [Ca2+]. In NIT-1 cells, while exposure to
stimulatory glucose concentrations led to a 20% increase
in mitochondrial [Ca2+], presence of CNX-011-67 caused
a further increase by 13% in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels
(Figure 5B).
Effect of treatment with CNX-011-67 on islet ATP and
inositol-tri-phosphate (IP3) content in n-STZ islets
Freshly isolated islets from sham control animals 
displayed enhanced ATP synthesis when exposed to 
stimulatory glucose concentration and this was enhanced further
in the presence of CNX-011-67 (P < 0.01, Figure 5C). On
the contrary, ATP synthesis in islets freshly isolated from
n-STZ animals was already high, as previously reported
[45], even at low glucose concentrations when compared
to sham control, and exposure to stimulatory glucose
levels induced only a marginal increase in ATP synthesis
as expected. However, the presence of CNX-011-67 
restored ATP synthesis in the islets from n-STZ animals in
response to stimulatory glucose concentrations to almost

control levels suggesting enhanced glucose metabolism
(P < 0.01, Figure 5C). IP3 content in islets was also 
significantly enhanced by addition of CNX-011-67 in
agreement with earlier observations [46] that the signal
transduction of GPR40 involves phospholipase C 
activation, and elevation of intracellular IP3 leading to 
intracellular calcium release (Figure 5D).
Treatment with CNX-011-67 enhances expression of
factors regulating glucose metabolism and insulin
synthesis
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
CNX-011-67 mediated increase in insulin secretion and
insulin content, we examined the expression of factors
regulating glucose metabolism and insulin synthesis in
islets isolated from sham control, n-STZ and n-STZ-
CNX-011-67 rats (Figure 6). In n-STZ animals while 
expression of PDX-1 was decreased (P < 0.05, Figure 6A),
expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC, Figure 6D) was
significantly increased and that of glucokinase (GCK,
Figure 6B) and insulin genes (Figure 6C) remained 
unchanged when compared with sham controls. Expression
of all these four factors showed a significant increase in
the islets from n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats indicating that
chronic treatment with CNX-011-67 has a beneficial 
effect on expression of genes that are critical for regulating
glucose metabolism and insulin synthesis.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to investigate the 
therapeutic effects of CNX-011-67, a specific GPR40 agonist,
in ameliorating the defects in glucose responsiveness of
β-cells and insulin secretion in the neonatally 
STZ-treated adult Wistar rat model. Female rats were 
selected for the present study as loss in insulin secretion
capacity in neonatally STZ treated adult animals remain
uniform irrespective of the sex of the animals [47]. The
n-STZ model represents a model having reduced β-cell

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/19
number and increased β-cells stress indicating thus the
β-cells pathology in this model is similar to what seen in
human diabetic patients [30-32]. Acute treatment with
CNX-011-67 induced a significant increase in insulin
secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation and
chronic treatment for eight weeks induced significant
changes in expression of genes involved in glucose 
metabolism and insulin synthesis leading to enhanced 
insulin content in islets.
A number of small molecules such as GW9508, 
TAK-875, AS2575959 and AMG837 have been synthesized to
activate GPR40 to induce insulin secretion [16-20] in
different model systems. However, none of these 
molecules have shown for their potency to increase insulin
secretion in n-STZ animals, a model where β-cell stress
is high. Moreover, it is not clear from present literature
HG +CNX-011-67HGLG
whether GPR40 activation has any impact on β-cells 
glucose metabolism which is an important factor for insulin
release. Though, Alquier et al. [14] reported that GPR40
knock out did not alter fuel metabolism under normal
condition, the same can not be corroborated for GPR40
activation under disease conditions. In this report and in
the earlier study [37] we provide evidences, though 
indirectly, that CNX-011-67 increases glucose metabolism
in β-cells.
Since, increased insulin secretion for prolonged period
can cause β-cells exhaustion which can instead 
complicate the pathology, it become important to study
whether the increase in insulin secretion by GPR40 
activation has any impact on islet insulin content. 
Interestingly, we have observed that CNX-011-67 can actually
increase the islet insulin content despite increasing
Page 11 of 15
200
insulin secretion thereby indicating that insulin synthesis
is improved. This was further substantiated by increased
expression of insulin and PDX1.
It is well known that increase in β-cell glucose 
metabolism and ATP synthesis activates voltage-gated Ca2+
channels culminating in influx of extracellular Ca2+ and
insulin granule exocytosis [48,49]. Acute treatment with
CNX-011-67 significantly enhanced cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial [Ca2+] in NIT-1 cells and increased IP3
and ATP levels in islets prepared from normal Wistar
rats and n-STZ rats, respectively. These observations
suggest that acute exposure of n-STZ islets to CNX-011-
67 perhaps leads to an increase in islet cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial [Ca2+] levels [50,51] leading to activation of
the dehydrogenases of the citric acid cycle and enhanced
ATP content observed in the n-STZ islets (Figure 5C).
The defective Calcium-activated oxidative metabolism
and ATP synthesis reported in islets in n-STZ animal
models [52] is likely overcome by acute treatment with
CNX-011-67 and results in enhanced insulin secretion in
response to stimulatory glucose concentrations.
The above sequence of molecular alterations perhaps
explains the enhanced insulin secretion observed in the
n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats on day 0 itself, following the
first exposure to CNX-011-67 (Figure 2A). The acute
phase of insulin release observed in the first 10 min 
following oral glucose stimulation in the n-STZ-CNX-011-
67 rats on day 0 is attributable to mechanisms such as
enhanced mitochondrial [Ca2+], glucose metabolism and
ATP synthesis, that together trigger exocytosis of a small
number of insulin granules from the readily releasable
pool in a KATP channel-dependent manner as described
previously [53-55]. Such an effect is also evident in the
acute reversal of loss of insulin secretion observed in
Sunil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/19
islets from n-STZ rats after exposure to CNX-011-67
suggesting that the mechanism of action of the agonist
ensures glucose responsiveness and enhances hormone
secretion. This explains, in part, the acute increase in
insulin secretion observed on day 0 of treatment with
CNX-011-67. A similar acute effect on glucose 
stimulated insulin secretion was also evident in normal Wistar
rats (Figure 1). The robust insulin secretion observed
after eight weeks of treatment with the GPR40 agonist
suggested an improvement in β-cell number or function.
The enhanced glucose stimulated insulin secretion and
insulin content observed in cultured islets prepared from
the n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats when exposed to 16.7 mM
glucose (Figure 3A & B) indicates an improvement in
glucose responsiveness of the β-cells and is also one 
reason for the sustained insulin secretion observed in the
treated animals.
In the n-STZ animals, the reduced insulin secretion
and insulin content can be explained by defective 
mitochondrial activity leading to reduced ATP synthesis in
spite of normal expression levels of mRNA of GCK,
insulin and PC genes involved in upstream events of 
glucose metabolism. The increase in mRNA levels of PDX1,
GCK and PC in the n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats indicates
improved glucose metabolism (Figure 6 A, B & D) 
initiated by the agonist while the increase in insulin mRNA
and higher ATP availability support higher insulin 
synthesis (Figures 6C and 5C).
Even though we have not provided any direct evidence
to support that GPR40 activation enhances β-cell 
glucose oxidation our study provides indirect evidence to
link activation of GPR40 with enhanced glucose 
metabolism in β-cells. Since glucose metabolism and ATP
content are directly related in pancreatic β-cells and we
observed an increase in ATP content hence we speculate
that glucose metabolism is increased. Moreover, GCK
expression is reported to be reduced after STZ treatment
[56] leading to a reduced glucose metabolism, and with
CNX-011-67 treatment we observed an up-regulated 
expression of GCK further indicating that glucose 
metabolism in enhanced after CNX-011-67 treatment.
The near-normal insulin secretory response to oral
glucose maintained in n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats even
after the withdrawal of the agonist can be explained by
the change in expression of multiple genes involved in
glucose metabolism and insulin synthesis. For example,
it has been previously reported that in Zucker diabetic
fatty rats a reduced expression of GLUT2 was associated
with reduced insulin response to higher glucose 
concentrations, and transgenic overexpression of GLUT2
rescued the mice from early death [57,58]. Treatment of
n-STZ rats with sodium tungstate enhanced 
phospho-rylation of PDX-1 and increased β-cell replication and
insulin producing cells [25].
Page 13 of 15
In the present study, the significant increase in islet
insulin content and modest increase in area of insulin
positive cells observed after 12 weeks treatment with
CNX-011-67 most likely occurs due to a synergy 
resulting from a coordinated increase in expression of PDX1,
and genes (insulin, GCK, and PC) involved in glucose
metabolism and ATP synthesis. The electron 
micrographs not only indicate the preponderance of dense
insulin granules in islets from n-STZ-CNX-011-67 rats,
almost similar to the islets from sham control rats, but
also show that there is an increase in the number of
granules docked at the membrane and ready for release
upon glucose stimulation. It may be mentioned here that
treatment of Wistar rats with CNX-011-67 at 5 and
15 mg/kg did not increase serum GLP1 levels and hence
the effects observed in the β-cells in this study are 
attributable to the direct activation of GPR40 on β-cells by
CNX-011-67. We recently reported a similar increase in
ATP synthesis, islet insulin content and enhanced early
phase insulin secretion in male ZDF rats upon treatment
with CNX-011-67 [37].
The decrease in insulin secretion in T2DM patients
is attributed both to a loss in β-cell mass and to an
increase in number of β-cells that respond poorly to 
glucose [59]. Pancreatic β-cells from diabetic patients 
display a decrease in expression of GCK, GLUT 1 and 2,
genes involved in insulin granule exocytosis, show 
reduced glucose oxidation and ATP content resulting in
reduced glucose stimulated insulin release. Further, 
patients with T2DM display a reduced early phase insulin
secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation. The
incretin glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has 
demonstrated trophic effects on β-cells as evidenced by 
increased differentiation of pancreatic ductal cells, reduced
apoptosis and enhanced proliferation of β-cells in animal
models [60] and incretin-based therapies have been
developed to treat T2DM in humans. On account of its
ability to enhance Gαq/11 signaling, GPR40 agonism
represents a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate
the defects in insulin secretion observed in patients with
T2DM. The phenotype of impaired glucose metabolism,
lower content of insulin, lower rate of insulin 
biosynthesis and content and a persistent impairment of 
insulin release especially at higher glucose concentration
appear to be similar in islets from adult n-STZ rats and
from T2DM patients.
Chronic treatment of CNX-011-67 did not show any
impact on body weight, feed consumption and 
pancreata histology and also no toxic effects were observed.
Thus, CNX-011-67 is a novel, non-toxic, potent small
molecule having insulin secretion ability in a glucose
dependent manner. These results are in consistent with
our earlier study [37] where we have shown insulin 
secreting ability of CNX-011-67 in male ZDF animal
Sunil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/19
model without any detectable impact on feed intake or
body weight. Taken together, CNX-011-67 is an orally
available small molecule capable of enhanced insulin 
secretion in a glucose dependent manner. Therefore, the
CNX-011-67 holds promise as a future therapeutic
agent to meet the demand of insulin secretion in T2DM
patients whose β-cells are under chronic stress.
Conclusions
This study suggests that β-cells that are non-responsive
to glucose, for various reasons, can be pharmacologically
revived by CNX-011-67- mediated activation of GPR40
to synthesize and secrete insulin in response to glucose
stimulation. The ability of CNX-011-67 to overcome the
‘glucose incompetence’ of islet β-cells and increase 
insulin secretion and content in response to stimulatory 
glucose concentrations has clear implications for treating
T2DM.

Figure 1 Effect of CNX-011-67 in normal wistar rats and rat islets- OGTT glucose, insulin and GSIS. Effects of CNX-011-67 on blood glucose 
and insulin levels in normal Wistar rats with (A) and without glucose load (B). The rats were dosed with vehicle or CNX-011-67 by oral gavage at −45 min, 
blood samples obtained at the time intervals indicated in the graphs for glucose and insulin estimation. Effects of CNX-011-67 on total blood glucose 
(C) & insulin (D) AUC during the OGTT in Wistar rats. Effects of CNX-011-67 on total insulin (E) & blood glucose (F) AUC during the OGTT without 
glucose load in Wistar rats. The percent inhibition of glucose levels was calculated based on the glucose AUC during the 0-120 min OGTT for each 
group after subtracting the values from those of the normal (no drug and no glucose) control group. Data in all panels are mean ± SEM (n = 8/group). 
Statistical comparison between control and treatment group was conducted by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post test correction. (*P < 0.05 
and ** P < 0.01).

Figure 3 CNX-011-67 increases islet insulin secretion and content. Insulin secretion (A), islet insulin content (B), ratio of secreted insulin to 
insulin content represented as percentage (C) of islets from sham control, n-STZ and n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals after treatment with CNX-011-67 
for 8 weeks. Freshly isolated rat islets were preincubated with 2.8 mM glucose for 30 min and later incubated with 5.6 mM and 16.7 mM glucose 
for 120 min. Both insulin secretion and islet insulin content were measured. Secreted insulin and islet insulin content are presented as ng of 
insulin/mg protein. (D) CNX-011-67 increases insulin secretion in human islets from T2DM patients. The islets from T2DM did not show glucose 
responsiveness as elevated glucose concentration (8 mM) could not increase insulin secretion. CNX-011-67 treatment resulted in increased 
glucose responsiveness as CNX-011-67 facilitated insulin secretion only at higher glucose concentration. Values represent mean ± S.E.M (n = 4). 
Statistical analysis was performed by Students t-test (Two-way, unpaired: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001). 

Figure 4 CNX-011-67 improves islet insulin content, β-cell mass and number-immuno fluorescence staining and elctron microscope 
studies of CNX-011-67 treatment in islets and β-cell. Sections from sham control, n-STZ and n-STZ-CNX-011-67 Islets stained for insulin 
content using Immuno fluorescent staining (FITC; green) (A). Double immuno fluorescence staining for PDX1 (red; alexafluor 555) and insulin 
(green; FITC) representing all groups (B). Electron microscope images of β-cells from sham control, n-STZ and n-STZ-CNX-011-67 animals, treated 
animals showed improvement and increased number of dense-core insulin granules when compared with n-STZ animals. Mitochondria and 
endoplasmic reticulum health have restored in treatment (C). White arrow: nucleus, white arrowheads: mitochondria, black arrowheads: insulin 
vesicles. The n-STZ animals showed decreased β-cell number and mass when compared with normal control animals. The treated animals 
exhibited non significant increase in the β-cell number and β-cell mass (D & E). Images were taken at 40× magnification for immunohistochemical 
analysis and 4800× magnification for electron micrographs. Scale bar: 5 μm. Data in all panels are mean ± S.E.M (n = 6). Statistical analysis was 
performed by Students t-test (two-way, unpaired: *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001).

Figure 5 CNX-011-67 increases both cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium in NIT1 cells and ATP levels in rat islets. Cultured NIT1 cells 
were loaded with Fluo-3 AM dye for cytosolic calcium measurement (A) and Rhod-2 AM dye for mitochondrial calcium measurement (B) for 
60 min. Following a basal measurement, cells were treated with low glucose (2.8 mM), high glucose (16.7 mM) or high glucose (16.7 mM) with 
1 μM of CNX-011-67 followed by measurement of Ca2+ levels for 4 min at 6-s intervals. The resulting flux was represented as arbitrary fluorescent 
units (n = 3). (C) Islet ATP content from sham control and n-STZ animals. (D) Islet IP3 content in normal Wistar rat islets. Islets were preincubated 
with 2.8 mM glucose for 1 h and later incubated with low glucose (LG, 2.8 mM), high glucose (HG, 11 mM) or high glucose (11 mM) with 1 μM 
of CNX-011-67 for 60 min for ATP and 5 min for IP3 measurement. ATP (pmol) and IP3 (pg) content are presented per islet. Values represent 
mean ± S.E.M (n = 4). Statistical analysis was performed by Students t-test (Two-way, unpaired: * P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.01).
