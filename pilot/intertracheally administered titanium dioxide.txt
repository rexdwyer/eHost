AEROSIL1 P25 titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles dispersed in 0.2% disodium phosphate solution
were intratracheally administered to male F344 rats at doses of 0 (control), 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and
6.0 mg/kg. The rats were sacrificed under anesthesia at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 4 weeks, 13 weeks, and
26 weeks after administration. Ti levels in various pulmonary and extrapulmonary organs were
determined using sensitive inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry. One day after
administration, the lungs contained 62-83% of TiO2 administered dose. Twenty-six weeks after
administration, the lungs retained 6.6-8.9% of the TiO2 administered at the 0.375, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/kg
doses, and 13% and 31% of the TiO2 administered at the 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg doses, respectively. The
pulmonary clearance rate constants from compartment 1, k1, were estimated using a 2-compartment
model and were found to be higher for the 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg doses of TiO2 (0.030/day for both) than
for TiO2 doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg (0.014-0.022/day). The translocation rate constants from compartment
1 to 2, k12, were estimated to be 0.015 and 0.018/day for the 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg doses, and
0.0025-0.0092/day for doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg. The pulmonary clearance rate constants from
compartment 2, k2, were estimated to be 0.0086 and 0.0093/day for doses of 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg,
and 0-0.00082/day for 1.5-6.0 mg/kg doses. Translocation of TiO2 from the lungs to the thoracic lymph
nodes increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, accounting for 0.10-3.4% of the administered
dose at 26 weeks. The measured thoracic lymph node burdens were a much better fit to the thoracic
lymph node burdens estimated assuming translocation from compartment 1 to the thoracic lymph
nodes, rather than those estimated assuming translocation from compartment 2 to the thoracic lymph
nodes. The translocation rate constants from the lungs to the thoracic lymph nodes, kLung!Lym, were
0.000037-0.00081/day, and these also increased with increasing doses of TiO2. Although a small amount
of TiO2 had translocated to the liver by 3 days after the administration (0.0023-0.012% of the highest dose
administered, 6.0 mg/kg), translocation to the other extrapulmonary organs was not detected.

internationally. Nano-sized titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles
(primary particle size <100 nm), one of the most typical industrial
nanomaterials, have been utilized in sunscreen, cosmetics, and
photo catalysis since the 1980s. Global demand for TiO2 
nanomaterials was estimated at 2100-2500 tons per year in 2008
(Fuji Chimera Research Institute, Inc., 2009). Since TiO2 is 
water-insoluble and inert, it is generally regarded as having low toxicity
in humans and is even used as an additive in food products.
However, nano-sized particles may be more toxic or show a more
widespread organ distribution than micron-sized particles
2 N. Shinohara et al. / Toxicology 325 (2014) 1-11
(Donaldson et al., 2001, 2004; Oberdörster et al., 2005; De Jong
et al., 2008).
In order to evaluate the toxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles,
toxicokinetic data are beneficial. Since it is well established that
pulmonary clearance of particles is inhibited following the
administration of higher doses, a phenomenon known as overload
(Morrow,1992), it is important to evaluate the dose-dependency of
pulmonary clearance when considering inhalation toxicity. In
addition, after inhalation or intratracheal administration of TiO2
nanoparticles, Ti have been detected in the lungs and 
lung-associated lymph nodes, while Ti levels in other organs such as the
liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain were below the detection limit
(Bermudez et al., 2004; Ma-Hock et al., 2009; van Ravenzwaay
et al., 2009; Oyabu et al., 2013; Sager et al., 2008).
One-compartment models have been often used for the
evaluation of pulmonary clearance (Bermudez et al., 2004; Oyabu
et al., 2013). First order clearance rate constants for highly
persistent substances often decrease as the observation period
increases. Therefore, first order clearance rate constants estimated
by using a 1-compatment model over different observation periods
cannot be compared with each other. In addition, a 1-compartment
model does not fit the measured burden closely. A 
two-compartment model was reported to provide a better fit to the
measured burden and can be applied to evaluate both faster and
slower clearances (Shinohara et al., 2010). However, there are no
studies evaluating the clearance of TiO2 nanoparticles from the
lung using a 2-compartment model.
The present study aimed to elucidate dose-dependent 
pulmonary clearance kinetics and dose-dependent translocation kinetics
to extrapulmonary organs of TiO2 nanoparticle. In this study, we
administered TiO2 nanoparticles intratracheally to rats at 5 doses
and investigated their pulmonary clearance and translocation from
the lung to extrapulmonary organs over 26 weeks. We determined
the TiO2 burden in the lungs after sampling of bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF), BALF, and trachea, as well as the thoracic lymph
nodes (right and left posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, 
parathymic lymph nodes), liver, spleen, and kidneys using a highly
sensitive inductively coupled plasma sector field mass 
spectroscopy (ICP-SFMS; double-focusing ICP-MS). The pulmonary 
clearance rate constants estimated using a classical 2-compartment
model were compared over a range of doses. AEROSIL1 P25 TiO2
nanoparticles, which have often been employed for toxicity testing
of TiO2 nanoparticles and have been shown to induce lung
inflammation (Rehn et al., 2003; Sager et al., 2008; Warheit et al.,
2007) were used in the present study.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Preparation of TiO2 suspension
AEROSIL1 P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Evonik Industries,
Germany), consisting of approximately 80% anatase and 20% rutile
forms of TiO2, were used in the present study. These spherical
21 nm particles had a specific surface of 50  15 m2/g, and >99.5%
purity (Catalog value; Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.).
P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (2 g) were sonicated in 50 mL of 0.2%
disodium phosphate solution (DSP) (food additive grade, Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. , Japan) for 3 h in an ultrasonic bath
(5510J-MT; Branson Ultrasonics Co., USA) and then centrifuged at
1000  g for 30 min at 20 C (CF16RXII and T15A41; Hitachi Koki
Co., Ltd. , Japan). Supernatant (30 mL) was collected as stock
suspension. The concentration of the stock suspension was
determined by weight (AUW220D; Shimadzu Co., Japan) after
drying in a thermostatic chamber (ON-300S; Asone Co., Japan).
Suspensions of 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/mL were prepared
for administration by diluting the stock suspension with 0.2% DSP.
The size distribution and z potential of the TiO2 nanoparticles in
the administered suspension were determined by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (Zetasizer nano-ZS; Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
UK). The specific surface area of TiO2 nanoparticles in administered
suspension was determined using the BET-method after washing
with pure water and drying in a thermostatic chamber.
2.2. Experimental procedure
All animal were treated in accordance with the guideline for the
animal experiment ofourlaboratory whichreferredtothe guidelines
of Ministry of the Environment, Japan, Ministry of Health, Labourand
Welfare, Japan, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan,
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology,
Japan. The present experiment was approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee, Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute, Japan,
and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
Male F344/DuCrlCrlj rats were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). The animals were
12 weeks old with mean body weight of 246 g (range, 215-273 g) at
the start of the study. Rats were anesthetized by isoflurane
inhalation and treated by intratracheal administration of five
concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles (0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and
6.0 mg/mL) and negative control (0.2% DSP) at 1 mL/kg body
weight using MicroSprayer1 Aerosolizer (Model IA-1B-R for Rat;
Penn-Century, Inc., USA).
Five rats in each group were euthanized and dissected at 1 day,
3days,7days,4weeks,13weeks,and26weeksafterTiO2nanoparticle
administration. The animals were euthanized by exsanguination
from the abdominal aorta under intraperitoneal pentobarbital
anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight). Thereafter, the trachea was
cannulated with a disposable feeding needle, which was then tied in
place. The lungs were lavaged with 7 mL of physiological saline freely
flowingfrom30 cmabovethe ratand thisfluidwascollectedinatube
placed30 cmbelowtherat.Thislavagewasperformedtwiceand>90%
of the 14 mL of lavage fluid was recovered. After BALF sampling, the
lungs, trachea, right and left posterior mediastinal lymph nodes,
parathymic lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, and spleen of each animal
were dissected, rinsed with saline, and weighed.
2.3. Analysis
The Ti contents in the lungs after BALF sampling, BALF, trachea,
right and left posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, parathymic
lymph nodes, and liver of every animal were analyzed. The Ti
contents in the kidneys and spleen of the negative control and
highest dose groups were analyzed. In addition, the Ti contents in
the stock suspension, drinking water, and food were also analyzed.
The lungs after BALF sampling, kidneys, and spleen were
homogenized with 2 mL of ultrapure water (Milli-Q Advantage
A10 Ultrapure Water Purification System, Merck Millipore, USA),
and the liver was homogenized with 10 mL of ultrapure water. An
electric homogenizer (PT10-35 Kinematica AG and NS-50; 
Micro-tec Co. Ltd., Japan) was used and the resulting homogenates were
stored at <30 C until analysis.
All samples were treated with acid prior to determination of Ti
levels. Nitric acid (HNO3; 68%, 0.5 mL) and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2; 35%, 0.2 mL) were added to 0.1 mL of BALF, HNO3 (1 mL), and
sulfuric acid (H2SO4; 98%, 0.2 mL) were added to 1 g of 
homogenized tissues, HNO3 (0.5 mL) and H2SO4 (0.1 mL) were added to
whole lymph node samples, HNO3 (1 mL) and H2O2 (0.3 mL) were
added to 0.02 g of animal feed, and H2SO4 (0.5 mL) and hydrofluoric
acid (HF; 38%, 0.5 mL) were added to 20 mL and 100 mL for high and
low concentrations of the administered TiO2 suspension, 
respectively. Drinking water was diluted 10-fold with 10% HNO3 solution,

with no subsequent handling. All acids used in the present study
were ultrapure grade reagents (TAMAPURE-AA-100, Tama 
Chemicals Co., Ltd., Japan). The acidified samples (apart from drinking
water) were placed in a 7 mL perfluoroalkylvinylether vessel,
which was inserted into a 100 mL digestion vessel of a microwave
sample preparation instrument (ETHOS 1; Milestone Srl Italy or
Speedwave 4; Berghof, Germany), and they were heated to 180 C
for 20 min or 200 C for 20 min. After cooling to 40 C, the 
acid-treated samples, with the exception of the TiO2 nanoparticle
suspensions, were diluted to 5 mL (BALF and lymph nodes) or
10 mL (the other organs and feed) with ultrapure water (made by
PURELAB Option-R 7 and PURELAB Flex UV from Veolia Water
Solutions and Technologies, France). Samples of the acid-treated
TiO2 nanoparticle suspensions were heated on a hotplate for
approximately 2 h until white fuming sulfuric acid was generated.
After cooling, the solution was diluted to 50 mL with 10% HNO3.
The sample Ti contents were then determined by ICP-SFMS using
a Finnigan ELEMENT II (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. , Germany), and
the Ti content in the administered TiO2 nanoparticle suspensions

was determined by ICP atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES;
SPS4000, SII NanoTechnology Inc., Japan). For ICP-SFMS, RF power
was 1250 W, cool gas flow rate was 16 L/min, auxiliary gas flow rate
was 0.87 L/min, sample gas flow rate was 0.870-0.965 L/min,
additional gas flow rate was 0.080-0.180 L/min, mass resolution
[/ day ]
(R) was 4000, and the measured mass number m/z was 49. For 
ICP-AES, RF power was 1.3 kW, plasma gas flow rate was 16 L/min,
additional gas flow rate was 0.5 L/min, carrier gas flow rate was
1.0 L/min, and wavelength was 334.941 nm. In the present study,
49Ti (mass: 48.9479) was analyzed because its spectrum could be
separated from the spectra of 33S16O (mass: 48.9666), 31P18O (mass:
48.9729), and 32S16O1H (mass: 48.9748). Linearity of the calibration
curves for 49Ti using ICP-SFMS was good between 0 and 20 ng/mL of
standard solution (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL;
R2 > 0.999). Quality assurance data for the analysis were as
previously described (Shinohara et al., 2014).
2.4. TiO2 clearance analysis using decay model fitting
Both 1-compartment and 2-compartment models were
employed in this study. The 1-compartment model assumed one
clearance pathway from the lungs (Fig. 1). For the 2-compartment
approach, two kinds of clearance pathway models were 
considered. Model A (Fig. 2A) assumed, direct clearance from the
compartment 1, translocation from compartment 1 to 2, and
clearance via compartment 2, while model B (Fig. 2B) assumed
clearance from compartment 1 only, and reciprocal translocation
between compartments 1 and 2.
The 1-compartment model can be represented by a 1-step
clearance rate constant, as shown in Eq. (1), where B was the TiO2
lung burden; A was the amount of TiO2 administered (mg); t was
the time elapsed after administration (day); r was the fraction of
the administered TiO2 that reached the alveolar region; and k was
the clearance rate constant for the clearance (/day).

in lung compartment 1 (mg); B2 was the TiO2 burden in lung
compartment 2 (mg); A was the amount of TiO2 administered (mg);
r was the fraction of the administered TiO2 that reached the alveolar
region; and k1, k12, and k2were the rate constants for clearance from
compartment 1 (/day), translocation from compartment 1 to 2
(/day), and clearance from compartment 2 (/day), respectively.

The 2-compartment model B can be represented by a clearance

The clearance/translocation rate constants, k, k1, k12, k2, and, k21
and the fraction of the administered TiO2 that reached the alveolar
region, r, of each model were estimated by fitting the decay curve
to the total TiO2 burden measured in the lungs including BALF.
Curve fitting was conducted using a least squares approach, in
which the following sum of square difference in the logarithmic
converted lung burden between the measured lung burden
(Bmeasured), and the estimated lung burden (B1 + B2) was minimized
(Eq. (6)), using the Solver tool in Excel 2010.

2.5. TiO2 translocation rate coefficients to thoracic lymph nodes
The rate constants for translocation of TiO2 from lung to thoracic
lymph nodes were estimated under the following two assumptions,
applied to the 2-compartment models A and B. One assumption was
that TiO2 translocated from compartment 1 to the thoracic lymph
nodes (Eq. (7)) and the other assumption was that TiO2 translocated
from compartment 2 to the thoracic lymph nodes (Eq. (8)).

2.6. Statistical analysis
The differences in tissue Ti or TiO2 concentrations between the
study groups were statistically analyzed by Student’s t test or 
one-way ANOVA (Welch’s test) after F-testing using SPSS 20.0.
3. Results
3.1. TiO2 nanoparticle characteristics
The Z-average particle sizes were 143-148 nm in the 
administered suspensions, with z potentials of 44 mV. Fig. 3 shows the
TiO2 nanoparticle size distribution and a scanning electron
micrograph of the nanoparticle in the stock suspension. The
specific surface area of TiO2 nanoparticles in the administered
suspension was 59 m2/g, which was very similar to that of the
primary particles (50  15 m2/g, catalog value).
3.2. Ti content in the dosing suspensions, drinking water, and rat feed
The TiO2 concentrations in the diluted suspensions, determined
by ICP-AES, were >95% of the concentration estimated by weight
measurement and accounting for the dilution factor. Thus, the
concentration of the stock solution was confirmed. The 
concentrations of Ti in drinking water and feed, determined by ICP-SFMS,
were <0.10 ng/mL and 2700 ng/g, respectively. This corresponded
to TiO2-equivalent concentrations of <0.17 ng/mL and 4500 ng/g,
respectively.

nanoparticles were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those of
the control group (Fig. 4). The rat TiO2 burden depended on the
dose administered. TiO2 burdens in lung after BALF sampling and
BALF decreased over time. One day after administration,
58%  16%, 70%  15%, 78%  13%, 64%  15%, and 77%  15% of
the TiO2 administered was present in the lungs after BALF
sampling of rats dosed with 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg,
respectively, while 6.1%  1.7%, 6.5%  0.75%, 8.6%  1.7%,
13%  3.4%, and 31%  4.9% of administered TiO2 was present in
the lungs after BALF sampling 26 weeks after administration of
0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively. Much less TiO2
was detected in BALF or trachea following intratracheal 
administration of TiO2 nanoparticles. In BALF, 3.7%  0.49%, 4.6%  1.4%,
4.9%  1.6%, 4.8%  1.8%, and 3.5%  0.90% of the TiO2 administered
was present 1 day after administration of 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and
6.0 mg/kg, respectively, as compared with 0.43%  0.14%,
0.31%  0.11%, 0.31%  0.14%, 0.28%  0.13%, and 0.26%  0.031%
detected in BALF 26 weeks after administration. In trachea,
1.3%  0.60%, 1.2%  0.26%, 1.0%  0.41%, 0.81%  0.35%, and
0.84%  0.45% of 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg TiO2,
respectively, was present 1 day after administration, as compared
to 1.1%  0.85%, 0.60%  0.32%, 0.98%  0.78%, 0.50%  0.22%, and
0.31%  0.27% in the trachea at 26 weeks after administration.
TiO2 burdens in the thoracic lymph nodes are shown in Fig. 5.
The TiO2 burdens in most of the thoracic lymph nodes were
significantly higher in the groups dosed with TiO2 nanoparticles,
compared with the control group, and increased over time. The
total thoracic lymph node burden (right and left posterior
mediastinal lymph nodes, and parathymic lymph nodes) ranged
from 0.0089-0.040% of the dose administered 1 day after
intratracheal administration. The TiO2 burden in thoracic lymph
nodes showed dose-dependency 26 weeks after administration,

3.4%  1.2% for the doses of 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg,
respectively.
TiO2 burdens in liver are shown in Fig. 6. The liver TiO2 burden
was significantly elevated above control levels only in the animals
administered 6.0 mg/kg at 3 days to 26 weeks after the
administration (P < 0.01). In these groups, the liver TiO2 burden
was 0.0023%  0.0013%, 0.0094%  0.0073%, 0.0028%  0.00056%,
0.012%  0.0053%, and 0.0087%  0.0025% of the dose 
administered at 3 days, 7 days, 4 weeks, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks after
administration, respectively. No significant differences were
observed in kidney and spleen TiO2 levels in animals treated
with the higher dose of nanoparticles and in control animals.
3.4. TiO2 clearance analysis using compartment models
The 2-compartment models were found to provide a better
description of the pulmonary TiO2 burden decay curves than the
1-compartment model, as shown in Fig. 7. The sum of square
difference was 0.006-0.07 for the 2-compartment models A and B
and 0.07-0.2 for the 1-compartment model. Since fitting results
did not differ significantly between the 2-compartment models A
and B, we have mainly shown the results of 2-compartment model
A below. The estimated fraction of the administered TiO2 that
reached the alveolar region and clearance/translocation rate
constants based on the 1- compartment model and
2-compartment model A are shown in Table 1. The clearance rate

constants estimated by the 1-compartment model were stable
(0.012-0.013/day) between the doses of 0.375 and 1.5 mg/kg, and
decreased to 0.0097 and 0.0055/day at doses of 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg,
respectively. In the 2-compartment model, the clearance rate
constants from compartment 1, k1, estimated using model A
decreased from 0.030 (0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg) to 0.014 and
0.016/day (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) with increasing TiO2 dose. The
translocation rate constants from compartment 1 to 2, k12,
estimated for doses of 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg, 0.015 and
0.018/day, were higher than those for doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg,
0.0025-0.0092/day. The clearance rate constants from 
compartment 2, k2, were also higher for doses of 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg,
0.0086 and 0.0093/day, than those for doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg,
0-0.00082/day.
3.5. TiO2 translocation rate coefficients to thoracic lymph nodes
Measured and estimatedTiO2burden in thoracic lymph nodesare
shown in Fig. 8. The sum of square differences indicated that the
estimated thoracic lymph node burdens were a much better fit to the
measured burdens when TiO2 translocation from compartment 1 to
the thoracic lymph nodes was assumed, rather than those where
TiO2 translocation from compartment 2 to the thoracic lymph nodes
was assumed (Table 2). The sum of square difference was 0.9-3 for
the former assumption, and 20-40 for the latter assumption. The
translocation rate coefficients from the lungs to the thoracic lymph
nodes (kLung!Lym) estimated under the former assumption,
increased depending on the TiO2 dose, with kLung!Lym of
0.000037-0.00012/day for doses of 0.375-1.5 mg/kg to
0.00035 and 0.00081/day for doses of 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg,
respectively.
4. Discussion
In the results of 2-compartment model fitting, the fraction of
the administered TiO2, that reached to alveolar region which does
not include the bronchi and bronchiole, was estimated to be
74-82%, and this was not dose-dependent. Approximately 20% of
the administered dose was considered not to have reached to the
alveolar region, but to be trapped in the bronchi and bronchioles,
from where it was subsequently excreted by the bronchial
mucociliary escalator.
In this study, a certain fraction of the TiO2 nanoparticles
(0.4-1.5%) was stably detected in the trachea at 1 day to 26 weeks
after intratracheal administration; this fraction was not 
dose-dependent. Particles deposited on the bronchi and bronchioles can
be cleared by the bronchial mucociliary escalator within 5 min
because the bronchial length (throat to terminal bronchiole) in rats is
approximately 53 mm (Yeh et al., 1979) and ciliary motion rates are
7.5-13.6 mm/min (Lightowler and Williams, 1969). It is probably
incorrect to assume that all of the TiO2 detected in the trachea in the
present study (0.4-1.5% of the administration dose) was in the
process of being cleared from the alveoli by the bronchial
mucociliaryescalator, asthiswould leadtothe unrealisticconclusion
thatall of the administeredTiO2could beclearedvia thisroutewithin
1 day. Some TiO2 particles might be retained in the trachea until at
least 26 weeks after the administration.
In the present study, lavagable fractions of TiO2 nanoparticle in
lung (BALF/(lung + BALF)) were 4.4-7.0% 1 day after administration
and 0.84-6.5% 26 weeks after administration. Although the
lavagable fraction was constant at lower doses (6.1% and 6.2% at
1 day to 6.5% and 4.6% at 26 weeks after administration for 0.375
and 0.75 mg/kg), it decreased at higher doses (4.4-7.0% at 1 day to
0.84-3.5% at 26 weeks after administration for 1.5-6.0 mg/kg). At
higher doses, this low fraction could be associated with delayed
clearance from lung. Previous studies indicated that the lavagable
fraction of ultrafine TiO2 particles in lung corresponded to 69%,
which was calculated using the tissue fraction (15.4%) and the
equation (Tissue fraction = 1 1.23  lavaged fraction), 1 day after
intratracheal administration of approximately 2.3 mg/kg (0.5 mg/
rat) (Oberdörster et al., 1992) and 19% 7 days after intratracheal
administration of approximately 2 mg/kg (0.52 mg/rat) (Sager et al.,
2008). In the present study, 6.0% and 7.0% of the administered TiO2
nanoparticles were lavaged 1 day after administration of 1.5 and
3.0 mg/kg, respectively, and 6.3% and 3.8% 7 days after 
administration of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg. Therefore, comparing similar doses and
observation timings, the fractions in the present study were smaller
than those reported previously. In these three studies, the animals
were of the same strain and sex (Fisher F344 rat; male) and their
body weight were similar (220 g in Oberdörster et al. (1992),
200-300 g in Sager et al. (2008); and 215-273 g in our study). The
primary sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles were also similar among the
three studies: 20 nm in Oberdörster et al. (1992) and 21 nm in
Sager et al. (2008) and in our study. However, BALF was sampled
using 2  7 mL washes with saline in the present study, compared to
10  5 mL washes (Oberdörster et al., 1992) or 2  6 mL washes
followed by several 8 mL washes, up to a total of 80 mL (Sager et al.,
2008). This was consistent with our observation of fewer 
macrophages and neutrophils in BALF, compared to those reported in
previous studies (Table S1) (Oberdörster et al., 1992; Sager et al.,
2008). Therefore, the smaller fraction in the present study could be
due to the milder BALF sampling.
The lavagable fraction in the present study could be either the
particles internalized in the lavagable alveolar macrophages
and/or the free particles in the airspaces. Oberdörster et al. (1992)
considered that 1.23 times the lavagable fraction is retained in the
alveolar space and the rest is located in the tissue. Sager et al.
(2008) considered the lavagable fraction as the particles
internalized by lavagable alveolar macrophages or presenting
as free particles in the airspaces. Since BALF sampling was milder
in our study than in the previous studies, the number of particles
in lavagable macrophages and/or free particles in the air space
might be larger than the lavagable fraction obtained in the
present study.
In previous studies, after inhalation exposure to TiO2 
nanoparticles, TiO2 was only detected in the lungs and lung-associated
lymph nodes, and was below the detection limit of <500 ng/organ
in other organs (Bermudez et al., 2004; Ma-Hock et al., 2009; van
Ravenzwaay et al., 2009). The present study used highly sensitive
analytical methods and the detection limit improved to permit
detection of considerably lower levels of tissue TiO2 (detection
limits: 30 ng/organ in lung; 1.0 ng/organ in trachea; 0.5 ng/organ in
lymph nodes; 14 ng/organ in liver), enabling determination of TiO2
10 N. Shinohara et al. / Toxicology 325 (2014) 1-11
distribution for organs where TiO2 content could not be 
determined in previous studies. This identified a liver TiO2 burden of
34-180 ng/organ (0.0023-0.012%) from 3 days to 26 weeks after
administration of 6.0 mg/kg, which was significantly higher than
the level detected in the control group (9.8-27 ng/organ), and
which would have been below the limit of detection
(500 ng/organ) in the previous studies. This suggested that some
pulmonary TiO2 nanoparticles could translocate to the liver via the
blood. Although TiO2 nanoparticles might translocate from lung to
liver at 0.375-3.0 mg/kg, we could not observe significant results
because of the variance in the negative control. Since >90% of
intravenously injected TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles translocated to the
liver within 1 day and were rarely cleared from it, even after 30
days (Shinohara et al., 2014), the burden detected in liver could be
considered to represent translocation from the lung to blood and it
is possible that translocation from the lung to other organs (apart
from the liver) was negligible. In the present study, spleen and
kidney TiO2 levels did not differ between the groups administered
TiO2 nanoparticles and the control group.
Delayed pulmonary clearance of TiO2 nanoparticles was found
at higher doses, a phenomenon that is termed overload. Using the
1-compartment model, the clearance rate constant, k, did not vary
at doses of between 0.375 and 1.5 mg/kg, and decreased at 3.0 and
6.0 mg/kg. This result was consistent with the findings of a
12-month observation study after intratracheal instillation
(Oyabu et al., 2013), where pulmonary clearance of
intratracheally-administered TiO2 nanoparticles was observed to
be delayed at high doses of 3.3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, compared
with those observed at low doses of 0.33 mg/kg and 0.66 mg/kg,
using the 1-compartment model.
The present study found that 3.4%  1.2% of the 6.0 mg/kg TiO2
nanoparticle dose had translocated to thoracic lymph nodes by
26 weeks after administration. Translocation to thoracic lymph
nodes similarly increased over time after inhalation exposure in
previous studies (Bermudez et al., 2004). In the present study,
translocation to thoracic lymph nodes was estimated to occur from
compartment 1 according tothe comparison ofcurve fittingbetween
2 assumptions. The dose-dependent increase observed in kLung!Lym
in the present study suggested that the translocation to thoracic
lymph nodes was enhanced at higher nanoparticle doses unlike
pulmonary clearance. Therefore, pulmonary overload was 
considered not to be associated with the thoracic lymph node clearance
route. Since the translocation rate constants (kLung!Lym) were
independently estimated for given burdens in compartments 1 and
2 (B1 and B2) estimated with the 2-compartment model, the
translocation rate constants, kLung!Lym, could be considered to be
the part of the clearance rate constants from compartment 1, k1.
Although the ratio of kLung!Lym to k1 showed a dose-dependent
increase (0.4% at 0.375 mg/kg to 5% at 6.0 mg/kg), most clearance
from lung could occur via other routes, such as the bronchial
mucociliary escalator. In the previous compartmental models for
pulmonary clearance, compartments 1 and 2 were considered to be
the alveolar surface and the interstitium, respectively, and the
clearance pathways from compartment 1 and 2 were considered to
be the bronchial mucociliary escalator via the bronchi, and
translocation to lung-associated lymph nodes via the interstitium,
respectively (Stöber, 1999; Kuempel et al., 2001). In the present
study, however, it was suggested that clearances both by the
bronchial mucociliary escalator via the bronchi after macrophage
phagocytosis and translocation to the thoracic lymph nodes should
be described as clearance from compartment 1. Therefore, it is
better to consider compartment 2 as a lung compartment where
particle accumulate, rather than as an intermediate compartment
for slow particle clearance. Compartment 2 might correspond to
macrophages which have phagocytosed TiO2 nanoparticles and
have subsequently been sequestered within the interstitium.
Measured pulmonary burden can be well modeled effectively
using the classical 2-compartment model in the present study.
The advantage of the classical model in the present study over the
previous physiologically based models is that it eliminates the
arbitrariness and uncertainty in deciding the clearance mechanism
and compartment meanings because the clearance mechanism
and compartment meanings do not have to be predicted in
advance. On the other hand, the disadvantage of the current model
is that the meaning of the compartments is assumed only on the
basis of circumstantial evidence. In addition, fitting of the results
could be unclear if there is only a small amount of data.
In the results of 2-compartment model fitting, the k1
(0.014-0.030/day, equivalent half-life: 23-48 days) was higher
than the k12 (0.0025-0.018/day, equivalent half-life: 39-280 days),
and the k2 (0-0.0093/day, equivalent half-life: 75->840 days)
(Table 1B). The rate constants for clearance from compartment 1, k1,
and translocation from compartments 1 to 2, k12, were lower at
doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg than at doses of 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg. The
rate constants for clearance from compartment 2, k2, (or transfer
rate constants from compartment 2 to 1, k21) were much lower at
doses of 1.5-6.0 mg/kg than at doses of 0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg. One of
possible mechanism that could explain these dose-dependencies
would be follows. Both clearance via the bronchial mucociliary
escalator, and the sequestration of macrophages that have ingested
TiO2, showed dose-dependent reductions. In addition, small
amounts of TiO2 nanoparticle in the sequestrum macrophages
could be cleared, or the macrophages could become 
non-sequestrum, at lower nanoparticle doses. However, at higher TiO2
nanoparticle doses, almost no TiO2 nanoparticles could be cleared
from the sequestrum macrophages and they could not be cleared
from the sequestrum macrophages or they could not become 
non-sequestrum.
5. Conclusion
In the present study, the tissue distribution and clearance of
TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) were determined after intratracheal
administration to rats, using highly sensitive analytical methods.
By 26 weeks after administration, the lung TiO2 burden including
BALF had decreased to 6.6-8.9% of the 0.375-1.5 mg/kg doses and
to 13% and 31% of the 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg doses. At higher doses,
pulmonary clearance was inhibited. The pulmonary clearance rate
constants k1, k12, and k2, estimated to be 0.014-0.030,
0.0025-0.018, and 0.0000-0.0093/day using a 2-compartment
model, decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The translocation
rate constants from lung to thoracic lymph nodes, kLung!Lym,
estimated to be 0.000037-0.00081/day, were much lower than
these pulmonary clearance rate constants and increased in a 
dose-dependent manner.
