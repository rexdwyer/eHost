Abstract: Tomato is a globally famous food and contains several phytonutrients including lycopene,
β-carotene, anthocyanin, and flavonoids. The increased temperature used to produce tomato juice,
ketchup, tomato paste and canned tomato enhances the bioactive composition. We aimed to verify
the beneficial effects of processed tomato juice from Kagome Ltd. (KOT) on hypolipidemic action in
hamsters with hyperlipidemia induced by a 0.2% cholesterol and 10% lard diet (i.e., high-cholesterol
diet (HCD)). Male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly divided into two groups for treatment:
normal (n = 8), standard diet (control); and experimental (n = 32), HCD. The 32 hamsters were further
divided into four groups (n = 8 per group) to receive vehicle or KOT by oral gavage at 2787, 5573,
or 13,934 mg/kg/day for six weeks, designated the HCD-1X, -2X and -5X groups, respectively. The
efficacy and safety of KOT supplementation was evaluated by lipid profiles of serum, liver and feces
and by clinical biochemistry and histopathology. HCD significantly increased serum levels of total
cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, hepatic and fetal TC and TG levels, and degree
of fatty liver as compared with controls. KOT supplementation dose-dependently decreased serum
TC, TG, LDL-C levels, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, hepatic TC and TG levels, and fecal TG level. Our study
provides experiment-based evidence to support that KOT may be useful in treating or preventing the
onset of hyperlipidemia.

1. Introduction
Tomato is low in fat and calories, cholesterol free, and a good source of fiber and protein. It is
also rich in vitamins A and C, β-carotene, potassium, and lycopene [1]. Tomato is now used in
enormous quantities in the fresh state and heads the list of all vegetables as a canned product. Most
tomato is consumed as a processed product, such as pastes, concentrates, ketchup, salsa and juice.
Processed tomato products are important sources of minerals and vitamins in diets [2]. Tomato and
processed tomato contain many health-benefit components, such as lycopene, anthocyanin, ascorbic
acid, total phenolics, glycoalkaloids, and tomatine and low levels of carotenoids [3-8]. Lycopene
bioavailability can be affected by food processing. The bioavailability in food is higher for cis-isomers

Nutrients 2015, 7, 10525-10537
than all-trans-isomers. Lycopene bioavailability is higher in processed tomato products than in
unprocessed fresh tomatoes [9-11].
tomatoes are usually boiled first to inactivate enzymes that decrease vitamin C and other nutrients
when tomatoes are crushed. Some foods lose their nutrient content when they are cooked or juiced,
but the heating process actually boosts certain of tomatoes’ properties. Lycopene is more available in
tomato juice than in fresh tomatoes because of the heat and oil used to produce juice. Canned and
bottled tomato juice is often fortified, thereby increasing the levels of vitamins [12,13]. In a previous
study, the US Department of Agriculture recorded that 1/2 cup of tomato juice provides 10% and 35%
of the recommended daily amount of vitamins C and A, respectively [14].
Tomato juice is known to have lipid-lowering effects and antioxidant activities [11]. In previous
study, a tomato processed product improved blood lipid profiles in postmenopausal hyperlipidemic
rats [10]. A high dietary intake of tomato products has atheroprotective effects by significantly reducing
liver and serum cholesterol levels [15,16]. Tomato from the processing of tomato products contains
many bioactive components, including those that act as antioxidants, such as the vitamins C and E and
carotenoids. Lycopene is one of the main carotenoids in tomatoes. Previous study demonstrated that
lycopene shows greater stability at low than high temperature and benefits from the processed tomato
products. The lycopene bioactivity can be more accurately predicted in processed tomato than fresh
tomato because lycopene is more soluble in lipids than water and has greater interaction with cellulose.
Therefore, grinding tomato and cooking with oil could increase the bioavailability [17-19]. Another
study showed that a higher lycopene concentration could protect against cardiovascular disease [20];
tomato-processed foods contain lycopene that can help reduce serum triglyceride (TG) levels with
human high fat-induced [21-23]. One recent study reported that 13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid in
tomato extract acts as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist and ameliorates
obesity-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis [24].
Many studies used the hamster model to evaluate the hypolipidemic effect because it has
many similarities with human fat-induced atherosclerotic disease. Similar to humans, hamsters
are endowed with cholesterol ester transfer protein and all of the enzymatic pathways in lipoproteins
and bile metabolism; atherosclerotic plaques develop in response to a fat diet in lesion-prone areas
similar to humans [25-27]. Therefore, we used hamsters to evaluate the preventive effectiveness
of supplementation with tomato juice from Kagome Ltd. (KOT) that is produced by a process for
increasing lycopene and dietary fiber on hyperlipidemia regulation. We also examined the biochemical
parameters and liver tissues by histopathology.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Materials, Animals, and Experiment Design
KOT was obtained from Taiwan Kagome Co. (Tainan, Taiwan). In this study, the dose of KOT
designed for humans was 22.595 g per day (lyophilized powder), which would be equivalent to a daily
recommended dose of KOT at 280 mL/serving/day. To ensure precise and accurate dosing of test
animals, KOT was lyophilized by freeze-drying to obtain powder extract. The nutrition facts, dietary
fiber and lycopene of KOT were provided by Kagome Co. and are shown in Table 1. The hamster dose
(2787 mg/kg) we used was converted from a human-equivalent dose (HED) based on body surface
area by the following formula from the US Food and Drug Administration: assuming a human weight
of 60 kg, the HED for 22.595 (g)/60 (kg) = 377 ˆ 7.4 = 2787 mg/kg; the conversion coefficient 7.4 was
used to account for differences in body surface area between hamsters and human as we recently
described [28].
Tomato juice is made by heating, crushing and simmering tomatoes. To maintain nutrition,

2.2. HCD Composition
Hamsters were fed a standard chow diet or an HCD adapted from our previous study [29]. The
standard chow (No. 5001) contained 3.35 kcal/g with 28.5% as protein, 13.5% as fat and 58.0% as

carbohydrates. The HCD contained 0.2% (wt/wt) cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
10% (wt/wt) lard (Sigma-Aldrich) and 89.8% (wt/wt) standard chow, for 3.92 kcal/g with 21.96% as
protein, 33.37% as fat and 44.67% as carbohydrates.
2.3. Clinical Biochemical Profiles
At the end of the experiment, after 12 h of food deprivation all hamsters were anaesthetized with
5% isoflurane at the rate of 0.5 L/min and euthanized by exsanguination after 12 h of food deprivation.
Blood samples were collected from abdominal aortas. Serum was collected by centrifugation at 1500ˆ g
for 15 min and the clinical biochemical variables including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
creatinine, and glucose were measured by using the Beckman DxC 800 analyzer (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA, USA). Hamsters were sacrificed after 6 weeks of KOT supplementation; liver, kidney, heart
and epididymal fat pad (EFP) were removed and tissue weight was recorded for evaluating body
composition. All tissue samples were snap-frozen and stored at ´80 ˝C until further analysis.
2.4. Liver and Fecal Lipid Analysis
We used a metabolic cage (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo) to collect hamster feces for analysis of
fecal TG and total cholesterol (TC) levels. Fecal lipids were extracted by using chloroform-methanol
(2:1, v/v) with a Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Cambridge, MA, USA). The suspension was filtered
through Whatman No. 5 filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), and the solvent was aspirated,
and evaporated. The residue was resuspended in 1 mL of DMSO solution. Fecal TG and TC levels
were measured colorimetrically as described previously. Hepatic TG and TC were extracted by
chloroform-isopropanol-NP40 (7:11:0.1, v/v) with a Bullet Blender. After centrifugation (12,000ˆ g;
10 min), TG and TC levels were quantified by using a commercial enzymatic kit for TG (No. 10010303)
and a kit for TC (No. 10007640) from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
2.5. Histological Staining of Tissues
Liver tissues were carefully removed, minced and fixed in 10% formalin. All samples were
embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-µm thick slices for morphological and pathological evaluations.
Tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under a light microscope
equipped with a CCD camera (BX-51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by a veterinary pathologist.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean ˘ SD (standard deviation). Statistical differences were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend analysis of
dose-effect of KOT supplementation with use of SAS 9.0 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC, USA). p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Hamster BW and Daily Intake
The growth curves for hamsters are in Figure 2. At the start of the experiment, the BW of the
five groups did not significantly differ (Table 2). During the experimental period, BW was stable and
steadily increased in each group. At the end of the experiment, the BW did not differ among the
groups. Therefore, the HCD did not affect BW. With KOT supplementation, the BW curve was still
stable and steadily increased, with no significant differences among groups. The daily intake is shown
in Table 2. The diet intake did not differ among the groups, but water intake significantly decreased in
HCD-induced hyperlipidemia groups (HCD, KOT-1X, -2X and -5X) as compared with controls. This
result was same as for our previous study; hamsters fed an HCD to induce hyperlipidemia showed

LDL-C is generated by lipolysis of VLDL-C. The function of LDL-C is to deliver cholesterol to
cells, where it is used in membranes or for the synthesis of steroid hormones [31-33]. Additionally,
increased concentrations of LDL-C are strongly associated with increased atherosclerosis, because LDL
becoming oxidized LDL inhibits macrophage migration and promotes lipid uptake by macrophages,
which become foam cells that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques [34,35]. Thus, the level of LDL-C
is linked to atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular consequences [36,37]. In our study, KOT could have
modulatory effects on LDL-C levels and show health benefits with specific ingredients that have a
pharmacological effect on hyperlipidemia. A previous study demonstrated that tomatine, a major

3.3. Effect of Six-Week KOT Supplementation on Hepatic TG and TC Levels in Hyperlipidemic Hamsters
At the end of the experiment, liver TG content was 80.6 ˘ 6, 112 ˘ 10, 96 ˘ 7, 78 ˘ 7 and

by 14.8% (p = 0.0007), 30.2% (p < 0.0001) and 33.8% (p < 0.0001) for KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups,
respectively, than with HCD alone. On trend analysis, liver TG content was dose-dependently
decreased with KOT supplementation under HCD-induced hyperlipidemia (p < 0.0001). Furthermore,
liver TC content was 3.51 ˘ 0.49, 11.46 ˘ 0.41, 9.22 ˘ 1.15, 6.64 ˘ 0.96 and 7.78 ˘ 1.07 (mg/g
liver) for control, HCD, KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups, respectively (Figure 4B), and was higher, by
3.27-fold (p < 0.001), with HCD alone than for controls. Liver TC content was lower, by 19.6%
(p < 0.0001), 42.0% (p < 0.0001) and 32.1% (p < 0.0001) for KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups, respectively,
than with HCD alone. On trend analysis, liver TC content was dose-dependently decreased with KOT
supplementation (p = 0.0001). Accumulation of liver fat is often associated with abnormal accumulation
of TGs in liver [41]. Therefore, KOT supplementation could significantly mitigate the increased liver
TC and TG content induced by the HCD hyperlipidemia model. One recent study demonstrated that
9-oxo-10(E),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid in tomato extract promotes fatty acid metabolism via
PPARα activation in liver cells and has potential for use in the management of dyslipidemia [42].
In addition, 13-oxo-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid in the extract of tomato induced PPARγ
expression in adipose tissue and resulted in the regulation of adipogenesis [43]. From these previous
studies, we suggest that KOT may activate PPARα and PPARγ by two different pathways to reduce TG
level and increase insulin sensitization; there were activation of PPARα reduces triglyceride level and
is involved in regulation of energy homeostasis and activation of PPARγ causes insulin sensitization

3.4. Effect of Six-Week Supplementation with KOT on Fecal TG and TC Levels in Hyperlipidemic Hamsters
and TC levels. At the end of the experiment, the fecal TG content was 17.7 ˘ 3.4, 22.5 ˘ 6.2, 20.0 ˘ 4.2,
19.2 ˘ 5.0 and 17.8 ˘ 3.2 (mg/g feces) in control, HCD, KOT-1X, KOT-2X and KOT-5X, respectively
(Figure 5A). The fecal TG content of the HCD group was significantly higher, by 1.27-fold (p = 0.0415),
as compared with the control. The fecal TG content was decreased by 20.9% (p = 0.044) with KOT-5X
than with HCD alone. On trend analysis, KOT supplementation dose-dependently decreased fecal TG
content under HCD-induced hyperlipidemia (p = 0.0406). Fecal TC content was 2.28 ˘ 0.51, 2.92 ˘ 0.46,
4.12 ˘ 0.69, 3.70 ˘ 0.49 and 3.58 ˘ 0.59 (mg/g feces) for control, HCD, KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups,
respectively (Figure 5B), and was higher, by 1.28-fold (p = 0.0273), with HCD alone than for controls.
Furthermore, fecal TC content was higher, by 1.41-fold (p = 0.0001), 1.27-fold (p = 0.0078) and 1.23-fold
(p = 0.0224), for KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups, respectively, than with HCD alone. Therefore, our
HCD could increase both fecal TG and TC content. KOT treatment could reduce excessive fecal TG
levels and increase fecal TC level excretion. A previous study demonstrated that tomatine decreased
serum LDL-C level via formation of a tomatine-cholesterol complex, which was subsequently excreted
in feces. Alternatively, the TG and TC content may be reduced by a diet rich in fiber, which may
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by several mechanisms. Many studies showed significantly
reduced cholesterol level associated with dietary fiber intake and cholesterol exerted by feces [44]. We
previously showed that viscous flaxseed dietary fibers may be useful for lowering blood cholesterol
level than fibers in the solid state [45]. KOT, in accordance with the intervention, allows for decreasing
intestinal absorption of dietary lipids and also affects cholesterol homeostasis and lipid transport in

3.6. Effect of KOT Supplementation on Biochemical Analyses at the End of the Experiment
In our study, we observed the beneficial effects of KOT on indicators of lipid-lowering capacity.
We further investigated whether six-week KOT treatment had any adverse effect on other biochemical
markers in hamsters. We examined the tissue- and health status-related biochemical parameters
and liver tissues by histopathology (Table 4 and Figure 6). KOT supplementation for six weeks had
no adverse effects. Levels of biochemical indices, including albumin, total protein (TP), blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and glucose, did not differ among groups (p > 0.05, Table 4). Serum
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was higher, by 1.29-fold
(p = 0.0183) and 1.15-fold (p = 0.0224), respectively, with HCD alone than for controls. In addition,
KOT supplementation under HCD-induced hyperlipidemia could significantly decrease the serum
AST, ALT and LDH activity, respectively, as compared with HCD alone. On trend analysis, serum
AST and ALT levels were dose-dependently decreased (p = 0.0031, p = 0.0006) under HCD-induced
hyperlipidemia with KOT supplementation. Therefore, the effect of KOT on decreasing AST and ALT
activity was associated with decreased adipose tissue accumulation. The most important adverse
side effects of statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) are increased concentration of liver enzymes and
muscle problems [46]. As compared to statins, KOT did not cause liver damage. Therefore, KOT
supplementation could provide alternative nutrient supplementation to ameliorate the side effects of
statins and has a potential effect on lowering hyperlipidemia.

In our study, KOT had lipid-lowering actions by decreasing serum TG and TC levels, liver TG
and  TC  levels,  fecal  TG  levels  and  serum  LDL-C  and  LDL-C/HDL-C  levels  in  hyperlipidemic
hamsters. Six-week KOT supplementation significantly improved the hyperlipidemia syndrome in
hamsters. Hamsters showed decreased cholesterol levels in serum, and the KOT effect was exerted
via increased fecal lipid excretion. In biochemical study, we found no gross abnormalities attributed

HCD, KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups, with hepatocytes comprising microvesicles filled with small lipid
droplets, which is similar to the previous pathological observation. The degree of fatty steatosis was
significantly lower in the KOT-5X than other HCD-induced hyperlipidemic groups.
4. Conclusions
TG and TC levels, fecal TG levels and serum LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic
hamsters. Six-week KOT supplementation significantly improved the hyperlipidemia syndrome in
hamsters. Hamsters showed decreased cholesterol levels in serum, and the KOT effect was exerted
via increased fecal lipid excretion. In biochemical study, we found no gross abnormalities attributed
to KOT treatment. Thus KOT may be beneficial to human health by reducing the risk of developing
cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine
lowered serum LDL-C and cholesterol levels in hamsters and mice [38,48]. The possible mechanism
for reducing serum cholesterol level by KOT is inhibition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl-transferase
(ACAT)-1 and (ACAT)-2; ACAT-1 is located in the Kupffer cells of the liver, kidneys, and adrenal cortical
cells, an important component of cellular cholesterol homeostasis [49]. We provide experiment-based
evidence to support that KOT may have potential as a therapy for reducing blood lipid levels and
lowering hyperlipidemic effects.

After the six-week KOT supplementation, we collected all hamsters’ feces for analysis of fecal  
TG and TC levels. At the end of the experiment, the fecal TG content was 17.7 ± 3.4, 22.5 ± 6.2, 20.0 ±  
4.2, 19.2 ± 5.0 and 17.8 ± 3.2 (mg/g feces) in control, HCD, KOT-1X, KOT-2X and KOT-5X, respectively  10531 
(Figure 5A). The fecal TG content of the HCD group was significantly higher, by 1.27-fold (p = 0.0415),  
as compared with the control. The fecal TG content was decreased by 20.9% (p = 0.044) with KOT-5X  
than with HCD alone. On trend analysis, KOT supplementation dose-dependently decreased fecal  
TG content under HCD-induced hyperlipidemia (p = 0.0406). Fecal TC content was 2.28 ± 0.51, 2.92 ±  
0.46, 4.12 ± 0.69, 3.70 ± 0.49 and 3.58 ± 0.59 (mg/g feces) for control, HCD, KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups,  
respectively (Figure 5B), and was higher, by 1.28-fold (p = 0.0273), with HCD alone than for controls.  
Furthermore, fecal TC content was higher, by 1.41-fold (p = 0.0001), 1.27-fold (p = 0.0078) and 1.23- 
fold (p = 0.0224), for KOT-1X, -2X and -5X groups, respectively, than with HCD alone. Therefore, our  
HCD could increase both fecal TG and TC content. KOT treatment could reduce excessive fecal TG  
levels and increase fecal TC level excretion. A previous study demonstrated that tomatine decreased  
serum  LDL-C  level  via  formation  of  a  tomatine-cholesterol  complex,  which  was  subsequently  
excreted in feces. Alternatively, the TG and TC content may be reduced by a diet rich in fiber, which  
may  reduce  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  by  several  mechanisms.  Many  studies  showed  
significantly reduced cholesterol level associated with dietary fiber intake and cholesterol exerted by  
feces  [44]. We previously showed  that viscous  flaxseed dietary  fibers may be useful  for  lowering  
blood cholesterol level than fibers in the solid state [45]. KOT, in accordance with the intervention,  
allows for decreasing intestinal absorption of dietary lipids and also affects cholesterol homeostasis  
and lipid transport in the gut, which could explain the decreased hepatic and fecal TG levels with  
KOT supplementation.
