2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals were analytical grade unless otherwise specified. Bifenthrin (CAS no.
82657-04-3,2-methyl-1, 1-biphenyl-3-yl-methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-
dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate, 98% purity), and cis- (99% purity) and trans-permethrin
(3-phenoxybenzyl(1RS)-cis,trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-
dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, 94% purity), were purchased from ChemService (West
Chester, PA, USA) and used as analytical standards. Technical grade bifenthrin (89% purity)
(IUPAC: 2-methyl-3-phenyl-phenyl)methyl 3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-prop-1-en-yl)-2,2-
dimethyl-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate; 99% + (Z)-(1R)-cis isomer), used in dosing solutions,
was generously provided by FMC Corporation (Philadelphia, PA, USA). This grade of
bifenthrin was used in previous rat neurobehavioral studies (Weiner et al., 2009; Wolansky
et al., 2006, 2007). Labeled cis- and trans-permethrin (phenoxy-13C6) were purchased from
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA, USA) and used as internal and surrogate
standards, respectively. Solvents, including acetone, hexanes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA) and methanol (VWR, West Chester, PA, USA), were pesticide grade quality.
2.2. Animals
Male Long Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) were
obtained at 55 - 58 days of age, and housed two per cage in standard polycarbonate hanging
cages (45 cm × 24 cm × 20 cm) containing heat-sterilized pine shavings (Northeastern
Products, Inc., Warrensburg, NY, USA). All animals were given a 5-9-day acclimation
period and were maintained on a 12:12 h photoperiod (L:D, 0600:1800). Feed (Purina 5001
Lab Chow, Barnes Supply Co., Durham, NC, USA) and tap water were provided ad libitum.
Tap water (Durham, NC, USA) used in the animal facility was filtered through sand and
activated charcoal, and finally rechlorinated to 4-5 ppm Cl−. Animal holding rooms were
maintained at 22.0 ± 2.0 °C and relative humidity at 50 ± 10% in an American Association

Motor activity was measured in 16 figure-eight mazes, as modified by Wolansky et al.
(2007). Briefly, motor activity was monitored for 1 h using 16 figure-eight mazes, each
h test session. Exhaustive dose-effect studies examining eleven pyrethroids, including
calibration was checked daily prior to testing.

Committee approved all experimental protocols in advance.
Rats (n = 4 or 8/group) were exposed by gavage to vehicle (corn oil) or bifenthrin at a
volume of 1 ml/kg between 08:00 and 10:00 h. At 4 (dose = 0, 0.1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
mg/kg) or 7 h (dose = 0, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 3, 4.5, 6, 9 mg/kg) post-dosing, rats were transferred to
the testing room in individual plastic cages with pine shavings. The test room was
maintained at the same environmental conditions as the animal facility. The use of corn oil
as a vehicle and the 4- and 7-h time points were based on previous studies with bifenthrin
(Wolansky et al., 2006, 2007). The dose range chosen in this study was designed to optimize
the dose response relationships at each time point, based on pilot studies. While some of the
doses do not overlap between the two time points, two of the doses were run in both time
points.
consisting of a series of interconnected alleys (10 cm × 10 cm) converging on a central arena
and covered with transparent acrylic plastic. After 5 min of acclimation in the testing room,
rats were placed into individual mazes. Horizontal and vertical activities were detected by
eight phototransistor/photodiode pairs, equally spaced along the maze alleys at 0.5 in. above
the floor (horizontal), and four pairs located 3.0 in. above the floor in the central arena. Each
time a photobeam was interrupted, an activity count was registered (sampling rate = 1 kHz).
Total activity was calculated as the sum of horizontal and vertical activity counts over the 1

using either component of general activity (i.e., horizontal or vertical movements) as an
endpoint to describe pyrethroid actions on figure-eight maze performance. Photobeam
Blood and whole brain tissue were collected from experimental animals under deep 
CO2-induced anesthesia 20-25 min after the motor activity assay was completed. Blood (7-9 ml
total) was collected by cardiac puncture, separated into 2 ml aliquots and frozen in a
methanol/dry ice bath. Whole brains were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at −80°C until homogenized in a Spex CertiPrep 6850 freezer/mill apparatus
(Metuchen, NJ, USA). Following homogenization, samples were again flash frozen and
Aliquots of thawed blood (2 ml) and brain homogenate (300 mg) were extracted with 20:80

2.7. Residue determination
Analysis of bifenthrin and 13C6-cis- and 13C6-trans-permethrin (the internal standard and
surrogate, respectively) was performed using an Applied Biosystems API 4000
HPLC/MS/MS (Foster City, CA, USA) operated with the turbo ion spray operated at
atmospheric pressure. Positive ionization was used for all compounds and transition ion
pairs and retention times were used to verify the identities of analytes. Samples were
introduced with an isocratic 98:2 methanol:5 mM ammonium acetate mobile phase flowing
at a rate of 0.4 ml/min and separated using a Zorbax 3.5 µm 3.0 mm × 150 mm C18 column
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Bifenthrin and the surrogate trans-permethrin were quantified using a five-point calibration
curve, prepared in sample matrix, containing 13C6-cis-permethrin as an internal standard.
Residue concentrations were determined by the ratio of internal standard response to the
analyte response. Calibration standards ranged from 0.1 to 3000 ng/ml. However, curves
were generally limited to two orders of magnitude. Calibration standards were made by

added prior to extraction as a surrogate of recovery. Samples were vortexed for 10 min in 16
mm × 100 mm culture tubes with 5 ml solvent and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min.
The organic layer was collected. The extraction procedure was repeated, and both organic
fractions were combined. Bifenthrin-containing organic fractions were dried under nitrogen
and reconstituted in 1 ml hexane. Samples were then loaded onto a hexane rinsed Sep-pak
500 mg silica solid phase extraction (SPE) columns (Waters, Inc., Milford, MA, USA). SPE
columns were washed with 5 ml hexane and the bifenthrin eluted with 5 ml 94:6
hexane:ethyl acetate. Column eluants were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and
reconstituted in 1 ml 90:10 methanol:water with 25 µl of 6 µM cis-permethrin
(phenoxy-13C6) in acetone added as an internal standard of instrument efficiency for
LC/MS/MS for analysis. The solid phase cleanup was automated using a RapidTrace SPE
Workstation (Hopkinton, MA, USA).
Extraction integrity was monitored by adding trans-permethrin (phenoxy-13C6) as a
surrogate to each sample prior to extraction (see above). When recovery of the surrogate was
within 80 - 120% of the expected value was considered acceptable and required no
correction. Samples with surrogate recoveries above or below the acceptable range were
reanalyzed.

ml of methanol:water. The concentration of the lowest calibration standard was 0.1 ng/ml
that corresponded to tissue concentrations of 0.05 ng/ml and 0.3 ng/g for blood and brain,
respectively. The signal to noise ratio of this standard was approximately 20× the standard
deviation of noise in unspiked blank matrices. The lowest calibration standard was used as
the limit of quantitation. Tissue concentrations less than 0.05 ng/ml (blood) and below 0.33

different time points using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software,
San Diego California, USA, www.graphpad.com). The level of significance was set at p <
0.05. Linear regression analysis was used to compare the relationship between administered
dose and blood and brain concentrations between the 4- and 7-h groups. Potential
differences between the slopes and intercepts of these relationships between the 4- and 7-h
groups were evaluated using a t-test. A sigmoidal Emax model was used to relate motor
activity changes to administered dose or tissue concentrations and is given as:
The equation with the negative sign was used in the motor activity analysis. For this
analysis, X is the dose, E0 is the estimated motor activity when X is 0, Emax is the estimated
maximum possible decrease, b is the estimated ED50, and n is a shape parameter. When n
equals 1, the dose-response relationship is linear. When n is less than 1 the dose-response
relationship is supralinear. When n is greater than 1 the dose-response relationship becomes
threshold-like. The biologically important characteristics of this function are that it has
lower and upper extremes that are determined by the biological response independent of
dose. In the motor activity modeling exercises, E0 was constrained at less than 130 and Emax
was constrained at less than 100. Comparisons between the 4- and 7-h groups used an extra
sum of squares F-test. The sigmoidal Emax model using the positive sign was fit to the
bifenthrin blood vs. brain concentration data. In this case, E0 was set at zero, since in
unexposed animals there is no bifenthrin in either blood or brain. Data from rats with either
blood or brain bifenthrin concentrations below the level of detection were not included in
the analysis.
Bifenthrin blood:brain concentration ratios were compared using a one-way ANOVA with
dose as the independent variable for each time point. Comparison of the average blood:brain
concentration ratios between the 4- and 7-h groups was performed using a Student’s t-test.

Abstract
The potential for human exposure to pyrethroid pesticides has prompted pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic research to better characterize risk. This work tested the hypothesis that blood
and brain concentrations of the pyrethroid bifenthrin are predictive of neurotoxic effects. Adult
male Long Evans rats received a single oral dose of bifenthrin dissolved in corn oil. Using 
figure-eight mazes, motor activity was measured for 1 h at 4- and 7-h following exposure to bifenthrin
(0-16 mg/kg or 0-9 mg/kg, respectively; n = 4-8/group). Whole blood and brains were collected
immediately following motor activity assays. Bifenthrin concentrations in blood and brain were
quantified using HPLC/MS/MS. Bifenthrin exposure decreased motor activity from 20% to 70%
in a dose-dependent manner at both time points. The relationship between motor activity data and
administered dose, and blood and brain bifenthrin concentrations were described using a sigmoidal
Emax model. The relationships between motor activity and administered dose or blood
concentrations were different between the 4- and 7-h time points. The relationship between motor
activity and brain concentration was not significantly different between the two time points. These
data suggest that momentary brain concentration of bifenthrin may be a more precise dose metric

Pyrethroid insecticides are synthetic derivatives of pyrethrins, the natural insecticidal
compounds found in the chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cineraraefolum (Bradberry et al.,
2005). Pyrethroids are often classified into two groups based upon chemical structure and
neurotoxicological effect. Type I pyrethroids, which lack an alpha-cyano moiety, induce in
rats a syndrome consisting of aggressive sparring, altered sensitivity to external stimuli, and
fine tremor progressing to whole-body tremor and prostration (T-syndrome). Type II
pyrethroids, which contain an alpha-cyano moiety, produce in rats a syndrome that includes
pawing, burrowing, salivation, and coarse tremors leading to choreoathetosis (CS-syndrome)
(Verschoyle and Aldridge, 1980; Lawrence and Casida, 1982). While this classification is
useful in characterizing these chemicals, there are a few pyrethroids that elicit neurotoxic
signs of both syndromes (Verschoyle and Aldridge, 1980; Soderlund et al., 2002). In
addition, this classification is based on high dose effects and may not relate to low dose
effects of pyrethroids (Shafer et al., 2005; Soderlund et al., 2002; Wolansky and Harrill,
2008). Regardless of classification, pyrethroids primarily act by disrupting voltage gated ion
channels (Soderlund et al., 2002).
The neurotoxicity of pyrethroids appears to be due to parent compound. Induction of
neurotoxicity is rapid following intracerebral administration of pyrethroids in laboratory
animals (Lawrence and Casida, 1982; Gray and Rickard, 1982a,b). Brain concentrations of
the pyrethroid deltamethrin correlate with neurotoxic endpoints (Rickard and Brodie, 1985;
Anand et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010). Rickard and Brodie (1985) also note that direct
injection of phenoxybenzoic acid, a hydrolyzed product of deltamethrin, into rat brain was
without neurotoxic effect.
Several studies have examined the relationship between blood or brain pyrethroid
concentrations and their neurotoxic effects. In rats, the brain concentration of deltamethrin
correlates with the induction of the CS-syndrome and the T-syndrome for cismethrin and
bioresmethrin (Gray et al., 1980; Rickard and Brodie 1985; White et al., 1976). For each
pyrethroid, a chemical specific threshold level in brain was required for the neurobehavioral
effects (tremors for bioresmethrin and cismethrin, tremors and choreoathetosis for
deltamethrin) to develop. These brain concentrations were approximately 3 nmol/g for
deltamethrin, 3.5 nmol/g for cismethrin and 14.5 nmol/g for bioresmethrin. Sheets et al.
(1994) reported brain concentrations of deltamethrin were associated with a neurotoxic
response (acoustic startle response) and lethality in rats. More recently, Anand et al. (2006)
and Kim et al. (2010) correlated levels of deltamethrin in blood and brain with neurotoxic
signs measured as salivation and tremors. Overall, these data suggest that for neurotoxicity,

momentary brain concentration may be a useful dose metric for pyrethroids; however, these
studies are limited in dose-response information.
In risk assessments, using a dose metric, that quantitatively describes the relationship
between exposure, internal dose, and adverse effect can enhance the accuracy in
extrapolation across species (Gentry et al., 2002). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that
momentary pyrethroid blood and brain concentration correlates with behavioral changes.
Bifenthrin, a Type I pyrethroid, was chosen as a prototype pyrethroid. Metabolites of
pyrethroids are thought to be non-neurotoxic (Soderlund et al., 2002), therefore, blood and
brain concentrations of bifenthrin were quantified and used as dose metrics. Motor activity
was chosen as the behavioral endpoint because it is a low dose effect of Type I pyrethroids
(Wolansky and Harrill, 2008). Evaluating the relationship between tissue concentration and
behavioral effect will aid in determining if brain or blood concentrations are better
descriptors of a “biologically effective” dose than is administered dose. With this type of
data, more informative physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
models can be developed and decrease uncertainties in risk assessments of pyrethroids.

2.2. Animals
Male Long Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) were
obtained at 55 - 58 days of age, and housed two per cage in standard polycarbonate hanging
cages (45 cm × 24 cm × 20 cm) containing heat-sterilized pine shavings (Northeastern
Products, Inc., Warrensburg, NY, USA). All animals were given a 5-9-day acclimation
period and were maintained on a 12:12 h photoperiod (L:D, 0600:1800). Feed (Purina 5001
Lab Chow, Barnes Supply Co., Durham, NC, USA) and tap water were provided ad libitum.
Tap water (Durham, NC, USA) used in the animal facility was filtered through sand and
activated charcoal, and finally rechlorinated to 4-5 ppm Cl−. Animal holding rooms were
maintained at 22.0 ± 2.0 °C and relative humidity at 50 ± 10% in an American Association

Rats (n = 4 or 8/group) were exposed by gavage to vehicle (corn oil) or bifenthrin at a
volume of 1 ml/kg between 08:00 and 10:00 h. At 4 (dose = 0, 0.1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
mg/kg) or 7 h (dose = 0, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 3, 4.5, 6, 9 mg/kg) post-dosing, rats were transferred to
the testing room in individual plastic cages with pine shavings. The test room was
maintained at the same environmental conditions as the animal facility. The use of corn oil
as a vehicle and the 4- and 7-h time points were based on previous studies with bifenthrin
(Wolansky et al., 2006, 2007). The dose range chosen in this study was designed to optimize
the dose response relationships at each time point, based on pilot studies. While some of the
doses do not overlap between the two time points, two of the doses were run in both time
points.

and covered with transparent acrylic plastic. After 5 min of acclimation in the testing room,
rats were placed into individual mazes. Horizontal and vertical activities were detected by
eight phototransistor/photodiode pairs, equally spaced along the maze alleys at 0.5 in. above
the floor (horizontal), and four pairs located 3.0 in. above the floor in the central arena. Each
time a photobeam was interrupted, an activity count was registered (sampling rate = 1 kHz).
Total activity was calculated as the sum of horizontal and vertical activity counts over the 1

Blood and whole brain tissue were collected from experimental animals under deep 
CO2-induced anesthesia 20-25 min after the motor activity assay was completed. Blood (7-9 ml
total) was collected by cardiac puncture, separated into 2 ml aliquots and frozen in a
methanol/dry ice bath. Whole brains were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at −80°C until homogenized in a Spex CertiPrep 6850 freezer/mill apparatus
(Metuchen, NJ, USA). Following homogenization, samples were again flash frozen and

2.7. Residue determination
Analysis of bifenthrin and 13C6-cis- and 13C6-trans-permethrin (the internal standard and
surrogate, respectively) was performed using an Applied Biosystems API 4000
HPLC/MS/MS (Foster City, CA, USA) operated with the turbo ion spray operated at
atmospheric pressure. Positive ionization was used for all compounds and transition ion
pairs and retention times were used to verify the identities of analytes. Samples were
introduced with an isocratic 98:2 methanol:5 mM ammonium acetate mobile phase flowing
at a rate of 0.4 ml/min and separated using a Zorbax 3.5 µm 3.0 mm × 150 mm C18 column
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Bifenthrin and the surrogate trans-permethrin were quantified using a five-point calibration
curve, prepared in sample matrix, containing 13C6-cis-permethrin as an internal standard.
Residue concentrations were determined by the ratio of internal standard response to the
analyte response. Calibration standards ranged from 0.1 to 3000 ng/ml. However, curves
were generally limited to two orders of magnitude. Calibration standards were made by
ng/g (brain) were not quantified.

added prior to extraction as a surrogate of recovery. Samples were vortexed for 10 min in 16
mm × 100 mm culture tubes with 5 ml solvent and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min.
The organic layer was collected. The extraction procedure was repeated, and both organic
fractions were combined. Bifenthrin-containing organic fractions were dried under nitrogen
and reconstituted in 1 ml hexane. Samples were then loaded onto a hexane rinsed Sep-pak
500 mg silica solid phase extraction (SPE) columns (Waters, Inc., Milford, MA, USA). SPE
columns were washed with 5 ml hexane and the bifenthrin eluted with 5 ml 94:6
hexane:ethyl acetate. Column eluants were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and
reconstituted in 1 ml 90:10 methanol:water with 25 µl of 6 µM cis-permethrin
(phenoxy-13C6) in acetone added as an internal standard of instrument efficiency for
LC/MS/MS for analysis. The solid phase cleanup was automated using a RapidTrace SPE
Workstation (Hopkinton, MA, USA).
Extraction integrity was monitored by adding trans-permethrin (phenoxy-13C6) as a
surrogate to each sample prior to extraction (see above). When recovery of the surrogate was
within 80 - 120% of the expected value was considered acceptable and required no
correction. Samples with surrogate recoveries above or below the acceptable range were
reanalyzed.

different time points using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software,
San Diego California, USA, www.graphpad.com). The level of significance was set at p <
0.05. Linear regression analysis was used to compare the relationship between administered
dose and blood and brain concentrations between the 4- and 7-h groups. Potential
differences between the slopes and intercepts of these relationships between the 4- and 7-h
groups were evaluated using a t-test. A sigmoidal Emax model was used to relate motor
activity changes to administered dose or tissue concentrations and is given as:
The equation with the negative sign was used in the motor activity analysis. For this
analysis, X is the dose, E0 is the estimated motor activity when X is 0, Emax is the estimated
maximum possible decrease, b is the estimated ED50, and n is a shape parameter. When n
equals 1, the dose-response relationship is linear. When n is less than 1 the dose-response
relationship is supralinear. When n is greater than 1 the dose-response relationship becomes
threshold-like. The biologically important characteristics of this function are that it has
lower and upper extremes that are determined by the biological response independent of
dose. In the motor activity modeling exercises, E0 was constrained at less than 130 and Emax
was constrained at less than 100. Comparisons between the 4- and 7-h groups used an extra
sum of squares F-test. The sigmoidal Emax model using the positive sign was fit to the
bifenthrin blood vs. brain concentration data. In this case, E0 was set at zero, since in
unexposed animals there is no bifenthrin in either blood or brain. Data from rats with either
blood or brain bifenthrin concentrations below the level of detection were not included in
the analysis.
Bifenthrin blood:brain concentration ratios were compared using a one-way ANOVA with
dose as the independent variable for each time point. Comparison of the average blood:brain
concentration ratios between the 4- and 7-h groups was performed using a Student’s t-test.
3. Results
3.1. Exposure-dose relationships
Linear models were used to determine the relationship between administered dose (i.e.,
exposure) and tissue concentrations (i.e., internal dose) of bifenthrin. A linear model
significantly (p < 0.001) fit the administered dose vs. blood concentration data for both the
4- and 7-h time points (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The linear model underestimated the blood
concentrations in the low dose region at the 4-h time point. While a linear model fit both
time points, the slopes were significantly different between the two time points (F1,84 =
19.5; p < 0.0003). The slope of the 4-h group (24.9 ± 3.1; mean ± SE; n = 50) was
approximately 5 times greater than that of the 7-h group (4.6 ± 0.8; n = 38). A linear model
also fit the administered dose vs. brain concentrations data for both the 4- and 7-h time
points. The slope of the relationship between administered dose and brain concentrations of
bifenthrin was not significantly different (F1,85 =3.7; p = 0.058) between the 4- (32.8 ± 1.5)
and 7-h (27.9 ± 1.7) time points and a single equation fits both data sets (Table 1; Fig.
Toxicology. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 17.
Scollon et al.
Page 7
1B).Thus, the relationship between administered dose and brain concentrations of bifenthrin
is similar for both the 4-and 7-h time points.
There were no dose-dependent differences in the brain:blood ratios of bifenthrin at 4 (F7,42
= 1.8; p = 0.12) and 7 h (F6,37 = 1.35; p = 0.27) (Fig. 2A and B).The brain:blood ratio in the
7-h animals was significantly higher than the 4-h group (t-test, p<0.01), 6.0 ± 3.3 vs. 2.6 ±
1.4 (mean ± SD), respectively. The greater ratio in the 7-h group can be attributed to the
lower blood concentrations in the rats at this time point (Fig. 1A) and similar brain
concentrations at the two time points (Fig. 1B).
The relationship between bifenthrin brain and blood concentrations was evaluated using the
sigmoidal Emax model. The fits of this model to the 4- and 7-h groups were significantly
different (F3,88 = 7.6; p < 0.0001) (Table 2, Fig. 1C). The shape parameter of the model at
the 4-h time point was close to unity, suggesting a linear relationship between blood and
brain concentrations. At the 7-h time point, the shape parameter of the model was estimated
at 2.1 ± 1.1, suggesting a slight non-linear relationship between blood and brain
concentrations. These data demonstrate that the relationship between brain and blood
concentration of bifenthrin is dependent upon the time of exposure.
3.2. Target tissue dose-effect relationships
The fit of the sigmoidal Emax model to the administered dose vs. motor activity (MA) data
was significantly different (F4,84 = 3.8; p = 0.0068) between the 4- and 7-h groups (Table 3,
Fig. 3A). The difference between the two time points was in the ED50, with the 4-h time
point approximately 30 times lower than the 7-h time point (0.24 vs. 6.0, respectively). In
addition, the shape parameter of the dose-response relationship for the 4-h group was
approximately 3 times higher than that for the 7-h group, 2.0 vs. 0.6, respectively.
The relationship between bifenthrin blood concentrations and motor activity was also
significantly different for the two time points (F4,87=4.7; p = 0.0019) (Table 4; Fig. 3B). The
value of the shape parameter, n, when near unity suggests a linear relationship, while the
shape of the dose-response relationship becomes increasingly threshold-like as n increases.
The shape of the 4-h data was more threshold-like compared to the 7-h data based on the
estimated shape parameter of 3.3 vs. 0.3, respectively. These data suggest that the
relationship between bifenthrin blood concentrations and behavior is different between the
two time points.
The sigmoidal Emax model fits to the 4- and 7-h bifenthrin brain concentration vs. motor
activity data (Table 4; Fig. 3C) were not significantly different from each other (F4,90 = 2.0;
p = 0.11). Therefore, the two data sets were combined and analyzed. The sigmoidal Emax
model fit had a shape parameter of 1.47, suggesting slight non-linearity. These results
indicate that the relationship between brain concentrations of bifenthrin and behavior is
consistent between the two time points.

4. Discussion
Page 8
This study demonstrates that administered dose and blood and brain concentrations of
bifenthrin are predictors of behavioral change in rats. However, the best predictor of these
three dose metrics is bifenthrin brain concentration, in part because within the parameters of
the experiment (i.e., 4- and 7-h time points), it was independent of time of exposure. In
contrast, the relationship between administered dose and blood concentrations of bifenthrin
with motor activity are time dependent. The results suggest that momentary brain
concentration of bifenthrin is an important dose metric in the prediction of neurotoxicity in
rats and may be useful for cross-species extrapolations. Furthermore, these findings are
consistent with data from other studies (Anand et al., 2006; Gray et al., 1980; Kim et al.,
2010; Rickard and Brodie 1985; Sheets et al., 1994; White et al., 1976) in which
concentrations of parent pyrethroids were associated with behavioral effects.
In the first several hours after an oral exposure to a chemical, its concentration in blood can
change because of the dynamics of this compartment. Concentrations of chemicals in the
blood are sensitive to absorption, distribution and metabolic and renal clearance. Depending
on the volatility of the chemical, pulmonary clearance may also be an important factor.
Following the absorption and distribution phases, the concentrations of chemicals in blood is
less dynamic. In the present study, blood bifenthrin concentration was related to
administered dose in a time-dependent manner. The 4-and 7-h groups have different slopes
when administered dose was used to predict blood concentration. There was a significant
drop in blood levels, between the 4- and 7-h time points, which was likely due to the
distribution of bifenthrin into tissues and metabolic clearance of bifenthrin.
Motor activity is a measure of acute bifenthrin toxicity. In this study, bifenthrin exposure
produced a dose-dependent decrease in motor activity at both 4 and 7 h after treatment. This
is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in motor
activity in rats following acute oral doses of pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin,
permethrin, cismethrin, fenvalerate, and cyfluthrin (Crofton et al., 1995; Crofton and Reiter,
1984, 1987, 1988; Gilbert et al., 1990; McDaniel and Moser, 1993; Wolansky et al., 2006).
Bifenthrin was more potent at the 4- than at the 7-h time point and there was no difference in
the relationship between administered dose and bifenthrin brain concentrations between the
4- and 7-h time points. The relationship between brain concentration and decreased motor
activity was equivalent between the two time points and indicates that brain concentrations
are a better predictor than blood concentrations and administered dose of the acute
behavioral effects of bifenthrin.
Several studies suggest that toxicity from pyrethroids occur when central nervous system
pyrethroid concentrations exceed threshold quantities. Threshold estimates for deltamethrin
from iv exposures in rats range from 100 to 500 ng/g brain tissue (Gray and Rickard, 1981,
1982a,b). Tremors and choreoathetosis were observed in rabbits when brain levels of the
Type II pyrethroid cypermethrin reached 0.7 ng/g (Khanna et al., 2002). Type I pyrethroids
cismethrin and bioresmethrin, administered orally and iv to rats, were much less toxic,
requiring 500-1200 ng/g and 5000 ng/g, respectively, for effects to be observed (Gray et al.,
1980; Gray and Rickard, 1982a; White et al., 1976). The studies examining tissue

concentrations and behavior focused on high dose behavioral changes such as tremors,
choreoathetosis and salivation. According to the present study, brain bifenthrin
concentration corresponding to a 50% decrease in motor activity was approximately 289
ng/g (Fig. 3C). The data from the present study are consistent with earlier studies suggesting
that higher concentrations of the Type I pyrethroids are necessary to produce behavioral
toxicities than the Type II pyrethroids. However, as the sodium channel, the proposed target
of the pyrethroids (Soderlund et al., 2002), is present in the central and peripheral nervous
system, our results cannot rule out a role for an effect of bifenthrin on the peripheral nervous
system.
This study examined the relationships between exposure (oral administration), dose (tissue
concentration), and response (motor activity) of bifenthrin. Administered dose and blood
and brain concentration can be used as dose metrics to estimate the effects of low dose,
environmentally relevant, bifenthrin concentrations on motor function. In the present study
the relationship between brain concentration and locomotor activity is independent of time.
In contrast, the relationships between administered dose and locomotor activity and
bifenthrin blood concentrations are different at the two time points. This suggests that
momentary brain concentrations may be a better predictor of the behavioral toxicity of
bifenthrin than are blood concentrations and administered dose. Knowing the concentration
of toxicant at the target site and confidently relating it to effect can result in risk assessments
with lower uncertainties than just using administered dose.

The potential for human exposure to pyrethroid pesticides has prompted pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic research to better characterize risk. This work tested the hypothesis that blood
and brain concentrations of the pyrethroid bifenthrin are predictive of neurotoxic effects. Adult
male Long Evans rats received a single oral dose of bifenthrin dissolved in corn oil. Using 
figure-eight mazes, motor activity was measured for 1 h at 4- and 7-h following exposure to bifenthrin
(0-16 mg/kg or 0-9 mg/kg, respectively; n = 4-8/group). Whole blood and brains were collected
immediately following motor activity assays. Bifenthrin concentrations in blood and brain were
quantified using HPLC/MS/MS. Bifenthrin exposure decreased motor activity from 20% to 70%
in a dose-dependent manner at both time points. The relationship between motor activity data and
administered dose, and blood and brain bifenthrin concentrations were described using a sigmoidal
Emax model. The relationships between motor activity and administered dose or blood
concentrations were different between the 4- and 7-h time points. The relationship between motor
activity and brain concentration was not significantly different between the two time points. These
data suggest that momentary brain concentration of bifenthrin may be a more precise dose metric

4. Discussion

This study demonstrates that administered dose and blood and brain concentrations of
bifenthrin are predictors of behavioral change in rats. However, the best predictor of these
three dose metrics is bifenthrin brain concentration, in part because within the parameters of
the experiment (i.e., 4- and 7-h time points), it was independent of time of exposure. In
contrast, the relationship between administered dose and blood concentrations of bifenthrin
with motor activity are time dependent. The results suggest that momentary brain
concentration of bifenthrin is an important dose metric in the prediction of neurotoxicity in
rats and may be useful for cross-species extrapolations. Furthermore, these findings are
consistent with data from other studies (Anand et al., 2006; Gray et al., 1980; Kim et al.,
2010; Rickard and Brodie 1985; Sheets et al., 1994; White et al., 1976) in which
concentrations of parent pyrethroids were associated with behavioral effects.
In the first several hours after an oral exposure to a chemical, its concentration in blood can
change because of the dynamics of this compartment. Concentrations of chemicals in the
blood are sensitive to absorption, distribution and metabolic and renal clearance. Depending
on the volatility of the chemical, pulmonary clearance may also be an important factor.
Following the absorption and distribution phases, the concentrations of chemicals in blood is
less dynamic. In the present study, blood bifenthrin concentration was related to
administered dose in a time-dependent manner. The 4-and 7-h groups have different slopes
when administered dose was used to predict blood concentration. There was a significant
drop in blood levels, between the 4- and 7-h time points, which was likely due to the
distribution of bifenthrin into tissues and metabolic clearance of bifenthrin.
Motor activity is a measure of acute bifenthrin toxicity. In this study, bifenthrin exposure
produced a dose-dependent decrease in motor activity at both 4 and 7 h after treatment. This
is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in motor
activity in rats following acute oral doses of pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin,
permethrin, cismethrin, fenvalerate, and cyfluthrin (Crofton et al., 1995; Crofton and Reiter,
1984, 1987, 1988; Gilbert et al., 1990; McDaniel and Moser, 1993; Wolansky et al., 2006).
Bifenthrin was more potent at the 4- than at the 7-h time point and there was no difference in
the relationship between administered dose and bifenthrin brain concentrations between the
4- and 7-h time points. The relationship between brain concentration and decreased motor
activity was equivalent between the two time points and indicates that brain concentrations
are a better predictor than blood concentrations and administered dose of the acute
behavioral effects of bifenthrin.
Several studies suggest that toxicity from pyrethroids occur when central nervous system
pyrethroid concentrations exceed threshold quantities. Threshold estimates for deltamethrin
from iv exposures in rats range from 100 to 500 ng/g brain tissue (Gray and Rickard, 1981,
1982a,b). Tremors and choreoathetosis were observed in rabbits when brain levels of the
Type II pyrethroid cypermethrin reached 0.7 ng/g (Khanna et al., 2002). Type I pyrethroids
cismethrin and bioresmethrin, administered orally and iv to rats, were much less toxic,
requiring 500-1200 ng/g and 5000 ng/g, respectively, for effects to be observed (Gray et al.,
1980; Gray and Rickard, 1982a; White et al., 1976). The studies examining tissue

concentrations and behavior focused on high dose behavioral changes such as tremors,
choreoathetosis and salivation. According to the present study, brain bifenthrin
concentration corresponding to a 50% decrease in motor activity was approximately 289
ng/g (Fig. 3C). The data from the present study are consistent with earlier studies suggesting
that higher concentrations of the Type I pyrethroids are necessary to produce behavioral
toxicities than the Type II pyrethroids. However, as the sodium channel, the proposed target
of the pyrethroids (Soderlund et al., 2002), is present in the central and peripheral nervous
system, our results cannot rule out a role for an effect of bifenthrin on the peripheral nervous
system.
This study examined the relationships between exposure (oral administration), dose (tissue
concentration), and response (motor activity) of bifenthrin. Administered dose and blood
and brain concentration can be used as dose metrics to estimate the effects of low dose,
environmentally relevant, bifenthrin concentrations on motor function. In the present study
the relationship between brain concentration and locomotor activity is independent of time.
In contrast, the relationships between administered dose and locomotor activity and
bifenthrin blood concentrations are different at the two time points. This suggests that
momentary brain concentrations may be a better predictor of the behavioral toxicity of
bifenthrin than are blood concentrations and administered dose. Knowing the concentration
of toxicant at the target site and confidently relating it to effect can result in risk assessments
with lower uncertainties than just using administered dose.

3. Results
3.1. Exposure-dose relationships
Linear models were used to determine the relationship between administered dose (i.e.,
exposure) and tissue concentrations (i.e., internal dose) of bifenthrin. A linear model
significantly (p < 0.001) fit the administered dose vs. blood concentration data for both the
4- and 7-h time points (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The linear model underestimated the blood
concentrations in the low dose region at the 4-h time point. While a linear model fit both
time points, the slopes were significantly different between the two time points (F1,84 =
19.5; p < 0.0003). The slope of the 4-h group (24.9 ± 3.1; mean ± SE; n = 50) was
approximately 5 times greater than that of the 7-h group (4.6 ± 0.8; n = 38). A linear model
also fit the administered dose vs. brain concentrations data for both the 4- and 7-h time
points. The slope of the relationship between administered dose and brain concentrations of
bifenthrin was not significantly different (F1,85 =3.7; p = 0.058) between the 4- (32.8 ± 1.5)
and 7-h (27.9 ± 1.7) time points and a single equation fits both data sets (Table 1; Fig.
Toxicology. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 17.

1B).Thus, the relationship between administered dose and brain concentrations of bifenthrin
is similar for both the 4-and 7-h time points.
There were no dose-dependent differences in the brain:blood ratios of bifenthrin at 4 (F7,42
= 1.8; p = 0.12) and 7 h (F6,37 = 1.35; p = 0.27) (Fig. 2A and B).The brain:blood ratio in the
7-h animals was significantly higher than the 4-h group (t-test, p<0.01), 6.0 ± 3.3 vs. 2.6 ±
1.4 (mean ± SD), respectively. The greater ratio in the 7-h group can be attributed to the
lower blood concentrations in the rats at this time point (Fig. 1A) and similar brain
concentrations at the two time points (Fig. 1B).
The relationship between bifenthrin brain and blood concentrations was evaluated using the
sigmoidal Emax model. The fits of this model to the 4- and 7-h groups were significantly
different (F3,88 = 7.6; p < 0.0001) (Table 2, Fig. 1C). The shape parameter of the model at
the 4-h time point was close to unity, suggesting a linear relationship between blood and
brain concentrations. At the 7-h time point, the shape parameter of the model was estimated
at 2.1 ± 1.1, suggesting a slight non-linear relationship between blood and brain
concentrations. These data demonstrate that the relationship between brain and blood
concentration of bifenthrin is dependent upon the time of exposure.
3.2. Target tissue dose-effect relationships
The fit of the sigmoidal Emax model to the administered dose vs. motor activity (MA) data
was significantly different (F4,84 = 3.8; p = 0.0068) between the 4- and 7-h groups (Table 3,
Fig. 3A). The difference between the two time points was in the ED50, with the 4-h time
point approximately 30 times lower than the 7-h time point (0.24 vs. 6.0, respectively). In
addition, the shape parameter of the dose-response relationship for the 4-h group was
approximately 3 times higher than that for the 7-h group, 2.0 vs. 0.6, respectively.
The relationship between bifenthrin blood concentrations and motor activity was also
significantly different for the two time points (F4,87=4.7; p = 0.0019) (Table 4; Fig. 3B). The
value of the shape parameter, n, when near unity suggests a linear relationship, while the
shape of the dose-response relationship becomes increasingly threshold-like as n increases.
The shape of the 4-h data was more threshold-like compared to the 7-h data based on the
estimated shape parameter of 3.3 vs. 0.3, respectively. These data suggest that the
relationship between bifenthrin blood concentrations and behavior is different between the
two time points.
The sigmoidal Emax model fits to the 4- and 7-h bifenthrin brain concentration vs. motor
activity data (Table 4; Fig. 3C) were not significantly different from each other (F4,90 = 2.0;
p = 0.11). Therefore, the two data sets were combined and analyzed. The sigmoidal Emax
model fit had a shape parameter of 1.47, suggesting slight non-linearity. These results
indicate that the relationship between brain concentrations of bifenthrin and behavior is
consistent between the two time points.

Pyrethroid insecticides are synthetic derivatives of pyrethrins, the natural insecticidal
compounds found in the chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cineraraefolum (Bradberry et al.,
2005). Pyrethroids are often classified into two groups based upon chemical structure and
neurotoxicological effect. Type I pyrethroids, which lack an alpha-cyano moiety, induce in
rats a syndrome consisting of aggressive sparring, altered sensitivity to external stimuli, and
fine tremor progressing to whole-body tremor and prostration (T-syndrome). Type II
pyrethroids, which contain an alpha-cyano moiety, produce in rats a syndrome that includes
pawing, burrowing, salivation, and coarse tremors leading to choreoathetosis (CS-syndrome)
(Verschoyle and Aldridge, 1980; Lawrence and Casida, 1982). While this classification is
useful in characterizing these chemicals, there are a few pyrethroids that elicit neurotoxic
signs of both syndromes (Verschoyle and Aldridge, 1980; Soderlund et al., 2002). In
addition, this classification is based on high dose effects and may not relate to low dose
effects of pyrethroids (Shafer et al., 2005; Soderlund et al., 2002; Wolansky and Harrill,
2008). Regardless of classification, pyrethroids primarily act by disrupting voltage gated ion
channels (Soderlund et al., 2002).
The neurotoxicity of pyrethroids appears to be due to parent compound. Induction of
neurotoxicity is rapid following intracerebral administration of pyrethroids in laboratory
animals (Lawrence and Casida, 1982; Gray and Rickard, 1982a,b). Brain concentrations of
the pyrethroid deltamethrin correlate with neurotoxic endpoints (Rickard and Brodie, 1985;
Anand et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010). Rickard and Brodie (1985) also note that direct
injection of phenoxybenzoic acid, a hydrolyzed product of deltamethrin, into rat brain was
without neurotoxic effect.
Several studies have examined the relationship between blood or brain pyrethroid
concentrations and their neurotoxic effects. In rats, the brain concentration of deltamethrin
correlates with the induction of the CS-syndrome and the T-syndrome for cismethrin and
bioresmethrin (Gray et al., 1980; Rickard and Brodie 1985; White et al., 1976). For each
pyrethroid, a chemical specific threshold level in brain was required for the neurobehavioral
effects (tremors for bioresmethrin and cismethrin, tremors and choreoathetosis for
deltamethrin) to develop. These brain concentrations were approximately 3 nmol/g for
deltamethrin, 3.5 nmol/g for cismethrin and 14.5 nmol/g for bioresmethrin. Sheets et al.
(1994) reported brain concentrations of deltamethrin were associated with a neurotoxic
response (acoustic startle response) and lethality in rats. More recently, Anand et al. (2006)
and Kim et al. (2010) correlated levels of deltamethrin in blood and brain with neurotoxic
signs measured as salivation and tremors. Overall, these data suggest that for neurotoxicity,

momentary brain concentration may be a useful dose metric for pyrethroids; however, these
studies are limited in dose-response information.
In risk assessments, using a dose metric, that quantitatively describes the relationship
between exposure, internal dose, and adverse effect can enhance the accuracy in
extrapolation across species (Gentry et al., 2002). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that
momentary pyrethroid blood and brain concentration correlates with behavioral changes.
Bifenthrin, a Type I pyrethroid, was chosen as a prototype pyrethroid. Metabolites of
pyrethroids are thought to be non-neurotoxic (Soderlund et al., 2002), therefore, blood and
brain concentrations of bifenthrin were quantified and used as dose metrics. Motor activity
was chosen as the behavioral endpoint because it is a low dose effect of Type I pyrethroids
(Wolansky and Harrill, 2008). Evaluating the relationship between tissue concentration and
behavioral effect will aid in determining if brain or blood concentrations are better
descriptors of a “biologically effective” dose than is administered dose. With this type of
data, more informative physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
models can be developed and decrease uncertainties in risk assessments of pyrethroids.
