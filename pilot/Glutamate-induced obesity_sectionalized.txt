>>>section: conclusion
Conclusions
In conclusion, the neonatal MSG-administered model of
obesity lowers sperm production and leads to a 
reduction in sperm storage in adult male rats. Moreover, the
acceleration of sperm transit time can have implications
for the sperm quality of these rats. Thus, further studies
should address (sperm motility, DNA integrity and fertility

assay) the relationship between glutamate-induced obesity
and epididymis function.

Methods
Parental generation
Wistar rats (males, n = 4 and females, n = 10) weighing
about 180 g (90 days of life), were adapted for seven days
in the Laboratory of Experimental Research of Gynecology
and Obstetrics, Department of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics. The rats were kept in collective cages in 
controlled conditions of temperature (22 ± 3°C), light (12h
light/dark cycle) and relative humidity (60 ± 5%). The
animals were fed laboratory chow (PurinaW) and tap
water ad libitum. All experimental procedures carried
out in this study were approved by the Committee for
Ethics in Animal Experimentation at the School of
Medicine of Botucatu - Unesp, São Paulo State, Brazil
(Protocol number: 318/2003).
Females (n = 10) were mated overnight with normal
males and sperm presence in vaginal wet smears in the
following morning was defined as day zero (0) of 
pregnancy. Pregnant rats were kept in individual cages 
during the pregnancy period (21 days), including vaginal
delivery and lactation periods (21 days).
Experimental rats
From the offspring obtained, eight newborns (NB) were
kept with their dams (one newborn/nipple, preferentially
males) throughout the lactation period (21 days). When
Page 2 of 6
the number of males would not reach eight, female NBs
were placed in the litter. This procedure was utilized to
obtain better and equal feeding for all NBs.
Male offspring were divided into two groups: rats that
received saline solution (2.0% NaCl - Control) 
subcutaneously (sc) at postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (Control
group, n = 9) and rats given a solution of monosodium
glutamate (MSG - 4.0 mg/g body weight, sc) at same
days as those of the control group (MSG group, n = 9)
[15,19,23-25]. After weaning, male rats were transferred
to collective cages (4 animals per cage) and kept in 
controlled conditions. This methodology is related to induce
lipohypertrophyin periepididymal fat [15].
Obesity parameter of male rats
The parameter of obesity was obtained by Lee index for
each male rat at month 4 of life (120 days). This index was
defined as the cube root of body weight (g) x 10 / 
naso-anal length (cm), for which a value equal to or less than
0.300 was classified as normal. Rats presenting values
higher than 0.300 were classified as obese [24,26] and
included in this experiment.
Body weight and weight of male reproductive organs
In adult age (120 days old), male rats from two 
experimental groups (n = 9; 1 per litter) were weighed and killed by
decapitation. The left testis and epididymis, vas deferens,
ventral prostate and seminal vesicle (without the 
coagulating gland and full of secretion) were removed and their 
absolute and relative weights determined.
Plasma hormonal assay
After decapitation of each rat, blood (between 0900 and
1100 h am) from the ruptured cervical vessel was collected
in a heparinized tube and evaluated for the determination
of plasma testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. The plasma
was obtained after centrifugation (2400 rpm, 20 min, 3.5°C)
in a refrigerated apparatus and was frozen at - 20°C until
the moment of hormonal determination. Plasma hormone
levels were determined by double-antibody 
radioimmuno-assay, using the Testosterone MaiaW kit (BiochemImmuno
System) and specific kits for FSH and LH, at the 
Neroendo-crinology Laboratory, Dental School of Ribeirão Preto, 
University of São Paulo - USP. All the samples were dosed in
the same assay, to avoid inter-assay errors. The lower 
detection limit was 0.064 ng/mL, with a 4% intra-assay error for
T; 0.04 ng/mL, with a 3.4% intra-assay error for LH; and
0.09ng/mL, with a 2.8% intra-assay error for FSH.
Daily sperm production per testis, sperm number and
transit time in the epididymis
Homogenization-resistant testicular spermatids (step 19
of spermiogenesis) and sperm in the caput/corpus
Fernandes et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2012, 10:105
http://www.rbej.com/content/10/1/105
epididymis and cauda epididymis were enumerated as
described previously by Robb et al. [27], with adaptations
adopted by Fernandes et al. [28]. Briefly, each left testis,
decapsulated and weighed soon after collection, was
homogenized in 5 ml of NaCl 0.9% containing Triton X
100 0.5%, followed by sonication for 30 sec. After a 
10-fold dilution a sample was transferred to Newbauer
chambers (4 fields per animal), preceding a count of 
mature spermatids. To calculate daily sperm production
(DSP) the number of spermatids at step 19 was divided
by 6.1, which is the number of days of the seminiferous
cycle in which these spermatids are present in the 
seminiferous epithelium. Then, the DSP per gram was 
calculated in order to determine the efficiency of the process
[29]. In the same manner, caput/corpus and cauda 
epidi-dymidis portions were cut into small fragments with
scissors and homogenized, and sperm counted as
described for the testis. The sperm transit time through
the epididymis was determined by dividing the number
of sperm in each portion by the DSP.
Histopathological evaluation
The right testis and epididymis in 5 animals per group
were removed and fixed in Alfac fixing solution (80%
ethanol, formaldehyde and glacial acetic acid, 8.5:1.0:0.5,
v/v) for 24 h. The pieces were embedded in paraffin wax
and sectioned at 7 μm. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Morphometric and stereological analysis
Using an imaging analysis system (Leica Q-Win Software
version 3 for Windows™), the testicular morphometry
and stereological analyses of the epididymis (cauda, 
region 6A) were accomplished by utilizing H&E sections
[28]. Morphometric analysis was performed to evaluate
seminiferous epithelium height and tubular diameter.
For this study 10 sections per animal were measured
(stage IX of spermatogenic cycle) at X 200 magnification.
Random H&E images of 75 histological fields per 
experimental group were captured and analyzed by the
stereological method such that histological fragments of
all animals were evaluated equally (15 per animal).
Stereological analyses were obtained by Weibel’s 
multipurpose graticulate, with 120 points and 60 test lines
[30] to compare the epididymal components (epithelium,
stroma and lumen) in the experimental groups.
Number of Sertoli cells per seminiferous tubule
To evaluate the process of proliferation of Sertoli cells,
nuclei were counted in histological cuts (5-μm-thick)
from the testis of rats at adulthood, in 20 seminiferous
tubules per rat at stage VII of spermatogenesis, classified
according to Leblond and Clermont [31].
Page 3 of 6
Statistical analysis
For comparison of results between the experimental
groups, the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test was
employed according to the characteristics of each 
variable. The results were considered significant for p<0.05.

RESEARCH
Glutamate-induced obesity leads to decreased
sperm reserves and acceleration of transit time in
the epididymis of adult male rats

Abstract
Background: Given the established fact that obesity interferes with male reproductive functions, the present study
aimed to evaluate sperm production in the testis and storage in the epididymis in a glutamate-induced model of
obesity.
Methods: Male rats were treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at doses of 4 mg/kg
subcutaneously, or with saline solution (control group), on postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. On day 120, obesity was
confirmed by the Lee index in all MSG-treated rats. After this, all animals from the two experimental groups were
anesthetized and killed to evaluate body and reproductive organ weights, sperm parameters, plasma hormone
levels (FSH, LH and testosterone), testicular and epididymal histo-morphometry and histopathology.
Results: Significant reductions in absolute and relative weights of testis, epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicle
were noted in MSG-treated animals. In these same animals plasma testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) concentrations were decreased, as well as sperm counts in the testis and epididymis and seminiferous
epithelium height and tubular diameter. The sperm transit time was accelerated in obese rats. However, the
number of Sertoli cells per seminiferous tubule and stereological findings on the epididymis were not markedly
changed by obesity.
Conclusions: Neonatal MSG-administered model of obesity lowers sperm production and leads to a reduction in
sperm storage in the epididymis of adult male rats. The acceleration of sperm transit time can have implications for
the sperm quality of these rats.

Background
Obesity is increasing worldwide and it represents a 
challenge to the scientific community being major public
health concern [1]. It is a heterogeneous disorder with
wide variations in risks for complicating diseases [2] and
has been associated with an increased risk of many 
serious illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
mellitus and some types of cancer [3].
Although the negative effects of obesity on 
reproductive function were first documented more than 2000

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article
years ago by Hippocrates [4], the etiology of the adverse
effects of this relationship has not been studied in depth.
There is little data on human male reproductive 
outcomes, but have shown that overweight and obese men
present hormonal changes such as lower plasma levels
of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total 
testosterone, free testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) [5-7]. Nevertheless, lower sperm counts [8,9],
poor semen quality [7], decreased normal-motile sperm
cells and increased DNA fragmentation index [10] were
described in men that showed increased body mass
index (BMI). Recent information obtained from different
population studies suggests an inverse relationship 
between the increase in body mass index and fertilityUnivEstadualPaulista,

[7,11]. However, there were few studies that relate 
obesity to male reproductive dysfunction, and the existents
are inconclusive. According to Sallmen et al. [9], 
programs to prevent obesity may improve men’s 
reproductive health and save medical costs for infertility
treatment.
Due to the difficulty of studying obesity-induced 
reproductive complications in men, experimental models
have been used. The induction of obesity may be 
performed in animals by neuroendocrine, dietary or genetic
changes [12]. According to one of these models if 
neonatal rats are treated with monosodium glutamate
(MSG) in the neonatal period, they become obese
through the course of development [13-19]. Neonatal
MSG treatment leads to the destruction of specific sites
in the hypothalamus, including ventromedial and 
arcuate nuclei, in turn provoking disorders in the control of
absorption and energy-expenditure-specific mechanisms
resulting in a state of obesity [20,21].
No study evaluated the effects of this obesity model on
the epididymal structure or function -organ responsible
for sperm maturation and survival [22]. Thus, the
present study aimed to evaluate the histopathology,
morphometry and storage sperm in the epididymis in
obese male rats due to neonatal MSG treatment. 
Nevertheless, plasma hormonal assay, sperm production and
morphometric analysis in the testis were also evaluated.
Methods
Parental generation
Wistar rats (males, n = 4 and females, n = 10) weighing
about 180 g (90 days of life), were adapted for seven days
in the Laboratory of Experimental Research of Gynecology
and Obstetrics, Department of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics. The rats were kept in collective cages in 
controlled conditions of temperature (22 ± 3°C), light (12h
light/dark cycle) and relative humidity (60 ± 5%). The
animals were fed laboratory chow (PurinaW) and tap
water ad libitum. All experimental procedures carried
out in this study were approved by the Committee for
Ethics in Animal Experimentation at the School of
Medicine of Botucatu - Unesp, São Paulo State, Brazil
(Protocol number: 318/2003).
Females (n = 10) were mated overnight with normal
males and sperm presence in vaginal wet smears in the
following morning was defined as day zero (0) of 
pregnancy. Pregnant rats were kept in individual cages 
during the pregnancy period (21 days), including vaginal
delivery and lactation periods (21 days).
Experimental rats
From the offspring obtained, eight newborns (NB) were
kept with their dams (one newborn/nipple, preferentially
males) throughout the lactation period (21 days). When
Page 2 of 6
the number of males would not reach eight, female NBs
were placed in the litter. This procedure was utilized to
obtain better and equal feeding for all NBs.
Male offspring were divided into two groups: rats that
received saline solution (2.0% NaCl - Control) 
subcutaneously (sc) at postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (Control
group, n = 9) and rats given a solution of monosodium
glutamate (MSG - 4.0 mg/g body weight, sc) at same
days as those of the control group (MSG group, n = 9)
[15,19,23-25]. After weaning, male rats were transferred
to collective cages (4 animals per cage) and kept in 
controlled conditions. This methodology is related to induce
lipohypertrophyin periepididymal fat [15].
Obesity parameter of male rats
The parameter of obesity was obtained by Lee index for
each male rat at month 4 of life (120 days). This index was
defined as the cube root of body weight (g) x 10 / 
naso-anal length (cm), for which a value equal to or less than
0.300 was classified as normal. Rats presenting values
higher than 0.300 were classified as obese [24,26] and
included in this experiment.
Body weight and weight of male reproductive organs
In adult age (120 days old), male rats from two 
experimental groups (n = 9; 1 per litter) were weighed and killed by
decapitation. The left testis and epididymis, vas deferens,
ventral prostate and seminal vesicle (without the 
coagulating gland and full of secretion) were removed and their 
absolute and relative weights determined.
Plasma hormonal assay
After decapitation of each rat, blood (between 0900 and
1100 h am) from the ruptured cervical vessel was collected
in a heparinized tube and evaluated for the determination
of plasma testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. The plasma
was obtained after centrifugation (2400 rpm, 20 min, 3.5°C)
in a refrigerated apparatus and was frozen at - 20°C until
the moment of hormonal determination. Plasma hormone
levels were determined by double-antibody 
radioimmuno-assay, using the Testosterone MaiaW kit (BiochemImmuno
System) and specific kits for FSH and LH, at the 
Neroendo-crinology Laboratory, Dental School of Ribeirão Preto, 
University of São Paulo - USP. All the samples were dosed in
the same assay, to avoid inter-assay errors. The lower 
detection limit was 0.064 ng/mL, with a 4% intra-assay error for
T; 0.04 ng/mL, with a 3.4% intra-assay error for LH; and
0.09ng/mL, with a 2.8% intra-assay error for FSH.
Daily sperm production per testis, sperm number and
transit time in the epididymis
Homogenization-resistant testicular spermatids (step 19
of spermiogenesis) and sperm in the caput/corpus
Fernandes et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2012, 10:105
http://www.rbej.com/content/10/1/105
epididymis and cauda epididymis were enumerated as
described previously by Robb et al. [27], with adaptations
adopted by Fernandes et al. [28]. Briefly, each left testis,
decapsulated and weighed soon after collection, was
homogenized in 5 ml of NaCl 0.9% containing Triton X
100 0.5%, followed by sonication for 30 sec. After a 
10-fold dilution a sample was transferred to Newbauer
chambers (4 fields per animal), preceding a count of 
mature spermatids. To calculate daily sperm production
(DSP) the number of spermatids at step 19 was divided
by 6.1, which is the number of days of the seminiferous
cycle in which these spermatids are present in the 
seminiferous epithelium. Then, the DSP per gram was 
calculated in order to determine the efficiency of the process
[29]. In the same manner, caput/corpus and cauda 
epidi-dymidis portions were cut into small fragments with
scissors and homogenized, and sperm counted as
described for the testis. The sperm transit time through
the epididymis was determined by dividing the number
of sperm in each portion by the DSP.
Histopathological evaluation
The right testis and epididymis in 5 animals per group
were removed and fixed in Alfac fixing solution (80%
ethanol, formaldehyde and glacial acetic acid, 8.5:1.0:0.5,
v/v) for 24 h. The pieces were embedded in paraffin wax
and sectioned at 7 μm. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Morphometric and stereological analysis
Using an imaging analysis system (Leica Q-Win Software
version 3 for Windows™), the testicular morphometry
and stereological analyses of the epididymis (cauda, 
region 6A) were accomplished by utilizing H&E sections
[28]. Morphometric analysis was performed to evaluate
seminiferous epithelium height and tubular diameter.
For this study 10 sections per animal were measured
(stage IX of spermatogenic cycle) at X 200 magnification.
Random H&E images of 75 histological fields per 
experimental group were captured and analyzed by the
stereological method such that histological fragments of
all animals were evaluated equally (15 per animal).
Stereological analyses were obtained by Weibel’s 
multipurpose graticulate, with 120 points and 60 test lines
[30] to compare the epididymal components (epithelium,
stroma and lumen) in the experimental groups.
Number of Sertoli cells per seminiferous tubule
To evaluate the process of proliferation of Sertoli cells,
nuclei were counted in histological cuts (5-μm-thick)
from the testis of rats at adulthood, in 20 seminiferous
tubules per rat at stage VII of spermatogenesis, classified
according to Leblond and Clermont [31].

Statistical analysis
For comparison of results between the experimental
groups, the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test was
employed according to the characteristics of each 
variable. The results were considered significant for p<0.05.
Results
Table 1 shows the Lee index range found in both groups.
Although there was data for obesity in control group in
some rats, obesity was totally confirmed by Lee index in
all rats of MSG - treated group (Table 1) which showed
significant diminished body weight and naso-anal length
in relation to control group. Nevertheless, male obese
rats presented significant reductions in absolute and
relative weights of the testis, epididymis, prostate and
seminal vesicle (Table 1). Plasma testosterone and FSH
levels were significantly diminished in male obese rats.
However, plasma LH levels presented similarity between
groups (Table 2).
Experimental obesity led to a significant decrease in
the numbers of testicular spermatids and sperm in the
caput/corpus and cauda epididymidis, and a significant
decrease in daily sperm production (DSP) (Table 3).
However, there was no significant decrease in DSP/g of
testis in the MSG group. In the male obese rats there
was also a significant reduction in the sperm transit time
in the cauda epididymidis, but not in the caput/corpus
epididymidis (Table 3).
Histopathological evaluation of the testis and 
epididymis did not reveal treatment-related morphological
alterations (data not shown). The morphometric 
testicular analysis showed significant reductions in tubular 
diameter and seminiferous epithelium height in male obese
rats (Table 4). The Sertoli cell number per seminiferous
tubule (Control: 18.46 ± 1.57 and MSG: 16.02 ± 1.83;
Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test).

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that neonatal treatment with
MSG alters the epididymal parameters by reducing sperm
storage and accelerating sperm transit time. Furthermore,
the present data confirm previous results showing that
neonatal treatment with MSG is able to induce obesity
(high Lee index, small corporal weight and naso-anal
length) [32-36] although few control rats also presented
obesity status by Lee index, related to aging [19]. Thus,
neonatal treatment with MSG caused a cessation of growth
and development with a concomitant accumulation of
body fat leading to a decrease in body weight in relation to
control group. Neonatal MSG treatment is a model of
obesity in rodents which causes alterations in hypothalamic
arcuate nucleus (ARC) and impairs leptin and insulin 
signaling in this region [37-39] resulting in hyperleptinemia
and hyperinsulinemia. When the hypothalamic 
ventro-medial nucleus and arcuate nucleus are destroyed in rats
by treatment with MSG in the neonatal stage, obesity
occurs as the rats grow [40].
Wet-weight alterations in the reproductive organs 
constitute a parameter for indicating changes in sex hormone
levels [41]. In this study, the significant reduction in the
weights of all analyzed organs in obese rats corroborate
with the reduction of testosterone levels. As mentioned
previously, the obesity induced by glutamate is obtained

through a hypothalamic injury that disrupts the secretion
of hormones including the gonadotrophins (FSH and LH)
[42,43]. According to França et al. [18], in this obesity
model, significant diminutions in the testosterone and
FSH levels are related to disrupted HPG axis 
development due to the hyperleptinemia. In the same manner,
Tena-Sempere et al. [44] reported that a possible cause
for this severe reduction in the testosterone levels in 
animals neonatally treated with glutamate may have been
due to an increase in plasma leptin levels. However, 
despite the decreased testosterone and FSH levels, the LH
levels (hormone directly involved in regulating 
testosterone secretion) were unchanged by MSG treatment. This
result can be related with severe ARC lesions [24,45,46]
and so we suggest that MSG specifically leads to lesions
in FSH neurons. Moreover, it is important to emphasize
that the hormonal profile of obese men is characterized
by decreased total and, often, free testosterone levels,
diminished gonadotropin levels, and increased circulating
estrogen levels [47].
The number of spermatids present in the testis and the
total DSP are important indicators of male fertility potential
[29]. In the present study,
the
reduction in sperm
Fernandes et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2012, 10:105
http://www.rbej.com/content/10/1/105
production led by MSG-induced obesity was associated
with reduced testicular weight, seminiferous tubular 
diameter, testicular seminiferous epithelium height and 
testosterone and FSH levels. On the other hand, França et al. [18]
showed unchanged sperm production, testis weight and
seminiferous tubular diameter in obese adult rats after 
neonatal glutamate-induced obesity. In this sense, it is known
that the number of Sertoli cells, established during the 
prepubertal period, determines the final testicular size and the
magnitude of sperm production in sexually mature animals
[48-50]. In the present study the number of Sertoli cells did
not change in the obese rats, as well as the efficiency of the
spermatogenic process, as evidenced by results of DSP per
gram of testis that were similar between the experimental
groups. It is possible that the disturbance in the HPG axis
due to MSG treatment compromises the real significance
of reduced FSH plasma levels observed in the present
model. Evaluation of inhibin B levels in MSG rats could
provide additional information regarding Sertoli cell 
function [18]. Thus, this experimental model may produces
lightly different results between different research groups,
as disclosed in the literature.
The reduction in sperm count in the epididymis in obese
rats was probably responsible by the decrease of the 
epididymal weight and contributed for the acceleration of the
sperm transit time through the epididymis. Acceleration in
sperm transit time can impair sperm maturation and 
reduce the number of gametes available for ejaculation and
fertility [51]. These alteration were independent of 
epididymal components (epithelium, stroma and lumen) since
they are unaffected by glutamate-induced obesity.
It is very known that in obesity conditions there is an 
excess of leptin which is secreted by the adipocytes [44]. 
Studies show that the plasma leptin concentrations were
significantly elevated in both humans [52,53] and in rodent
obesity models [54,55], and directly proportional to the
amount of fat. Leptin is important for the regulation of food
intake, energy metabolism and reproductive function
[55-58]. It has been proposed that a specific narrow leptin
concentration range is necessary to maintain normal 
reproductive function, and levels below or above these thresholds
are critical to this peptide’s influence on the function of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis [57,58] by 
acting on hypothalamic receptors and also by promoting 
peripheral effects [17]. However, the relationship between high
leptin levels and the male reproductive system is not clear.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the neonatal MSG-administered model of
obesity lowers sperm production and leads to a 
reduction in sperm storage in adult male rats. Moreover, the
acceleration of sperm transit time can have implications
for the sperm quality of these rats. Thus, further studies
should address (sperm motility, DNA integrity and fertility

assay) the relationship between glutamate-induced obesity
and epididymis function.

Abstract
Background: Given the established fact that obesity interferes with male reproductive functions, the present study
aimed to evaluate sperm production in the testis and storage in the epididymis in a glutamate-induced model of
obesity.
Methods: Male rats were treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at doses of 4 mg/kg
subcutaneously, or with saline solution (control group), on postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. On day 120, obesity was
confirmed by the Lee index in all MSG-treated rats. After this, all animals from the two experimental groups were
anesthetized and killed to evaluate body and reproductive organ weights, sperm parameters, plasma hormone
levels (FSH, LH and testosterone), testicular and epididymal histo-morphometry and histopathology.
Results: Significant reductions in absolute and relative weights of testis, epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicle
were noted in MSG-treated animals. In these same animals plasma testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) concentrations were decreased, as well as sperm counts in the testis and epididymis and seminiferous
epithelium height and tubular diameter. The sperm transit time was accelerated in obese rats. However, the
number of Sertoli cells per seminiferous tubule and stereological findings on the epididymis were not markedly
changed by obesity.
Conclusions: Neonatal MSG-administered model of obesity lowers sperm production and leads to a reduction in
sperm storage in the epididymis of adult male rats. The acceleration of sperm transit time can have implications for
the sperm quality of these rats.

Background
Obesity is increasing worldwide and it represents a 
challenge to the scientific community being major public
health concern [1]. It is a heterogeneous disorder with
wide variations in risks for complicating diseases [2] and
has been associated with an increased risk of many 
serious illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
mellitus and some types of cancer [3].
Although the negative effects of obesity on 
reproductive function were first documented more than 2000

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article
years ago by Hippocrates [4], the etiology of the adverse
effects of this relationship has not been studied in depth.
There is little data on human male reproductive 
outcomes, but have shown that overweight and obese men
present hormonal changes such as lower plasma levels
of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total 
testosterone, free testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) [5-7]. Nevertheless, lower sperm counts [8,9],
poor semen quality [7], decreased normal-motile sperm
cells and increased DNA fragmentation index [10] were
described in men that showed increased body mass
index (BMI). Recent information obtained from different
population studies suggests an inverse relationship 
between the increase in body mass index and fertilityUnivEstadualPaulista,

[7,11]. However, there were few studies that relate 
obesity to male reproductive dysfunction, and the existents
are inconclusive. According to Sallmen et al. [9], 
programs to prevent obesity may improve men’s 
reproductive health and save medical costs for infertility
treatment.
Due to the difficulty of studying obesity-induced 
reproductive complications in men, experimental models
have been used. The induction of obesity may be 
performed in animals by neuroendocrine, dietary or genetic
changes [12]. According to one of these models if 
neonatal rats are treated with monosodium glutamate
(MSG) in the neonatal period, they become obese
through the course of development [13-19]. Neonatal
MSG treatment leads to the destruction of specific sites
in the hypothalamus, including ventromedial and 
arcuate nuclei, in turn provoking disorders in the control of
absorption and energy-expenditure-specific mechanisms
resulting in a state of obesity [20,21].
No study evaluated the effects of this obesity model on
the epididymal structure or function -organ responsible
for sperm maturation and survival [22]. Thus, the
present study aimed to evaluate the histopathology,
morphometry and storage sperm in the epididymis in
obese male rats due to neonatal MSG treatment. 
Nevertheless, plasma hormonal assay, sperm production and
morphometric analysis in the testis were also evaluated.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that neonatal treatment with
MSG alters the epididymal parameters by reducing sperm
storage and accelerating sperm transit time. Furthermore,
the present data confirm previous results showing that
neonatal treatment with MSG is able to induce obesity
(high Lee index, small corporal weight and naso-anal
length) [32-36] although few control rats also presented
obesity status by Lee index, related to aging [19]. Thus,
neonatal treatment with MSG caused a cessation of growth
and development with a concomitant accumulation of
body fat leading to a decrease in body weight in relation to
control group. Neonatal MSG treatment is a model of
obesity in rodents which causes alterations in hypothalamic
arcuate nucleus (ARC) and impairs leptin and insulin 
signaling in this region [37-39] resulting in hyperleptinemia
and hyperinsulinemia. When the hypothalamic 
ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus are destroyed in rats
by treatment with MSG in the neonatal stage, obesity
occurs as the rats grow [40].
Wet-weight alterations in the reproductive organs 
constitute a parameter for indicating changes in sex hormone
levels [41]. In this study, the significant reduction in the
weights of all analyzed organs in obese rats corroborate
with the reduction of testosterone levels. As mentioned
previously, the obesity induced by glutamate is obtained

through a hypothalamic injury that disrupts the secretion
of hormones including the gonadotrophins (FSH and LH)
[42,43]. According to França et al. [18], in this obesity
model, significant diminutions in the testosterone and
FSH levels are related to disrupted HPG axis 
development due to the hyperleptinemia. In the same manner,
Tena-Sempere et al. [44] reported that a possible cause
for this severe reduction in the testosterone levels in 
animals neonatally treated with glutamate may have been
due to an increase in plasma leptin levels. However, 
despite the decreased testosterone and FSH levels, the LH
levels (hormone directly involved in regulating 
testosterone secretion) were unchanged by MSG treatment. This
result can be related with severe ARC lesions [24,45,46]
and so we suggest that MSG specifically leads to lesions
in FSH neurons. Moreover, it is important to emphasize
that the hormonal profile of obese men is characterized
by decreased total and, often, free testosterone levels,
diminished gonadotropin levels, and increased circulating
estrogen levels [47].
The number of spermatids present in the testis and the
total DSP are important indicators of male fertility potential
[29]. In the present study,
the
reduction in sperm

production led by MSG-induced obesity was associated
with reduced testicular weight, seminiferous tubular 
diameter, testicular seminiferous epithelium height and 
testosterone and FSH levels. On the other hand, França et al. [18]
showed unchanged sperm production, testis weight and
seminiferous tubular diameter in obese adult rats after 
neonatal glutamate-induced obesity. In this sense, it is known
that the number of Sertoli cells, established during the 
prepubertal period, determines the final testicular size and the
magnitude of sperm production in sexually mature animals
[48-50]. In the present study the number of Sertoli cells did
not change in the obese rats, as well as the efficiency of the
spermatogenic process, as evidenced by results of DSP per
gram of testis that were similar between the experimental
groups. It is possible that the disturbance in the HPG axis
due to MSG treatment compromises the real significance
of reduced FSH plasma levels observed in the present
model. Evaluation of inhibin B levels in MSG rats could
provide additional information regarding Sertoli cell 
function [18]. Thus, this experimental model may produces
lightly different results between different research groups,
as disclosed in the literature.
The reduction in sperm count in the epididymis in obese
rats was probably responsible by the decrease of the 
epididymal weight and contributed for the acceleration of the
sperm transit time through the epididymis. Acceleration in
sperm transit time can impair sperm maturation and 
reduce the number of gametes available for ejaculation and
fertility [51]. These alteration were independent of 
epididymal components (epithelium, stroma and lumen) since
they are unaffected by glutamate-induced obesity.
It is very known that in obesity conditions there is an 
excess of leptin which is secreted by the adipocytes [44]. 
Studies show that the plasma leptin concentrations were
significantly elevated in both humans [52,53] and in rodent
obesity models [54,55], and directly proportional to the
amount of fat. Leptin is important for the regulation of food
intake, energy metabolism and reproductive function
[55-58]. It has been proposed that a specific narrow leptin
concentration range is necessary to maintain normal 
reproductive function, and levels below or above these thresholds
are critical to this peptide’s influence on the function of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis [57,58] by 
acting on hypothalamic receptors and also by promoting 
peripheral effects [17]. However, the relationship between high
leptin levels and the male reproductive system is not clear.

Results
Table 1 shows the Lee index range found in both groups.
Although there was data for obesity in control group in
some rats, obesity was totally confirmed by Lee index in
all rats of MSG - treated group (Table 1) which showed
significant diminished body weight and naso-anal length
in relation to control group. Nevertheless, male obese
rats presented significant reductions in absolute and
relative weights of the testis, epididymis, prostate and
seminal vesicle (Table 1). Plasma testosterone and FSH
levels were significantly diminished in male obese rats.
However, plasma LH levels presented similarity between
groups (Table 2).
Experimental obesity led to a significant decrease in
the numbers of testicular spermatids and sperm in the
caput/corpus and cauda epididymidis, and a significant
decrease in daily sperm production (DSP) (Table 3).
However, there was no significant decrease in DSP/g of
testis in the MSG group. In the male obese rats there
was also a significant reduction in the sperm transit time
in the cauda epididymidis, but not in the caput/corpus
epididymidis (Table 3).
Histopathological evaluation of the testis and 
epididymis did not reveal treatment-related morphological
alterations (data not shown). The morphometric 
testicular analysis showed significant reductions in tubular 
diameter and seminiferous epithelium height in male obese
rats (Table 4). The Sertoli cell number per seminiferous
tubule (Control: 18.46 ± 1.57 and MSG: 16.02 ± 1.83;
