The  ultimate  treatment  goal  of  diabetes  is  to  preserve  and  restore  islet  cell  function.  Treatment  of certain
diabetic  animal  models  with  incretins  has  been  reported  to  preserve  and  possibly  enhance  islet  function
and  promote  islet  cell  growth.  The  studies  reported  here  detail  islet  cell  anatomy  in animals  chronically
treated  with  the  incretin  analog,  liraglutide.  Our  aim  was  to quantitatively  and  qualitatively  analyze  islet
cells  from  diabetic  animals  treated with  vehicle  (control)  or liraglutide  to  determine  whether  normal  islet
cell anatomy  is  maintained  or enhanced  with  pharmaceutical  treatment.  We  harvested  pancreata  from
liraglutide  and  vehicle-treated  Zucker  Diabetic  Fatty  (ZDF)  rats  to examine  islet  structure  and  function
and  obtain  isolated  islets.  Twelve-week-old  male  rats  were  assigned  to 3  groups:  (1)  liraglutide-treated
diabetic,  (2)  vehicle-treated  diabetic,  and  (3)  lean  non-diabetic.  Liraglutide  was  given SC  twice  daily
for  9  weeks.  As  expected,  liraglutide  treatment  reduced  body  weight  by  15%  compared  to  the 
vehicle-treated  animals,  eventually  to levels  that were  not  different  from  lean  controls.  At the  termination  of
the  study,  blood  glucose  was significantly  less  in the  liraglutide-treated  rats compared  to  vehicle  treated
controls  (485.8  ± 22.5  and  547.2  ±  33.1 mg/dl,  respectively).  Insulin  content/islet  (measured  by  
immuno-histochemistry)  was  34.2 ± 0.7  pixel  units  in  vehicle-treated  rats,  and  54.9  ±  0.6  in  the  liraglutide-treated
animals. Glucose-stimulated  insulin  secretion  from  isolated  islets  (measured  as the stimulation  index)
was  maintained  in  the liraglutide-treated  rats,  but  not in  the vehicle-treated.  However,  liraglutide  did  not
preserve  normal  islet  architecture.  There  was  a decrease  in  the glucagon-positive  area/islet  and  in the  -
cell  numbers/area  with  liraglutide  treatment  (6.5  cells/field),  compared  to  vehicle  (17.9 cells/field).  There
was an increase  in  -cell  numbers,  the  - to  -cell  ratio  that  was  statistically  higher  in  the  
liraglutide-treated  rats  (24.3  ±  4.4)  compared  to vehicle  (9.1  ±  2.8).  Disrupted  mitochondria  were  more  commonly
observed  in  the  -cells  (51.9  ± 10.3%  of  cells)  than  in the  -cells  (27.2  ±  4.4%)  in the liraglutide-treated
group.  While  liraglutide  enhanced  or maintained  growth  and function  of certain  islet cells,  the overall
ratio  of  - to -cells  was decreased  and  there  was  an  absolute  reduction  in  islet  -cell content.  There
was  selective  disruption  of intracellular  -cell  organelles,  representing  an  uncoupling  of the  bihormonal
islet  signaling  that  is  required  for normal  metabolic  regulation.  The  relevance  of the findings  to  long-term
liraglutide  treatment  in  people  with  diabetes  is  unknown  and  should  be investigated  in appropriately
designed  clinical  studies.

1. Introduction
The incretin hormones are peptides released by the 
gastrointestinal tract in response to the ingestion of food. These hormones
enhance insulin secretion and regulate glucose homeostasis by
inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and 
controlling satiation, ultimately controlling body weight [1]. GLP-1
is one of the major incretin hormones that rapidly stimulates
insulin release. Several peptide drugs have been designed to mimic
the action of GLP-1, among them exenatide and liraglutide, with
the long-term goal of improving blood glucose regulation and
enhancing weight loss. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration
approved liraglutide for daily, chronic treatment of adults with
type 2 diabetes [2]. Liraglutide has 97% homology in amino acid
sequence with endogenous GLP-1 and is resistant to enzyme 
inactivation [3]. Administration of liraglutide to people with type 2
diabetes significantly reduced fasting glucose levels, decreased
HbA1c values, and decreased body weight [4]. There is indirect
evidence, based on the long-term stability of HbA1c levels, that
treatment with GLP-1 stabilizes islet cell function in humans, and
may  slow the usual progression of insulin depletion over time in
type 2 diabetes [5].
Diabetic  ZDF rats, and those with 60% pancreatectomies,
treated with  liraglutide have increased -cell mass, which is more
prominent  in the most obese animals as compared to the 
glucose-controlled animals [6]. -Cell glucose sensitivity was  restored with
GLP-1 treatment, resulting in increased insulin secretion in rats.
Conversely  glucagon secretion was inhibited [7,8]. The glucagon
inhibition is thought to be due to the immediate effect of the
incretin, as  direct exposure of an -cell culture line to GLP-1
also inhibited glucagon release [9]. In conditions where glucagon
production  and secretion are excessive, such inhibition may  be
beneficial [10]. While improved -cell regulation may  be a goal,
abnormal loss of -cells and/or their function would not be optimal
for glucose  homeostasis.
The increase in islet cell mass with improvement in glycemic
control raises the possibility that treatment with GLP-1 analogs
anatomically and, to some extent, physiologically reverses the
insulin deficiency characteristic of type 2 diabetes. The purpose
of this study was to determine whether the islets remaining after
long-term  GLP-1 administration possessed normal morphology
and function using an animal model of type 2 diabetes with 
emphasis on -cells. Arguably, any treatment that enhances islet cell
function in  diabetes should preserve or enhance normal islet cell
structure and function.
2. Methods
2.1. Animal  model
Male ZDF rats of 12 weeks of age on arrival were assigned
to 3 groups: (1) liraglutide-treated diabetic (strain code #370,
obese fa/fa), (2) vehicle-treated diabetic (strain code #370, obese
fa/fa), (3) lean non-diabetic (strain code #380, lean fa/+). Rats
were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Saint Louis, MO)
and allowed one week for acclimation prior to experimentation.
The rats received husbandry services at the Laboratory Animal
Resources facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The
rats were allowed food (Purina 5008) and water ad libitum and were
maintained  on a 12:12 light-dark cycle. All animal procedures were
performed  according to the IACUC guidelines of the University of
Kansas Medical Center and the studies were approved by the local
animal use  committee.
Body weights were recorded weekly on all rats. Blood glucose
levels were  assessed by a digital blood glucose meter (Accu-Chek
Active, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Weekly blood glucose
levels were  calculated as an average of daily levels measured for a
given week. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were determined by
a home evaluation unit (A1C Now At Home System, Bayers, 
Pitts-burgh, PA).  When rats had blood glucose or HbA1c levels higher
than the range of detection by the instrument, statistical 
analysis of the data followed previously published procedures [11,12].
Briefly, the  highest detectable value for blood glucose (600 mg/dl)
was substituted for the missing data.
Animals  were administered subcutaneous liraglutide for 9
weeks bid  (6 mg/ml; dissolved in vehicle of disodium hydrogen
phosphate  dihydrate, polyethylene glycol and H2O) at a final dose
T. Schwasinger-Schmidt et al. / Pharmacological Research 76 (2013) 58- 66
of 0.225 g/g body weight. At the termination of the study, rats
were over-anesthetized with tribromoethanol and the pancreas or
isolated islets processed according to the methods listed below.
2.2. Islet isolation
At  the termination of the study the pancreata were 
cannu-lated in situ  via the common bile duct, and distended with cold
collagenase  (CLS-1, Worthington Biochemical in Leibovitz L15 at
450 U/ml).  The distended pancreas was  excised and incubated for
20-30  min with gentle tumbling in a 37 ◦C incubator. The contents

of the  tube  were placed in diluted ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS) containing 5% fetal calf serum. The digest was
allowed to  settle at 1 × g and the supernatant removed and the
process repeated. The washed digest was  passed through a 500 m
screen  and  sedimented for 1 min  at 300 × g. The pellet was  mixed
with 10 ml of 1.110 g/ml Histopaque (density = 1.1085, Sigma 
Diag
nostics  Inc.)  and centrifuged. The islets floating on the interphase of
the gradient were collected, sedimented, and cleaned using a sterile
40 m  mesh cell strainer and HBSS with 5% fetal calf serum. Islets
were placed  into CMRL 1066 containing 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal
bovine  serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution.
2.3. Insulin  secretion
Islets were placed in duplicate wells and assigned to three
groups: basal glucose (1 mM),  low glucose (3 mM),  and high 
glucose (20 mM).  All wells were preincubated for 30 min in RPMI
1640 containing 3 mM glucose in a 37 ◦C containing 5% CO2. After
preincubation, media were removed from each well and discarded.
Basal,  low  or high glucose solutions were added to the 
duplicates.  After  30 min  static incubation in the 37 ◦C and 5% CO2, the
islets  were  sedimented and the conditioned medium was  
collected  to determine insulin content and frozen at −80 ◦C. Insulin
concentration was  determined by ELISA (ALPCO, Windham, NH).
The stimulation index was calculated as the amount of insulin
released at  low or high glucose divided by the basal insulin
amount.
2.4. Electron microscopy
Electron  microscopy was  conducted using 2 mm sections of 
pancreatic  tissue fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde. Samples were rinsed twice
in 0.1 M  sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 min prior to post fixation
in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Rinsing with distilled water was 
followed  by a  gradual ethanol dehydration (30%, 70%, 80%, 95%, 100%)
for 10  min  each. Samples were rinsed twice in propylene oxide for
15 min  prior to being infiltrated in a mixture of propylene oxide
and Embed  812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. 
Washington, PA) overnight. BEEM capsules were used to embed the samples
in fresh  resin prior to curing overnight in a 70 ◦C oven. Thin sections,
80 nm  in diameter, were cut using a Leica UCT ultramicrotome and
placed  on 300 mesh thin bar grids. Contrast was applied to the 
sections by adding uranyl acetate followed by Sato’s lead stain. Images
of ZDF  pancreatic islets were captured from random tissue sections
using a  J.E.O.L JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope.
Analysis  of the EM images was completed by a blinded 
investigator  who  had not participated in the animal portion of the
study.  Analysis included calculating the number of insulin granules,
and evaluating the mitochondria quality. Images were analyzed
in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) or Scion Image (Scion
Corp.).  Insulin granules were counted manually within an assigned
area on each micrograph using previously published procedures
[13,14]. The  insulin granules were easily identified by their halo
presentation, making them unique from the other secretory 
granules such as those containing glucagon or somatostatin. The level
59
60
of intact mitochondria was determined using the published 
Mito-chondrial Quality Index [15]. Briefly, individual mitochondria were
assigned one of the following grades: 1 - fully intact, 2 - 
disruption of the cristae (typically from swelling or loss of integrity
of the inner membrane), 3 - disruption of the outer 
mitochon-drial membrane, and 4 - disruption of the cristae and the outer
membrane.
2.5. Immunohistochemistry and immunohistofluorescence
The pancreata were rapidly harvested and fixed in 10% 
normal  buffered formalin using our published protocols [16]. Sections
were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS), 1.0% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), and 0.03% Triton X-100 diluted in 0.1 M
PBS, pH 7.4 for 30 min. Both primary and secondary 
antibodies were diluted in 1% NDS, 1% BSA, and 0.03% Triton X-100.
Slides were  mounted with anti-fading agents Gel/Mount (Biomeda,
Foster City, CA, PA, #M01). The primary antibodies consisted
of: anti-insulin (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,  #ab7842), 
anti-glucagon (1:300, Abcam, #ab10988), anti-somatostatin (1:300,
Abcam, #ab53165) and anti-Ki67 [SP6] proliferation marker (1:100,
Abcam, #ab16667), anti-proinsulin (1:200, Abcam, #ab50805)
and CD34 (1:200, Abcam, #ab812894). Corresponding secondary
antibodies  were conjugated with Dylight 488 (1:400, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, #706-485-
148), Alexa  555 (1:400, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, #A31570),
and Alexa 647 (1:400, Molecular Probes, #A31573). Images were
collected using a Nikon C1Si confocal microscope.
Insulin immunohistochemistry (IHC) was completed on 
paraffin embedded pancreatic tissue using anti-insulin (1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, #sc-9168) and Histostain
Plus Rabbit  Primary (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD,  #85-6143) in 
combination with AEC (3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole) chromogen as a
substrate of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) enzyme. Slides for IHC
were prepared in the same manner as for IF. After the 
permeabil-ization step, a blocking solution was applied. The IHC procedure
was conducted according to the manufacturer instructions.
After staining, the slides were placed on coverslips in 
mounting medium  Clear-Mount with Tris Buffer (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, Hatfield, PA, #17985-12). The specificity of insulin
immunoreactivity was confirmed by omitting the primary 
antibodies from some of the collected sections. The staining was observed
by light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 80i). Images were analyzed with
Ps Adobe Photoshop CZ4 extended software, by determining the
average pixel value of staining per cell or per islet. Background
staining was subtracted from each value.
Islet density was defined as the number of islets per field using a
20× objective. Islet size was estimated by measuring the diameter
of the islet under the software Nikon EZ-C1 3.0 FreeViewer. For the
cell composition analysis, the relative proportion of -, - or -cells
in one islet  was evaluated by counting the number of individual
types of cell and dividing by the total sum of endocrine (,  and )
cells per islet. Gross islet morphology was categorized as either
(1) intact, (2) disrupted or (3) scattered cells. Intact islets were
defined as  having a distinct border with a circular or ellipsoidal
shape. Disrupted islets also contained an identifiable border, but
were missing sections of cells stained for either insulin, glucagon,
or somatostatin. For an islet to be classified as disrupted, at least 25%
of the area had to lack staining for insulin, glucagon or somatostatin.
Scattered cells were defined as fewer than 10 insulin, glucagon, or
somatostatin positive cells in an area. Multiple sequential sections
were analyzed to make sure that a scattered appearance was  not
the tip of an  islet, but truly a small number of endocrine cells alone.
All islet morphology, density, and pixel values were analyzed by a
blinded investigator who did not participate in the in vivo portion
of the study  or in the collection of the images.

2.6. Statistics
A t-test was  used to compare total insulin content. Body weight
and blood glucose data were analyzed using repeated measures
ANOVA. Insulin secretion was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. For
the immunostaining experiments, nested ANOVA was  utilized. All
figures  include means ± SE. p-Value, defined as <0.05, was  
considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Metabolic effects
Over the  9 week course of the study, the body weight of the
diabetic ZDF rats increased over the matched lean animals (Fig. 1A,
p < 0.03). Administration of liraglutide was associated with a body
weight  that was  not statistically different from the lean animals,
and was  less than the vehicle-treated diabetic rats. Blood 
glucose levels  increased in both diabetic groups compared to the lean
non-diabetic controls at each time point tested (Fig. 1B; p < 0.001).
Liraglutide  significantly reduced the blood glucose levels in the
treated  ZDF  rats as compared to the vehicle-treated animals.
At  the termination of the study, glucose tolerance tests were
administered to the liraglutide and vehicle-treated animals. There
was no  difference in the fasting glucose measurements prior to the
initiation of  the experiment (Fig. 1C). However, the blood glucose of
the vehicle-treated animals rose to levels above the detection limits
of the procedure after the glucose injection (at 30 and 60 min). 
During the  same time points, the liraglutide-treated animals had mean
blood  glucose values of 529 ± 50 and 542 ± 51 mg/dl, respectively.
There  was  no difference between groups in the glucose values 2 h
after the injection of glucose.
3.2. Insulin  content
Immunohistochemistry was  used to identify islets from the 
pancreas of each group of rats. Obviously, it was difficult to find intact
islets from  the 2 diabetic groups. The results demonstrated 
differences in  the insulin staining intensity between the 3 groups.
As expected, the non-diabetic lean controls had the most intense
insulin  staining (Fig. 2A), followed by the liraglutide-treated 
animals (Fig. 2C). Pancreatic sections from the vehicle-treated animals
had the least insulin staining (Fig. 2B). The color intensity was
calculated  for individual -cells within the islets and the means
are provided in Fig. 2D. Analysis of proinsulin staining from
immunofluorescence images revealed the highest levels of 
proinsulin in  the  liraglutide-treated rats (pixel intensity units 44.3 ± 3.7)
compared to 37.3 ± 2.1 for the diabetic vehicle-treated rats, and
29.2 ±  3.0 in  the lean controls (p < 0.005).
Consistent with the immunohistochemistry data showing
greater insulin staining, the density of insulin granules in the -cells
of islets from  the liraglutide-treated animals increased as compared
to the  controls. Insulin granules were identified by their hallmark
halo appearance in electron micrographs, illustrated by arrows in
Fig. 3A. The  -cells from the liraglutide-treated animals possessed
a higher density of insulin granules per -cell area than the 
vehicle-treated  animals (Fig. 3B).
Insulin secretion was  measured from isolated islets from the
3 groups in  conditions of 1 mM,  3 mM and 20 mM glucose. Islets
from the lean animals showed a typical response with little 
stimulation  at 3 mM glucose, but a significant increase in insulin release
at 20 mM (Fig. 3C, p < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the
amount of insulin released from the islets of vehicle-injected rats in
response to  20 mM glucose. The liraglutide-treated rats had islets
with a  stimulation index that was not statistically different from



the lean control rats, but was higher than the 3 mM exposure in the
islets from liraglutide-treated rats (p < 0.001).
3.3. Islet morphology
Morphological differences between groups clarify the cellular
changes that occur with diabetes. The lean controls had healthy
appearing -cells with normal islet morphology consisting of 
centrally located -cells and - and -cells on the periphery (Fig. 4A).
This cellular architecture was consistent with 88% of all islets from
the lean controls demonstrating a -cell core pattern (n = 41 islets
from 3 rats). Only 6% of the islets from the diabetic vehicle-treated
rats were organized with the -cell core (n = 113 islets from 4 rats).
Liraglutide did not improve the cellular architecture, because only
T. Schwasinger-Schmidt et al. / Pharmacological Research 76 (2013) 58- 66
1% of the islets from the treated group had -cell cores (n = 71 islets
from 4 rats).
In addition to the location of specific endocrine cell types within
the islets, the overall shape of the islets was altered with diabetes.
In the diabetic animals, the islets often had a disrupted appearance
with large areas in the islet core void of endocrine cells or areas of
scattered endocrine cells amongst exocrine tissue (Fig. 4B and C).
We identified 3 major islet morphology categories: (1) intact, (2)
disrupted and (3) scattered cells. In the lean animals, the 
majority of the islets were intact with approximately 15% classified as
disrupted islets or scattered endocrine cells (Table 1). A 
majority of the islets in the vehicle-treated rats were disrupted, with
entire sections of islets missing endocrine cells as shown in Fig. 4B.
The liraglutide-treated animals had a majority of islets classified as
61
62
T. Schwasinger-Schmidt et al. / Pharmacological Research 76 (2013) 58- 66
either disrupted or scattered cells (Table 1). There was  no statistical
difference between the 2 diabetic groups (vehicle or 
liraglutide-treated) for  any of the classifications compared. However, both
groups were statistically different from the islets obtained from the
non-diabetic lean animals, except for the classification of scattered
endocrine cells.
The disrupted appearance of many of the islets from the 2 
diabetic groups led to questions about the vascularity of the islets
associated with diabetes and liraglutide treatment. Pancreatic 
sections were  stained with CD34 to identify vessels surrounding and
penetrating  the islets. Fig. 4D shows the vessel staining around an
islet from a  lean control rat. The green cells within the islets are

Diabetic liraglutide 12.4 ± 5.5 47.0 ± 7.1 40.4 ± 8.2*
The percentage of intact islets was greatest in the lean, non-diabetic group. Islets
from the two  diabetic groups showed substantial numbers of disrupted islets, in
which the outer capsule of the islet was damaged and lacked a smooth border.
The  percentage of islets with disrupted outer rims was  the same as small clusters of
scattered endocrine cells in the pancreata from liraglutide-treated animals. n = slides

positive for  insulin (-cells) with proinsulin additionally stained in
red/orange. As has been shown in the past, blood vessels appear
to align with the insulin-containing portion of each -cell and
opposite the proinsulin location in the healthy rats [17]. The
vehicle-treated rats had evidence of abundant blood vessels that
penetrated  throughout the islets with a more scattered 
distribution of proinsulin within each cell (Fig. 4E). Liraglutide did not
change  the  appearance or density of blood vessels within the islets
(Fig. 4F). More proinsulin was  located in -cells near blood 
vessels in  the  liraglutide-treated animals than in the vehicle treated
diabetics.
3.4. ˛-Cells  and glucagon content
There was  no significant difference in the percentage of -
cells present in individual islets between groups (68.1 ± 2.5% in
lean controls, 72.8 ± 2.0% in vehicle-treated, and 67.4 ± 3.2% in
liraglutide-treated rats). However, when the total area per 
microscopic field  stained for glucagon was calculated, there was far less
glucagon in  the liraglutide-treated animals than in either of the
other two groups (Fig. 5A). A difference in glucagon staining per
islet could  be due to changes in cell size (hypertrophy or 
atro-phy) or in cell number. To clarify, individual - and -cell numbers
were counted using 40× images and the liraglutide group again
had significantly fewer -cells/field than the other two groups
(Fig. 5B). There was  no difference in the number of -cells/field
(lean = 17.4  ± 5.6; vehicle = 14.2 ± 2.3; liraglutide = 12.3 ± 1.6). The
loss of -cells resulted in an increase in the -cell/-cell ratio
(Fig. 5C). In  addition, the intensity of the glucagon staining within
each -cell  was  significantly lower in the two  diabetic groups 
compared to the  lean controls (Fig. 5D). In -cells, there was significantly
less somatostatin staining in the liraglutide treated cells compared
to the other  two groups (Fig. 5E).
3.5. Cell proliferation
To begin  to identify the mechanisms responsible for the changes
in - to -cell ratios, we identified proliferating cells using Ki67,
a well-characterized nuclear protein essential for proliferation. In
the lean, non-diabetic animals positive Ki67 staining was  present
in 14% of all of the -cells (Table 2). In contrast, only half that many
-cells were proliferating in the vehicle-injected diabetic rats, and
there were  no proliferating -cells in the liraglutide-treated 
animals. In contrast, the percentage of -cells actively proliferating
was higher  in both diabetic groups compared to the non-diabetic
group. The  liraglutide group had lower -cell proliferation rates
than the vehicle-treated rats (Table 2).

Diabetic liraglutide 0.0 ± 0.0 56.6 ± 2.5 56.8 ± 4.7
Positive Ki-67 staining indicated proliferating cells. In the lean, non-diabetic animals
there was a low level of proliferating - or -cells compared to other cells in the islet.
However, in the diabetic, vehicle-administered animals the -cells had a high level
of  proliferation. Administration of liraglutide significantly reduced the proliferating
-cells with no proliferation found in -cells. n = 17 islets from lean rats, 15 diabetic
vehicle rats, and 17 diabetic liraglutide rats.

3.6. Mitochondrial ultrastructure
Given the loss of -cells in the islets of the liraglutide-treated
rats, we  investigated the ultrastructure of these cells. The quality
of the mitochondria, based on EM micrographs, was scored using
the Mitochondrial Quality Index [14]. The sample image of an -
cell from a  lean control rat illustrates healthy mitochondria given
a score of 1  (Fig. 6A). -Cells from vehicle- and liraglutide-treated
animals illustrate mitochondria with scores of 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 6B
and C). In -cells, only the cells from lean control animals had a
predominance of healthy mitochondria with no signs of completely
disrupted mitochondria (Fig. 6D). Cells from the vehicle and 
liraglutide treated  groups had nearly equal numbers of mitochondria in all
4 quality categories. Likewise, in -cells from the lean control 
animals, the majority of mitochondria were completely intact (Fig. 6E).
In contrast,  -cells from the liraglutide-treated animals had a much
63
64
higher percentage of the mitochondria that were completely 
disrupted (score of 4) compared to the vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 6E).
4. Discussion
The results of this study indicate that long-term liraglutide 
treatment reduced weight gain and lowered blood glucose in severely
diabetic ZDF rats. However, an excessive loss of -cells, without a
loss in -cell number, was observed with markedly abnormal islet
morphology. In spite of the bihormonal hypothesis first proposed
by Unger and Orci in 1975 [18], little has been done to explore
the role of the -cell and glucagon secretion with GLP-1 analogs. It
has been known for over 15 years that GLP-1 suppresses glucagon
release [19], and this suppression is not dependent on the increased
insulin secretion stimulated by the compound, as it occurs even
in cultured  -cell lines [9]. Furthermore, the increase in islet size
reported in  some studies with GLP-1 treatment was due to the 
stimulation of -cell proliferation [20], with no observable changes in
other cell types. Liraglutide was shown to increase -cell mass by
increasing the cellular kinetics and suppressing ER stress in db/db
mice after  only 2 weeks of treatment. Our study, conducted for
9 weeks on  severely diabetic rats, showed islets with abnormal
morphology in both the vehicle and liraglutide-treated groups with
excessive loss of -cells in the treated animals.
In ZDF rats, liraglutide has been reported to initially reduce body
weight, but  the animals gained the weight back, so that within 6
T. Schwasinger-Schmidt et al. / Pharmacological Research 76 (2013) 58- 66
weeks of treatment they were statistically heavier than the 
vehicle-treated rats [6]. In our study, 9 weeks of treatment resulted in
a significant decline in weight compared to animals exposed to
vehicle alone, resulting in body weights that were not 
statistically different from the lean controls. Similar consistent losses in
body weight have been identified in db/db mice [21]. In agreement
with our findings, previous studies using ZDF rats and liraglutide
monotherapy noted a decline in blood glucose levels with 
liraglutide, but this reduction did not bring the glucose levels down to
nondiabetic  values [6,22].
The endocrine function of the islet is a delicate balance of both
paracrine, endocrine, neural and possibly vascular communication.
Thus, changes in the cellular equilibrium must be investigated since
they may  ultimately affect the clinical response to chronic 
exposure of high  levels of GLP-1. In another study employing long-term
liraglutide treatment, there was  no increase in the -cell mass or 
Ki-67 staining  in male ZDF rats [22]. In Sturis et al., proliferating -cells
numbers actually dropped with 2 weeks of liraglutide 
administration, but then returned to vehicle levels by week 6 [6]. We  show
a decline in - and -cell proliferation along with a decline in
all cell proliferation in the islets with liraglutide treatment 
compared to the vehicle group, in sharp contrast to the current dogma
concerning  -cell proliferation and GLP-1 analogs. It is important
to note that the greatest reported increase in -cell proliferation
with liraglutide has been in primary monolayer cultures from 
newborn rats [20], and not in vivo studies. Even when there was a
reported increase in proliferating -cells in intact islets in response
to liraglutide, those proliferating cells were still extremely rare
events in both human and rat islets [23,24]. Thus, the exact level
of -cell proliferation in humans in response to liraglutide is still
unclear.
The impact of GLP-1 and its analogs on -cells has been 
uncertain. In isolated rat and human islets, GLP-1 exposure significantly
decreased the content and release of glucagon from -cells [8,25].
While in the  perfused rat pancreas, GLP-1 had no effect on glucagon
release [26]. In humans, liraglutide caused significantly lower
glucagon levels when fasting and following meals [27] especially
protein-rich  meals [28]. In one of the most interesting experiments,
humans were subjected to a step-wise hypoglycemic clamp and
plasma glucagon levels sampled. At both 4 and 5 mM glucose, the
subjects given liraglutide showed significantly less glucagon 
secretion than the placebo group [29,30]. At even lower glucose levels
(down to 2.7 mM)  there was either no effect of liraglutide, or the
liraglutide group actually secreted more glucagon than the placebo
group [30].  However, it is important to note that those tests utilized
acute (30 min) exposures to GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogs (exendin), and
may  not be  relevant to potential changes that could occur with
long-term exposure. A human study of type 2 diabetic patients
administered liraglutide for 12 weeks found a reduction in 
fasting glucagon with all 5 liraglutide doses tested, although statistical
significance  was not reached [4].
Importantly, a recent article describing the effects of long-term
exposure to  GLP determined that there was greater -cell mass
in humans  treated with incretins for more than 1 year compared
to diabetics  on other drugs [31]. The subjects on the incretins had
expanded numbers of glucagon-positive cells lining the pancreatic
ducts associated with increased, but still rare, Ki-67 staining. The
results of this study are at odds with our findings. However, it is
important to note that the human organ donors studied in Butler
et al. were taking sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor (n = 6) and one was
on exenatide. The differences between our findings and the human
study may certainly be due to the aspects unique to ZDF rats, or

may  be drug specific as we only tested the effects of liraglutide.
Further studies are vital to determine the long-term effects of drugs
within the  incretin classification on -cell health and pancreatic
function.
Other human studies on the long-term effects of GLP-1 analogs
have begun  to raise concerns about the safety of this class of drugs
[32,33]. While the majority of the studies have examined 
possible links between the use of another GLP-1 agonist, exendin, likely
because it  has been on the market longer, new reports 
including case studies, indicate a possible link with liraglutide as well
[34-36]. In  the past 2 years, the FDA has issued warnings 
concerning the  use of liraglutide with possible risks of thyroid cancer,
pancreatitis, and lost renal function [37]. Although studying these
complications was not the focus of this study, no obvious signs of
pancreatitis  were noted in the liraglutide-treated animals.
5. Conclusions
This study, along with previous publications, showed that
liraglutide  had positive metabolic effects on the ZDF rat model,
including reduced weight gain and decreased non-fasting blood
glucose levels. However, this study also demonstrates abnormal
islet morphology associated with severe diabetes that was not
reversed by  liraglutide and, in the case of -cell health, was actually
inferior in the treated group. Any hope of stabilizing or 
enhancing islet cell mass or function must be accompanied by studies
that carefully assess islet anatomy and physiology. The relevance
of these findings to humans needs to be investigated, along with
investigations of the mechanism of -cell loss.

Fig.  1.  Metabolic  characteristics.  (A)  Body  weights  for  the  vehicle-treated  animals  were  higher  than  the  lean  non-diabetic  controls  or  the  liraglutide-treated  diabetic  rats 
(p 
<  0.05).  (B)  The  non-fasting  blood  glucose  levels  for  the  2  diabetic  groups  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  the  lean  controls  at  each  time  point  measured  (p  <  0.001).  The 
blood 
glucose  levels  were  lower  in  the  liraglutide-treated  group  compared  to  the  vehicle-treated  group  (p  <  0.02).  (C)  Glucose  tolerance  tests  illustrated  the  rapid  increase 
in 
blood  glucose  levels  after  an  IP  bolus  injection  of  glucose.  In  fact,  the  glucose  meter  reached  its  maximum  detectible  level  within  15  min  of the injection. None of the 
liraglutide-treated animals reached the maximum levels. 

Fig. 2. Cellular insulin levels. (A) Immunohistochemistry of pancreatic sections stained for insulin shows the most intense insulin staining in an islet from a lean non-diabetic 
rat.  (B) Islets from the vehicle-treated animals possessed weak insulin staining. (C) The islets from the  liraglutide-treated animals illustrated more intense immunostaining 
than  the vehicle group. (D) The graph summarizes these findings, showing the insulin intensity/cell with the liraglutide group possessing more insulin/cell than the vehicle- 
treated animals, but statistically less than the non-diabetic lean controls. The graph summarizes analysis  of an average of 22 islets/group from 9 sections. *Difference between 
the  lean controls and the vehicle-treated group (p < 0.001). #Difference between the vehicle- and liraglutide-treated groups (p < 0.05). Scale bar = 100 m for all images. 

Fig. 3. Insulin granules. (A) Micrograph of sample islet cells from a vehicle-treated animal. White arrows indicate insulin granules (magnification = 1500×). (B) Analysis of 
insulin  granule density demonstrated that the 2 diabetic groups had a lower granule density than the lean control animals. An average of 36 islets/group were analyzed from 
3  rats/group (*p < 0.001 and #p < 0.05). (C) The glucose-stimulated insulin release (stimulation index) was measured from isolated islets. The graph summarizes the mean of 
2  independent trials (2-3 replicates). Islets from the lean control animals and the liraglutide-treated group had a significant increase in insulin release in response to 20 mM 
glucose  compared to 3 mM glucose (*p < 0.01). 

Fig. 4. Morphology of islets. (A) Antibody-labeled islets from non-diabetic lean 
control animals illustrated a normal morphology. (B) The islets from the vehicle- 
treated diabetic rats had large areas of missing cells, indicating disrupted islets. (C) 
The pancreatic sections from liraglutide-treated animals appeared similar to the 
vehicle-treated group. Counter staining with DC34 for blood vessels (shown sur- 
rounding the islet) and insulin and proinsulin (staining the islets) from lean controls 
(D), vehicle-treated (E) and liraglutide-treat (F) animals all had similar vascularity 
with less proinsuilin in the 2 diabetic groups (vehicle and liraglutide-treated). Scale 
bar = 100 m for all images. 

Fig. 5. -Cell survival and glucagon content. (A) Analysis of triple stained images confirmed that there was  less glucagon staining when measured as total pixels. An average 
of  7 sections/group were analyzed with 16.2 islets/section (*p  < 0.001). (B) There were fewer glucagon-positive -cells per field. An average of 44 fields from 9 sections/group 
were  analyzed (*p < 0.01). (C) The -cell to -cell ratio was highest in the liraglutide-treated animals. An average of 7 sections/group were analyzed with 16.2 islets/section 
(*p  < 0.05). (D) The intensity of the glucagon staining within each -cell was decreased in the liraglutide-treated animals. An average of 5 sections/group were analyzed with 
35  cells/islet (*p < 0.01). (E) The intensity of the somatostatin immunostaining within each -cell was significantly decreased in the liraglutide-treated animals. An average 
of  8 sections/group were analyzed from 12 cells/islet (*p < 0.001). 

Fig. 6. Mitochondria quality index score. (A) Electron micrographs illustrated the intact mitochondria in an -cell from a lean control animals (black arrows). (B and C) 
Vehicle and liraglutide-treated animals had -cells with disrupted mitochondria with MQI  scores of  2-4 (white arrows). (D) There was  no difference in the MQI  score 
for  -cells between the vehicle and liraglutide-treated groups. Mitochondrial integrity from the lean  controls was significantly higher compared to the other 2 groups 
(p  < 0.001). (E)  -Cell mitochondrial integrity was also greatest in the lean control animals (*p < 0.001).  There were significantly more disrupted mitochondria (score of 4) in 
the  liraglutide-treated animals compared to the vehicle-treated group (#p < 0.001). All images analyzed  were collected at 1500× magnification.
