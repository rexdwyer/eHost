rats

Abstract
Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by fat accumulation in the hepatocyte,
inflammation, liver cell injury, and varying degrees of fibrosis, and can lead to oxidative stress in liver. Here, we
investigated whether Salidroside, a natural phenolic antioxidant product, can protect rat from liver injury during NASH.
Methods: NASH model was established by feeding the male SD rats with high-fat and high-cholesterol diet for
14 weeks. Four groups of male SD rats including, normal diet control group, NASH model group, and Salidroside
treatment group with150mg/kg and 300 mg/kg respectively, were studied. Salidroside was given by oral
administration to NASH in rats from 9 weeks to 14 weeks. At the end of 14 weeks, liver and serum were harvested, and
the liver injury, oxidative stress and histological features were evaluated.
Results: NASH rats exhibited significant increases in the following parameters as compared to normal diet control rats:
fat droplets with foci of inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver. ALT, AST in serum and TG, TC in hepatocyte elevated.
Oxidative responsive genes including CYP2E1 and Nox2 increased. Additionally, NASH model decreased antioxidant
enzymes SOD, GSH, GPX, and CAT in the liver due to their rapid depletion after battling against oxidative stress.
Compared to NASH model group, treatment rats with Salidroside effectively reduced lipid accumulation, inhibited liver
injury in a does-dependent manner. Salidroside treatment restored antioxidant enzyme levels, inhibited expression of
CYP2E1 and Nox2 mRNA in liver, which prevented the initial step of generating free radicals from NASH.
Conclusion: The data presented here show that oral administration of Salidroside prevented liver injury in the NASH
model, likely through exerting antioxidant actions to suppress oxidative stress and the free radical-generating CYP2E1
enzyme, Nox2 in liver.

Background
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive
form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and
features of NASH on liver biopsy include steatosis, 
inflammation and varying degrees of fibrosis [1]. NASH is
associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic
syndrome, and its increasing prevalence and clinical 
severity. Thus it is quickly becoming a significant public
health concern [2].

While a variety of factors are involved in NASH 
development and pathogenesis, it is well-accepted that the 
development of NASH follows a two-hit model [3]. The
“1st Hit” involves excess lipid accumulation in the liver,
which sensitizes the liver to the “2nd Hit”. The “2nd Hit”
involves inflammation, oxidative stress, liver damage and
fibrosis. This two-hit hypothesis is helpful in 
understanding processes that contribute to development and 
progression of NASH, the risk factors and underlying cellular and
molecular mechanisms in NASH development remain
largely undefined, which has limited the development of
therapies to prevent/treat NAFLD/NASH.
Oxidative stress is thought to be a major contributor to
the pathogenesis and progression of NASH [4]. Oxidative

stress has been defined as an imbalance between oxidants
and antioxidants in favor of the former, resulting in an
overall increase in cellular levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [5]. In patients with histopathologically progressive
NASH, production of antioxidants is reduced, and the
total antioxidant capacity is apparently insufficient to
compensate for oxidative stress [6]. Therefore, it is 
speculated that agents, such as vitamin E, that promote cellular
antioxidant defense activity are likely to have therapeutic
potentials in NASH prevention/treatment [7].
Salidroside (SDS, p-hydroxyphenethyl-b-D-glucoside)
is a natural phenolic secondary metabolite from Rhodiola
rosea L, which has been used as a herbal medicine for 
centuries. Salidroside, in particular, has potent antioxidation
activities [8, 9]. Moreover, recent studies have shown that
SDS has a great protective efficacy on liver disease via its
antioxidant activities [10-12]. However, whether SDS can
provide protection against NASH with oxidative stress 
remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we used a liver
oxidative stress model induced by high-fat and 
high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet in rats and evaluated the 
protective effects of SDS on NASH.
Materials
Reagents
Salidroside [purity > 98] was provided by Sciphar Hi-tech
Industry Co., Ltd, Shanxi, China, and were diluted in 
distilled water before use. High-fat and high-cholesterol
(HFHC) diet (containing 15 % lard, 2 % cholesterol and
83 % normal diet) was provided by Department of 
Digestive Physiology at Dalian Medical University. Triglycerides
(TG), Total cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA),
glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD),
glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) commercial
testing kits were bought from JianCheng Bioengineering
Institute, Nanjing, China.
Methods
Male SD rats, weighing 140-160 g, 6 weeks of age, were
provided by the Laboratory Animal Center at Dalian
Medical University. Rats were housed individually. A
normal laboratory diet and water were available ad 
libitum. The animal room was maintained at constant
temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and 50 % relative humidity with
a 12 h (7:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.) light/dark cycle. Food was
removed the night before the experiment. All 
experimental procedures were examined and approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Dalian Medical 
University (Dalian, China) and performed in strict 
accordance with the People’s Republic of China Legislation
Regarding the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals.
After 1 week on the normal diet, 40 animals were randomly
divided into 4 groups:normal diet control rats (n = 10): rats
were fed with normal diet for 14 weeks; NASH model
group (n = 10): rats were fed with HFHC diet for 14 weeks;
SDS-treated rats (n = 10, two groups): rats were fed with
HFHC diet for 14 weeks with a daily oral feeding of SDS
150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg respectively by intragastric (i.g.)
gavage from 9 weeks to 14 weeks. After the end of 14 weeks,
all rats were anesthetized at 24 h after the last treatment.
Blood was collected by cervical decapitation and 
centrifuged at 1500 g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain serum. Liver
tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS buffer and 
centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate the
insoluble material, and the supernatant was used in the
following assays.
Evaluation of liver pathology
Liver tissue sample from each rat were fixed in 10 %
phosphate-buffered formalin, and then embedded in 
paraffin blocks. Five-micrometer tissue sections were cut
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for 
histo-logical analysis (NAS scoring) [13] under light microscope
(Nikon, Japan). Briefly, the NAS score was aggregated
from 4 semi-quantitative sub-scores: steatosis (0-3), 
lobular inflammation (0-2), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2),
and fibrosis (0-4).
Serum biochemical test
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) in serum were used as indicators of
hepatocyte function and injury. ALT and AST levels
were measured by a Bayer 1650 automatic analyzer
(Germany).
Triglyceride, total cholesterol detection in hepatocytes
For the determination of total cholesterol and triglycerides,
liver samples (100 mg) were homogenized, and lipids were
extracted with 2 ml of chloroform and methanol (2:1), as
described by Folch et al [14]. Lipids were dissolved in 2 %
Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), as described by Carr
et al [15]. Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels were
determined using commercially available reagents.
Lipid peroxidation and antioxidative enzyme activity in
liver
Malondialdehyde (MDA) and the enzymatic activities of
superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX),
glutathione (GSH) as well as catalase (CAT) in liver were
measured using commercial testing kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. MDA and GSH levels are
expressed as nmol/mg protein and mg/g protein, 
respectively. The enzymatic activity of the SOD, GPX,
and CAT are expressed as U/mg protein.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis
CYP2E1 and NOX2 mRNA expression were tested by
Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was extracted
Yang et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:16 Page 3 of 6
from liver tissue samples by the TRIzol kit (Gibco/Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The RNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using
the Super-Script II (Invitrogen) and the target genes
were amplified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems). The amplification
was performed in real-time PCR system (Applied 
Biosys-tems) and a modified PCR cycles were used as following:
initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 
cycles were performed at 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s.
The housekeeping gene β-actin was used as an internal
control, and gene-specific mRNA expression was 
normalized agains β-actin expression. Relative quantification
by the 2−ΔΔCT method was realized by comparing to
control groups (The sequences for the primers used for

All statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 
software (version 11.0, SPSS, Inc.).
Results
Treatment with SDS prevents NASH-liver injury and
steatosis
To study the protective effects of SDS, we established a
HFHC diet-induced NASH rats model. As shown in
Fig. 1, liver steatosis that affected a large number of 
he-patocytes with foci of inflammatory cell infiltration
throughout the lobule (arrow) was observed in H&E
stained liver sections from HFHC diet rats. In contrast,
the liver sections were normal from normal control rats
(Fig. 1a, b). Also, significantly increased serum ALT,
AST (Fig. 2a, b) and liver TG, TC were detected in
HFHC diet rats (Fig. 2c, d). These results indicate that a
three-weeks HFHC diet feeding sufficiently induced
NASH in rats. Importantly, compared to NASH model
group, a dramatic reduction both in lipid droplets and in
the inflammatory infiltration were detected in the liver
from SDS-treated group (Fig. 1c). Consistent to the 
observations from H&E staining, the average NASH scores
were significantly reduced in HFHC diet rats (Fig. 1d).
In addition, the levels of ALT, AST in the serum and
TG, TC in the hepatocyte also decreased in the 
SDS-treated group when compared with those in the NASH
model group, and SDS inhibited the levels of ALT, AST,
TG and TC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a-d).
These results demonstrate that SDS is an potential agent
for prevention of rat from HFHC diet -induced NASH.
SDS suppress liver injury-induced oxidative stress
mediators
The imbalance between oxidative and anti-oxidative stress
response has been well accepted as a critical pathogenic
factor for NASH development. As SDS has an 
antioxidative activity, we speculated that SDS may protect rat from
NASH through this antioxidative function. To test this 
hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of antioxidation
enzymes. HFHC diet feeding resulted in a significant 
increase in MDA level, and largely decreased the 
antioxidation enzymes including SOD, GSH, GPX, and CAT in the
liver as compared to the normal controls (Table 1). 
Similarly, the mRNA levels of CYP2E1 (Fig. 3a) and Nox2
(Fig. 3b) were also increased in HFHC diet rats liver. 
Interestingly, compared to untreated HFHC diet group, the
SDS treatment significantly reduced MDA and increased
SOD, GSH, GPX, and CAT levels in a dose dependent
manner. Further analysis indicated that SDS 
dose-dependently suppressed CYP2E1 and Nox2 mRNA 
expression in the liver. Therefore, these results suggest
that SDS can protect rat from NASH through inhibiting
the liver oxidative stress.
Discussion
Our preclinical studies demonstrated that SDS protects
rat from HFHC diet -induced NASH through 
suppressing the oxidative stress-induced liver damages, as 
evidenced by the results that SDS significantly reduced the
increased MDA and increased the suppressed 
antioxidation enzymes, like SOD, GSH, GPX, and CAT, in the
NASH-injured liver. At the same time, SDS significantly
reduced the increased CYP2E1and Nox2 mRNA 
expression in the liver. These results suggest that SDS can 
protect the liver from NASH-induced injury, which is most
likely to take place through the inhibition of oxidative
stress mediators. In this experiment, rats were treated by
oral administration of salidroside from 9 weeks to
14 weeks. By the ninth week, mild to moderate 
pathology should be estabilished. Therefore, salidroside can
recover the severe pathology after the full development
of the pathology.
Oxidative stress is significantly closely associated with
NASH. Antioxidants can ameliorate the development of
NASH formation [16]. The current work revealed that
SDS rendered the increased CYP2E1 less pronounced in
Yang et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2016) 17:16 Page 5 of 6
injured liver with NASH in rats. The CYP2E1 enzyme is
a hepatic cytochrome P450 isoform, which create free
radicals in phase I enzymes [17]. CYP2E1 is critically 
important in NASH development by promoting oxidative,
inflammation. CYP2E1 overexpression results in 
increased oxidative stress and nitrosative stress in mouse
model of non-alcoholic fatty liver [18]. But CYP2E1-null
mice can prevent NASH progression [19]. The fact that
SDS can prevent the upregulation of the cytochrome
P450 enzyme CYP2E1 suggests that SDS exert 
hepato-protection by acting early in the process of oxidative
stress, which is probably capable of blocking the entire
(Data are mean + SD, n = 10 per group. ##P < 0.01 compared to normal
control; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared to NASH model)
inflammation. However, the precise celluar and 
molecular mechanisms by which SDS bind to targets upstream
of CYP2E1 remains to be elucidated.
The results of the current study also revealed that SDS
treatment reduced the rate of upregulation of Nox2
mRNA expression in the NASH rat model. Nox2 is a
membrane-bound enzyme complex. It has been shown
to be involved in cellular respiratory bursts and free
radical production in a variety of cells, including 
hepa-tocytes [20]. Nox-2-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS)
may be involved in the activation of inflammatory 
apop-totic pathways. NOX2-generated oxidative stress is 
associated with severity of liver steatosis in patients with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [21]. For this reason,
Nox2 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic 
target to reduce ROS-related injury, such as 
ischemia-reperfusion associated liver injury. It has been reported
that NO donor KMUP-1 improves hepatic 
ischemia-reperfusion and hypoxic cell injury by inhibiting 
Nox2-and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated 
inflammation [22].
The CYP pathway is known to be coupled with the NOX
pathway [23, 24]. The increased expression of CYP2E1
leads to the generation of more free electrons, which is
coupled with the conversion of NADPH to NADP+ via
Nox2 and/or Nox4. The CYP2E1 reaction cycle produces
ROS as a result of uncoupling of the reaction. In addition,
Nox2 and Nox4 may promote the recycling of NADP+ to
produce superoxides and peroxides, which can further
result in the generation of peroxides and ROS through
the Fenton chemistry. These CYP2E1/NOX2-coupled
reactions increase the caspase-3 activity, induce DNA
fragmentation, and ultimately result in the apoptosis in
liver tissues [20]. This is characterized by NASH-in-
duced steatosis in liver. In this way, the Nox2 pathway is
another therapeutic target for diseases that involve 
oxidative stress [25, 26]. The current results demonstrated that
SDS can suppress the increased CYP2E1 and Nox2 
expression, suggesting that SDS may exert the 
hepatoprotec-tive effect through inhibition of the CYP2E1/Nox2 coupling
reaction, reducing oxidative stress, and ameliorating liver 
injury caused by NASH. This is the first report to show that
SDS prevent NASH via this mechanism of action.

Conclusions
In summary, the current work provides evidence that
SDS can prevent liver injury and steatosis in NASH rats
by inhibiting oxidative stress. The action probably 
involves SDS exerting antioxidant actions and the 
inhibition of free radical-generating CYP2E1/Nox pathway.
Although the research have no the highest dose normal
control group, literature demonstrated that the dose
(150 and 300 mg/kg SDS) used in this study did not
pose genotoxic effect in vivo and in vitro [27].
