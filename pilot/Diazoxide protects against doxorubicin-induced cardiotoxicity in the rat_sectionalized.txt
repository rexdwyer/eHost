>>>section: conclusion
Conclusion
The main observation in the present results is that 
pre-treatment with diazoxide attenuates doxorubicin-induced
cardiac contractile dysfunction, and attenuates release of
biomarkers of cardiotoxicity in effluate without 
decreasing the accumulation of doxorubicin. 5-HD completely
abolished this effect of diazoxide in our rat model. A 
possible mechanism could be opening of mitochondrial
KATP-channels. However, we cannot exclude other effects
of the drug, including opening of vascular KATP-channels.
The low specificity of 5-HD, calls for additional studies of
mechanisms of a promising protective intervention.

Methods
Materials
Doxorubicin was purchased from Meda AS (Slemmestad,
Norway), diazoxide, 5-hydroxydecanoate and pentobarbital
from Haukeland Hospital Pharmacy (Bergen, Norway),
heparin from Leo Pharma A/S (Oslo, Norway), and 
ingredients for the Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer from
Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). This study conforms
Page 2 of 8
to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by
the Animal Care and User Committee in Norway with
document number: ID 1766 FOTS, and certified institution
number 066 Vivarium, University of Bergen.
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 200 ± 20 grams were 
purchased from Taconic (Ejby, Denmark). The animals were
housed in grid-bottom metal wire cages in a room 
maintained at a 12 hour light/dark cycle at a temperature of
20-22°C. They were acclimatised for two weeks, housed
three per cage and allowed free access to food pellets
(Pellets rodent, Special Diets Services, Essex, UK) and
tap water until i.p. injection of diazoxide, 5-HD, saline
or doxorubicin. The animals were separated in individual
cages based on their respective treatment protocols.
Langendorff perfusion model
The perfusion medium was a modified, oxygenated
(95% O2 and 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate 
buffer (KHBB) (pH 7.4) containing in mM: 118.5 NaCl,
25.0 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.0
D-glucose, and 1.25 CaCl2. Hearts were excised after 
anaesthesia of the rats with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital
50 mg/kg (0.1 ml/100 g bodyweight) and heparinised i.p.
(0.1 ml 500 IU/100 g bodyweight). Anaesthesia was
evaluated by the pedal-withdrawal reflex. The heart was
rapidly excised and immediately placed in cold (4°C)
KHBB to temporarily stop its beating and preserve it
from ischemic injury prior to perfusion. The heart was
mounted on a steel cannula placed in the aorta and
perfused retrogradely in a Langendorff system with the
use of thermostated (37°C) reservoirs (Lauda, 
Lauda-Königshofen, Germany), perfusion lines and heart 
chamber. Pressure regulated flow was performed at 100 cmH2O
(73 mmHg), while volume regulated flow (12.5 ml/min)
was performed by use of an Alitea peristaltic pump (Alitea,
Stockholm, Sweden). A water-filled latex balloon was
placed in the left ventricle and connected to a pressure
transducer (Memscap AS, Skoppum, Norway) for the
recording of left ventricular pressure (LVDP) and 
secondarily derived contractility indices. Left ventricular 
end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was adjusted between 4 and
8 mmHg. A second pressure transducer was connected
to a side arm on the aortic cannula for the recording of
aortic pressure (AoP), an index of coronary vascular 
resistance during volume-regulated perfusion. Pressure
signals were amplified (Quadbridge, AD Instruments,
London, UK) and recorded using a PowerLab data 
acquisition system (AD Instruments, East Sussex, UK). AoP, LVDP,
LVEDP, left ventricular pressure first derivatives maximum
(dp/dtmax) and minimum (dp/dtmin) were continuously

displayed and recorded. Pacing (300 beats per minute by
electric stimulation of 5 V amplitude of 3 ms duration)
was obtained by placing one electrode on the right 
auricle and one on the steel cannula. Pacing was used to
maintain a standard contractile response to the 
experimental drugs in the model not influenced by changes in
heart rate and/or periods of arrhythmia. Coronary flow
rate was measured by timed collection of the coronary
perfusate that dripped from the heart. At the end of
the perfusion protocol, hearts were removed from the
Langendorff system and myocardial tissue from the left
ventricle was dissected free and immediately frozen in
liquid helium and stored at −80°C until analysis of 
doxorubicin and doxorubicinol was performed, within 14 days
of termination of the perfusion protocol. Effluent samples
of 1 mL were collected in 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf
micro test tubes (Eppendorf Vertrieb, Wesseling-Berzdorf,
Germany) from each heart, at the end of the perfusion
protocol, and stored at 0°C, until analysis for TnT within
4 days of termination of the perfusion protocol. Effluent
samples of 1 mL were collected in Eppendorf tubes from
each heart at the end of the perfusion protocol, placed in a
thermostated (37°C) Eppendorf rack heated by a Lauda
reservoir (Lauda, Königshofen, Germany), and immediately
analysed for H2O2. All experiments and analysis were 
carried out between 7 am and 7 pm.

protocol: 15 minutes stabilisation period with pressure-regulated
flow, followed by 5 minutes with pressure-regulated flow
and 5 minutes with volume-regulated flow. During the
latter 10 minutes physiological data were recorded, and
cardiac effluent samples collected for the evaluation of 
biochemical and pharmacological parameters. The perfusion
protocol is illustrated in Figure 2.

Quantification of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol
Doxorubicin and doxorubicinol were quantified by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS)
(1200 series RRLC, Agilent Technologies, USA) coupled to
an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using
positive electrospray ionisation (Agilent Technologies,
USA). Frozen left ventricular tissue was minced and
weighted out in a glass tube with a screw cap and 
homogenized in physiological saline (2 ml/100 mg tissue)
with a tissue homogenizer (Ultra Turrax, Sigma Aldrich,
Germany). 1000 μl of sample was added 100 μl of 
dauno-rubicin as internal standard (IS), and 200 μl of buffer
(1 M TRIZMA, pH 11.1) and mixed well before 
extraction with 4 ml ethylacetate/heptane (80/20 vol/vol). The
samples were mixed using a rotary blender for 15 minutes
and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 10°C.
The organic phase was evaporated to dryness at 50°C
under nitrogen then dissolved in 100 μl of methanol
followed by 100 μl of distilled water. The extract was
mixed thoroughly and transferred to silanized vials before
analysis. 25 μl of extract was injected and separated on a
Zorbax SB-Aq (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.8 μm particles, Agilent
Technologies, USA) column using gradient elution with
acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. 
Quantifi-cation was performed using multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode at m/z 546.1→ 363.1 for doxorubicinol, m/z
544.1→ 361.1 for doxorubicin and m/z 528.1→ 321.1 for
daunorubicin (IS).
Effluent content of H2O2
H2O2 in cardiac effluent was measured using an Apollo
4000 electrochemical detection system (World Precision
Instruments, Sarasota, Florida, USA). The electrode was
calibrated using 9 serial dilutions of H2O2 in phosphate
buffered saline with added aniline. The current recorded
from the effluent was then calculated as μM H2O2.
Samples were kept at 37°C during measurement. The 
electrode was allowed 3 minutes of stabilisation and 1 minute
of recording.
Effluent content of TnT
TnT in cardiac effluent was measured using an Elecsys
2010 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Norway
AS, Oslo, Norway), based on the sandwich principle.
Total duration of assay: 9 minutes. 1st incubation:
50 μL of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal cardiac 
TnT-specific antibody, and a monoclonal cardiac TnT-specific
antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex (Tris(2,2-
bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex (Ru(bpy))) reacted to
form a sandwich complex. 2nd incubation: After addition
of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex became
bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture was aspirated into the
measuring cell where the microparticles were magnetically
Page 4 of 8
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound 
substances were then removed with ProCell. Application of a
voltage to the electrode then induced chemiluminescent
emission which was measured by a photomultiplier. 
Results were determined via a calibration curve which was
instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration
and a master curve (5-point calibration) provided via the
reagent barcode. Detection limit was 5.0 ng/L.
Statistics
All results are reported as mean values ± standard 
deviation (SD) in tables. Groups were compared with regards
to parameters with a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and subsequently Fisher’s protected 
least-significant difference test. SPSS for Windows version
17.0 was used and p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Diazoxide protects against doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity in the rat
Lisa Drange Hole1*, Terje Hjalmar Larsen2,3, Kjell Ove Fossan1, Fredrik Limé1 and Jan Schjøtt1,4
Abstract
Aim: Chemotherapy with doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxicity. Free radical generation and mitochondrial dysfunction
are thought to contribute to doxorubicin-induced cardiac failure. In this study we wanted to investigate if opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels by diazoxide is protective against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and if 5-hydroxydecanoate
(5-HD), a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel antagonist, abolished any protection by this intervention.
Methods: Wistar rats were divided into 7 groups (n = 6) and followed for 10 days with 5 intervention groups including
the following treatments: (1) Diazoxide and doxorubicin, (2) diazoxide and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), (3) 5-HD and
doxorubicin, (4) diazoxide and saline and (5) 5-HD and saline. On day 1, 3, 5 and 7 the animals received intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injections with 10 mg/kg diazoxide and/or 40 mg/kg 5-HD, 30 minutes before i.p. injections with 3.0 mg/kg
doxorubicin. One control group received only saline injections and the other control group received saline 30 minutes
prior to 3.0 mg/kg doxorubicin. On day 10 the hearts were excised and Langendorff-perfused. Cardiac function was
assessed by an intraventricular balloon and biochemical effects by release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and troponin-T
(TnT) in effluate from the isolated hearts, and by myocardial content of doxorubicin.
Results: Doxorubicin treatment produced a significant loss in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (p < 0.05) and
an increase in both H2O2 and TnT release in effluate (p < 0.05). Diazoxide significantly attenuated the decrease in LVDP
(p < 0.05) and abolished the increased release of H2O2 and TnT (p < 0.05). 5-HD abolished the effects of pretreatment
with diazoxide, and these effects were not associated with reduced myocardial accumulation of doxorubicin.
Conclusions: Pretreatment with diazoxide attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in the rat, measured by
physiological indices and TnT and H2O2 in effluate from isolated hearts. The effect could be mediated by opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels, reduced doxorubicin-associated free radical generation and decreased cardiomyocyte
damage. Diazoxide represents a promising protective intervention against doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.

Background
Doxorubicin is a widely used chemotherapy drug, but its
application is associated with cardiotoxicity. Free radical
generation and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought
to contribute to doxorubicin-induced cardiac failure [1,2].
Dose reduction protocols have been proposed to avoid the
risk of delayed cardiotoxicity, but this might be at the
expense of the anticancer effect [3]. In addition, 
impaired calcium handling and cellular damage mediated

by reactive oxygen species, have been proposed as toxic
mechanisms to explain both acute and delayed 
cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines [4-6].
Diazoxide has been in clinical use since the early
1960’s to treat severe non-malignant and malignant
hypertension in hospitalized adults and acute severe
hypertension in hospitalized children. Diazoxide is also
used to treat hypoglycaemia. The mechanisms of 
diazox-ide’s clinical action relate predominantly to the opening
of pancreatic and smooth muscle KATP-channels [7].

cardioprotection by mechanisms that open the mitochondrial*

preconditioning [8]. Pharmacological preconditioning,
mimicking ischemic preconditioning, is suggested as an
intervention to reduce doxorubicin cardiotoxicity [9].
Morphine has been demonstrated to mimic 
preconditioning in cardiomyocytes [10,11]. We have previously
observed increased mortality in rats pretreated in vivo
with morphine before doxorubicin (32). In a follow-up
study we pretreated rats with morphine, isolated the
hearts and exposed them to doxorubicin in a Langendorff
perfusion system (unpublished data). We found that 
pretreatment with morphine in vivo was associated with a
cardiodepressive effect in isolated hearts before 
doxorubicin exposure. After exposure to doxorubicin ex vivo,
isolated hearts from rats pretreated with morphine were
associated with increased release of hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), increased release of troponin-T (TnT), increased
myocardial contracture and increased myocardial content
of doxorubicin. These findings were in contrary to results
from a comparable study [9] which found that morphine
was protective against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Based
on these opposing results we wanted to investigate 
further, whether pharmacological preconditioning could 
reduce doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.
Direct stimulation of myocardial δ1-opioid receptors
leads to opening of mitochondrial KATP-channels and a
resultant increase in intracellular free radical signals
in vitro [10]. Recently, nicorandil, a mitochondrial 
KATP-channel opener, has successfully been administered to
counteract the toxic effects of doxorubicin [12,13]. In
light of our previous results, we now wanted to bypass
the opioid receptors in this experiment, and study how
direct opening of mitochondrial KATP-channels interacts
with the cardiotoxic mechanisms of anthracyclines. We
used diazoxide, a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel
agonist, known to have protective properties against 
cardiac ischemia [7,14]. We also used 5-hydroxydecanoate
(5-HD), a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel 
antagonist. 5-HD inhibits the increase in free radicals seen
with δ1-opioid receptor activation, and abolishes 
cardioprotection afforded by ischemic preconditioning [7]. Our
model combines drug treatment in vivo with the study of
hearts ex vivo, yielding direct physiological information on
systolic and diastolic cardiac function combined with 
biochemical indices like H2O2, TnTand measurement of 
myocardial content of doxorubicin.

Norway), diazoxide, 5-hydroxydecanoate and pentobarbital
from Haukeland Hospital Pharmacy (Bergen, Norway),
heparin from Leo Pharma A/S (Oslo, Norway), and 
ingredients for the Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer from
Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). This study conforms
Page 2 of 8
to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by
the Animal Care and User Committee in Norway with
document number: ID 1766 FOTS, and certified institution
number 066 Vivarium, University of Bergen.
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 200 ± 20 grams were 
purchased from Taconic (Ejby, Denmark). The animals were
housed in grid-bottom metal wire cages in a room 
maintained at a 12 hour light/dark cycle at a temperature of
20-22°C. They were acclimatised for two weeks, housed
three per cage and allowed free access to food pellets
(Pellets rodent, Special Diets Services, Essex, UK) and
tap water until i.p. injection of diazoxide, 5-HD, saline
or doxorubicin. The animals were separated in individual
cages based on their respective treatment protocols.
Langendorff perfusion model
The perfusion medium was a modified, oxygenated
(95% O2 and 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate 
buffer (KHBB) (pH 7.4) containing in mM: 118.5 NaCl,
25.0 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.0
D-glucose, and 1.25 CaCl2. Hearts were excised after 
anaesthesia of the rats with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital
50 mg/kg (0.1 ml/100 g bodyweight) and heparinised i.p.
(0.1 ml 500 IU/100 g bodyweight). Anaesthesia was
evaluated by the pedal-withdrawal reflex. The heart was
rapidly excised and immediately placed in cold (4°C)
KHBB to temporarily stop its beating and preserve it
from ischemic injury prior to perfusion. The heart was
mounted on a steel cannula placed in the aorta and
perfused retrogradely in a Langendorff system with the
use of thermostated (37°C) reservoirs (Lauda, 
Lauda-Königshofen, Germany), perfusion lines and heart 
chamber. Pressure regulated flow was performed at 100 cmH2O
(73 mmHg), while volume regulated flow (12.5 ml/min)
was performed by use of an Alitea peristaltic pump (Alitea,
Stockholm, Sweden). A water-filled latex balloon was
placed in the left ventricle and connected to a pressure
transducer (Memscap AS, Skoppum, Norway) for the
recording of left ventricular pressure (LVDP) and 
secondarily derived contractility indices. Left ventricular 
end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was adjusted between 4 and
8 mmHg. A second pressure transducer was connected
to a side arm on the aortic cannula for the recording of
aortic pressure (AoP), an index of coronary vascular 
resistance during volume-regulated perfusion. Pressure
signals were amplified (Quadbridge, AD Instruments,
London, UK) and recorded using a PowerLab data 
acquisition system (AD Instruments, East Sussex, UK). AoP, LVDP,
LVEDP, left ventricular pressure first derivatives maximum
(dp/dtmax) and minimum (dp/dtmin) were continuously

displayed and recorded. Pacing (300 beats per minute by
electric stimulation of 5 V amplitude of 3 ms duration)
was obtained by placing one electrode on the right 
auricle and one on the steel cannula. Pacing was used to
maintain a standard contractile response to the 
experimental drugs in the model not influenced by changes in
heart rate and/or periods of arrhythmia. Coronary flow
rate was measured by timed collection of the coronary
perfusate that dripped from the heart. At the end of
the perfusion protocol, hearts were removed from the
Langendorff system and myocardial tissue from the left
ventricle was dissected free and immediately frozen in
liquid helium and stored at −80°C until analysis of 
doxorubicin and doxorubicinol was performed, within 14 days
of termination of the perfusion protocol. Effluent samples
of 1 mL were collected in 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf
micro test tubes (Eppendorf Vertrieb, Wesseling-Berzdorf,
Germany) from each heart, at the end of the perfusion
protocol, and stored at 0°C, until analysis for TnT within
4 days of termination of the perfusion protocol. Effluent
samples of 1 mL were collected in Eppendorf tubes from
each heart at the end of the perfusion protocol, placed in a
thermostated (37°C) Eppendorf rack heated by a Lauda
reservoir (Lauda, Königshofen, Germany), and immediately
analysed for H2O2. All experiments and analysis were 
carried out between 7 am and 7 pm.

Quantification of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol
Doxorubicin and doxorubicinol were quantified by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS)
(1200 series RRLC, Agilent Technologies, USA) coupled to
an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using
positive electrospray ionisation (Agilent Technologies,
USA). Frozen left ventricular tissue was minced and
weighted out in a glass tube with a screw cap and 
homogenized in physiological saline (2 ml/100 mg tissue)
with a tissue homogenizer (Ultra Turrax, Sigma Aldrich,
Germany). 1000 μl of sample was added 100 μl of 
daunorubicin as internal standard (IS), and 200 μl of buffer
(1 M TRIZMA, pH 11.1) and mixed well before 
extraction with 4 ml ethylacetate/heptane (80/20 vol/vol). The
samples were mixed using a rotary blender for 15 minutes
and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 10°C.
The organic phase was evaporated to dryness at 50°C
under nitrogen then dissolved in 100 μl of methanol
followed by 100 μl of distilled water. The extract was
mixed thoroughly and transferred to silanized vials before
analysis. 25 μl of extract was injected and separated on a
Zorbax SB-Aq (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.8 μm particles, Agilent
Technologies, USA) column using gradient elution with
acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. 
Quantifi-cation was performed using multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode at m/z 546.1→ 363.1 for doxorubicinol, m/z
544.1→ 361.1 for doxorubicin and m/z 528.1→ 321.1 for
daunorubicin (IS).
Effluent content of H2O2
H2O2 in cardiac effluent was measured using an Apollo
4000 electrochemical detection system (World Precision
Instruments, Sarasota, Florida, USA). The electrode was
calibrated using 9 serial dilutions of H2O2 in phosphate
buffered saline with added aniline. The current recorded
from the effluent was then calculated as μM H2O2.
Samples were kept at 37°C during measurement. The 
electrode was allowed 3 minutes of stabilisation and 1 minute
of recording.
Effluent content of TnT
TnT in cardiac effluent was measured using an Elecsys
2010 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Norway
AS, Oslo, Norway), based on the sandwich principle.
Total duration of assay: 9 minutes. 1st incubation:
50 μL of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal cardiac 
TnT-specific antibody, and a monoclonal cardiac TnT-specific
antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex (Tris(2,2-
bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex (Ru(bpy))) reacted to
form a sandwich complex. 2nd incubation: After addition
of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex became
bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture was aspirated into the
measuring cell where the microparticles were magnetically
Page 4 of 8
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound 
substances were then removed with ProCell. Application of a
voltage to the electrode then induced chemiluminescent
emission which was measured by a photomultiplier. 
Results were determined via a calibration curve which was
instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration
and a master curve (5-point calibration) provided via the
reagent barcode. Detection limit was 5.0 ng/L.
Statistics
All results are reported as mean values ± standard 
deviation (SD) in tables. Groups were compared with regards
to parameters with a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and subsequently Fisher’s protected 
least-significant difference test. SPSS for Windows version
17.0 was used and p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Discussion
Pretreatment with diazoxide attenuated 
doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in the rat in the present
study. Doxorubicin treatment produced a significant loss
in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (p < 0.05)
both in volume- and pressure regulated perfusion similar
to previous reports [15,16]. Diazoxide significantly 
attenuated this decrease in LVDP (p < 0.05) in both perfusion
protocols. Diazoxide also improved diastolic dysfunction
in doxorubicin treated hearts, by lowering the elevation
of LVEDP (p < 0.05) in both perfusion protocols, 
compared to animals that received both diazoxide and 5-HD.
The protective effect of diazoxide is equivalent to that of
ischemic preconditioning, and diazoxide is often used as
a pharmacological means to induce preconditioning [7].
The drug has previously been described as an agent with
a unique molecular target by opening of 
mitochondrial KATP-channels in cardioprotection. However, more

recently a consensus seems to emerge that there are 
numerous effectors involved in the cardioprotective effects of
diazoxide, and these effectors may synergistically 
contribute to its cardioprotective properties [7].
With volume regulated flow, the effects on 
doxorubicin-induced coronary vascular resistance, can be studied in
parallel with effects on myocardial contractility. During
volume regulated perfusion, aortic pressure, an indirect
measure of coronary resistance, was increased in hearts
that received both diazoxide and 5-HD, or just 5-HD, 
before doxorubicin. However, diazoxide pretreatment 
attenuated this effect. The vasodilatory effects of diazoxide in
vascular smooth muscle are due to opening of vascular
KATP-channels. KATP-channels have a pronounced role in
controlling coronary blood flow and the coronary reserve,
particularly in the resistance arterioles [17]. In some studies
diazoxide has been noted to improve coronary flow, which
is associated with cardioprotection, in perfused hearts [18],
despite the fact that the coronary flow reserve is low in
crystalloid-perfused hearts [19]. Coronary flow was 
significantly higher (p < 0.05) in DIADOX compared to
SALDOX during pressure regulated perfusion. This 
effect was abolished with 5-HD. Based on these results,
improved cardiac function associated with preserved 
coronary flow during pressure regulated perfusion, and 
attenuated increase in aortic pressure during volume regulated
perfusion, could account for some of the cardioprotective
effects of diazoxide.

of H2O2 in cardiac effluate compared to hearts that were
pretreated with 5-HD and diazoxide or 5-HD alone.
Diazoxide is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex
II protein, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This 
inhibition also occurs in the heart [20]. The activity of SDH is
a site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and
the possibility has been raised that diazoxide and other
SDH inhibitors mediate some of their cardioprotective
effects via modulation of ROS production. Which ROS
signals cardioprotection is mediated through is not fully
understood [8]. Opening of mitochondrial KATP-chan-
nels leads to increased ROS, leading to a persistent open
state of the channel. The ROS responsible for this is not
known [7]. H2O2 has been proposed as one candidate
for this effect, although one study concludes that H2O2
is not the mediator of mitochondrial KATP-channel-
dependent ROS signalling [8]. In our study we found
higher levels of H2O2 in effluate from hearts that had
not undergone diazoxide pretreatment before 
doxorubicin, or that had received both 5-HD and diazoxide
before doxorubicin. The level of H2O2 associated with
cellular signalling is much lower than the levels 
associated with cardiotoxicity [21]. The present study was not
designed to examine signalling effects, and our 
observations are thus associated with the reduced cardiotoxicity
of doxorubicin. This is supported by our observation of
diazoxide improving diastolic dysfunction in doxorubicin
treated hearts, by lowering the elevation of LVEDP. 
Diastolic dysfunction and contracture is proposed to be 
related to ROS generation [22,23].
Diazoxide pretreated hearts also had lower 
concentrations of TnT in cardiac effluate compared to hearts that
were pretreated with 5-HD and diazoxide or 5-HD
alone. Troponins are myocardial regulatory proteins,
which regulate the calcium mediated actin and myosin
interaction. Troponin-T is widely used as a specific
marker to diagnose myocardial infarction. Doxorubicin
is associated with increased TnT in serum and in heart
effluate [15,24,25].
Finally, pretreatment with diazoxide was not associated
with decreased myocardial accumulation of doxorubicin or
doxorubicinol which suggest that the protective effects did
not involve a change of distribution of the anthracycline to
the heart in vivo.
In this study we wanted to investigate if opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels by diazoxide is protective
against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Mitochondrial 
KATP-channels have been implicated as important mediators
of preconditioning [26,27]. However, the evidence for their
role in preconditioning is primarily based on the effects of
pharmacological agents, in particular, diazoxide and 5-HD.
Diazoxide has been reported to be a specific opener of
mitochondrial KATP channels, but studies have suggested
that its mechanism of cardioprotection may be due to
other actions, such as inhibition of succinate 
dehydrogenase [28,29], activation of sarcolemmal KATP channels [30]
or transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore [31]. In addition, it might be argued that
the complex metabolic effects of 5-HD severely limit its
usefulness as a ‘selective’ blocker of mitochondrial KATP
channels [32]. Furthermore, since their identification 
heavily relies on the use of diazoxide as a specific opener and
5-HD as a specific blocker, the very existence of 
mitochondrial KATP channels may be questioned. This skeptical view
is supported by a study in which no changes in 
mitochondrial matrix volume induced by diazoxide or 5-HD could
be detected [33]. Hence, one view on 5-HD is that it
should no longer be considered a useful tool for studying
the role of mitochondrial KATP channels in preconditioning
[32]. Thus, although diazoxide attenuated 
doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in our results, our model was
not designed to establish the precise protective 
mechanisms. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the protective
effects involved a change in distribution of doxorubicin to
different compartments within the heart.
Conclusion
The main observation in the present results is that 
pretreatment with diazoxide attenuates doxorubicin-induced
cardiac contractile dysfunction, and attenuates release of
biomarkers of cardiotoxicity in effluate without 
decreasing the accumulation of doxorubicin. 5-HD completely
abolished this effect of diazoxide in our rat model. A 
possible mechanism could be opening of mitochondrial
KATP-channels. However, we cannot exclude other effects
of the drug, including opening of vascular KATP-channels.
The low specificity of 5-HD, calls for additional studies of
mechanisms of a promising protective intervention.

Abstract
Aim: Chemotherapy with doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxicity. Free radical generation and mitochondrial dysfunction
are thought to contribute to doxorubicin-induced cardiac failure. In this study we wanted to investigate if opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels by diazoxide is protective against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and if 5-hydroxydecanoate
(5-HD), a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel antagonist, abolished any protection by this intervention.
Methods: Wistar rats were divided into 7 groups (n = 6) and followed for 10 days with 5 intervention groups including
the following treatments: (1) Diazoxide and doxorubicin, (2) diazoxide and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), (3) 5-HD and
doxorubicin, (4) diazoxide and saline and (5) 5-HD and saline. On day 1, 3, 5 and 7 the animals received intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injections with 10 mg/kg diazoxide and/or 40 mg/kg 5-HD, 30 minutes before i.p. injections with 3.0 mg/kg
doxorubicin. One control group received only saline injections and the other control group received saline 30 minutes
prior to 3.0 mg/kg doxorubicin. On day 10 the hearts were excised and Langendorff-perfused. Cardiac function was
assessed by an intraventricular balloon and biochemical effects by release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and troponin-T
(TnT) in effluate from the isolated hearts, and by myocardial content of doxorubicin.
Results: Doxorubicin treatment produced a significant loss in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (p < 0.05) and
an increase in both H2O2 and TnT release in effluate (p < 0.05). Diazoxide significantly attenuated the decrease in LVDP
(p < 0.05) and abolished the increased release of H2O2 and TnT (p < 0.05). 5-HD abolished the effects of pretreatment
with diazoxide, and these effects were not associated with reduced myocardial accumulation of doxorubicin.
Conclusions: Pretreatment with diazoxide attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in the rat, measured by
physiological indices and TnT and H2O2 in effluate from isolated hearts. The effect could be mediated by opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels, reduced doxorubicin-associated free radical generation and decreased cardiomyocyte
damage. Diazoxide represents a promising protective intervention against doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.

Background
Doxorubicin is a widely used chemotherapy drug, but its
application is associated with cardiotoxicity. Free radical
generation and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought
to contribute to doxorubicin-induced cardiac failure [1,2].
Dose reduction protocols have been proposed to avoid the
risk of delayed cardiotoxicity, but this might be at the
expense of the anticancer effect [3]. In addition, 
impaired calcium handling and cellular damage mediated

by reactive oxygen species, have been proposed as toxic
mechanisms to explain both acute and delayed 
cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines [4-6].
Diazoxide has been in clinical use since the early
1960’s to treat severe non-malignant and malignant
hypertension in hospitalized adults and acute severe
hypertension in hospitalized children. Diazoxide is also
used to treat hypoglycaemia. The mechanisms of 
diazox-ide’s clinical action relate predominantly to the opening
of pancreatic and smooth muscle KATP-channels [7].

preconditioning [8]. Pharmacological preconditioning,
mimicking ischemic preconditioning, is suggested as an
intervention to reduce doxorubicin cardiotoxicity [9].
Morphine has been demonstrated to mimic 
preconditioning in cardiomyocytes [10,11]. We have previously
observed increased mortality in rats pretreated in vivo
with morphine before doxorubicin (32). In a follow-up
study we pretreated rats with morphine, isolated the
hearts and exposed them to doxorubicin in a Langendorff
perfusion system (unpublished data). We found that 
pretreatment with morphine in vivo was associated with a
cardiodepressive effect in isolated hearts before 
doxorubicin exposure. After exposure to doxorubicin ex vivo,
isolated hearts from rats pretreated with morphine were
associated with increased release of hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), increased release of troponin-T (TnT), increased
myocardial contracture and increased myocardial content
of doxorubicin. These findings were in contrary to results
from a comparable study [9] which found that morphine
was protective against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Based
on these opposing results we wanted to investigate 
further, whether pharmacological preconditioning could 
reduce doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.
Direct stimulation of myocardial δ1-opioid receptors
leads to opening of mitochondrial KATP-channels and a
resultant increase in intracellular free radical signals
in vitro [10]. Recently, nicorandil, a mitochondrial 
KATP-channel opener, has successfully been administered to
counteract the toxic effects of doxorubicin [12,13]. In
light of our previous results, we now wanted to bypass
the opioid receptors in this experiment, and study how
direct opening of mitochondrial KATP-channels interacts
with the cardiotoxic mechanisms of anthracyclines. We
used diazoxide, a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel
agonist, known to have protective properties against 
cardiac ischemia [7,14]. We also used 5-hydroxydecanoate
(5-HD), a selective mitochondrial KATP-channel 
antagonist. 5-HD inhibits the increase in free radicals seen
with δ1-opioid receptor activation, and abolishes 
cardioprotection afforded by ischemic preconditioning [7]. Our
model combines drug treatment in vivo with the study of
hearts ex vivo, yielding direct physiological information on
systolic and diastolic cardiac function combined with 
biochemical indices like H2O2, TnTand measurement of 
myocardial content of doxorubicin.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Pretreatment with diazoxide attenuated 
doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in the rat in the present
study. Doxorubicin treatment produced a significant loss
in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (p < 0.05)
both in volume- and pressure regulated perfusion similar
to previous reports [15,16]. Diazoxide significantly 
attenuated this decrease in LVDP (p < 0.05) in both perfusion
protocols. Diazoxide also improved diastolic dysfunction
in doxorubicin treated hearts, by lowering the elevation
of LVEDP (p < 0.05) in both perfusion protocols, 
compared to animals that received both diazoxide and 5-HD.
The protective effect of diazoxide is equivalent to that of
ischemic preconditioning, and diazoxide is often used as
a pharmacological means to induce preconditioning [7].
The drug has previously been described as an agent with
a unique molecular target by opening of 
mitochondrial KATP-channels in cardioprotection. However, more

recently a consensus seems to emerge that there are 
numerous effectors involved in the cardioprotective effects of
diazoxide, and these effectors may synergistically 
contribute to its cardioprotective properties [7].
With volume regulated flow, the effects on 
doxorubicin-induced coronary vascular resistance, can be studied in
parallel with effects on myocardial contractility. During
volume regulated perfusion, aortic pressure, an indirect
measure of coronary resistance, was increased in hearts
that received both diazoxide and 5-HD, or just 5-HD, 
before doxorubicin. However, diazoxide pretreatment 
attenuated this effect. The vasodilatory effects of diazoxide in
vascular smooth muscle are due to opening of vascular
KATP-channels. KATP-channels have a pronounced role in
controlling coronary blood flow and the coronary reserve,
particularly in the resistance arterioles [17]. In some studies
diazoxide has been noted to improve coronary flow, which
is associated with cardioprotection, in perfused hearts [18],
despite the fact that the coronary flow reserve is low in
crystalloid-perfused hearts [19]. Coronary flow was 
significantly higher (p < 0.05) in DIADOX compared to
SALDOX during pressure regulated perfusion. This 
effect was abolished with 5-HD. Based on these results,
improved cardiac function associated with preserved 
coronary flow during pressure regulated perfusion, and 
attenuated increase in aortic pressure during volume regulated
perfusion, could account for some of the cardioprotective
effects of diazoxide.

of H2O2 in cardiac effluate compared to hearts that were
pretreated with 5-HD and diazoxide or 5-HD alone.
Diazoxide is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex
II protein, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This 
inhibition also occurs in the heart [20]. The activity of SDH is
a site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and
the possibility has been raised that diazoxide and other
SDH inhibitors mediate some of their cardioprotective
effects via modulation of ROS production. Which ROS
signals cardioprotection is mediated through is not fully
understood [8]. Opening of mitochondrial KATP-chan-
nels leads to increased ROS, leading to a persistent open
state of the channel. The ROS responsible for this is not
known [7]. H2O2 has been proposed as one candidate
for this effect, although one study concludes that H2O2
is not the mediator of mitochondrial KATP-channel-
dependent ROS signalling [8]. In our study we found
higher levels of H2O2 in effluate from hearts that had
not undergone diazoxide pretreatment before 
doxorubicin, or that had received both 5-HD and diazoxide
before doxorubicin. The level of H2O2 associated with
cellular signalling is much lower than the levels 
associated with cardiotoxicity [21]. The present study was not
designed to examine signalling effects, and our 
observations are thus associated with the reduced cardiotoxicity
of doxorubicin. This is supported by our observation of
diazoxide improving diastolic dysfunction in doxorubicin
treated hearts, by lowering the elevation of LVEDP. 
Diastolic dysfunction and contracture is proposed to be 
related to ROS generation [22,23].
Diazoxide pretreated hearts also had lower 
concentrations of TnT in cardiac effluate compared to hearts that
were pretreated with 5-HD and diazoxide or 5-HD
alone. Troponins are myocardial regulatory proteins,
which regulate the calcium mediated actin and myosin
interaction. Troponin-T is widely used as a specific
marker to diagnose myocardial infarction. Doxorubicin
is associated with increased TnT in serum and in heart
effluate [15,24,25].
Finally, pretreatment with diazoxide was not associated
with decreased myocardial accumulation of doxorubicin or
doxorubicinol which suggest that the protective effects did
not involve a change of distribution of the anthracycline to
the heart in vivo.
In this study we wanted to investigate if opening of
mitochondrial KATP-channels by diazoxide is protective
against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Mitochondrial 
KATP-channels have been implicated as important mediators
of preconditioning [26,27]. However, the evidence for their
role in preconditioning is primarily based on the effects of
pharmacological agents, in particular, diazoxide and 5-HD.
Diazoxide has been reported to be a specific opener of
mitochondrial KATP channels, but studies have suggested
that its mechanism of cardioprotection may be due to
other actions, such as inhibition of succinate 
dehydrogenase [28,29], activation of sarcolemmal KATP channels [30]
or transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore [31]. In addition, it might be argued that
the complex metabolic effects of 5-HD severely limit its
usefulness as a ‘selective’ blocker of mitochondrial KATP
channels [32]. Furthermore, since their identification 
heavily relies on the use of diazoxide as a specific opener and
5-HD as a specific blocker, the very existence of 
mitochondrial KATP channels may be questioned. This skeptical view
is supported by a study in which no changes in 
mitochondrial matrix volume induced by diazoxide or 5-HD could
be detected [33]. Hence, one view on 5-HD is that it
should no longer be considered a useful tool for studying
the role of mitochondrial KATP channels in preconditioning
[32]. Thus, although diazoxide attenuated 
doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in our results, our model was
not designed to establish the precise protective 
mechanisms. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the protective
effects involved a change in distribution of doxorubicin to
different compartments within the heart.
