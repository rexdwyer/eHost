>>>section: conclusion
Conclusion
In conclusion, even though sub-chronic exposure to 
ar-senite and arsenate through drinking water produced
different patterns of dyslipidemia, our study identified
two common denominators of dyslipidemia namely: 
inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport and increase in
plasma FFA. These two denominators (in addition to
other individual perturbations of lipid metabolism 
induced by each arsenical), might mediate the observed
cardiovascular and other disease endpoints of inorganic
arsenic exposure through drinking water.

Materials and methods
Chemicals
Sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate were products of
Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA.
Animals and treatment
Experimental protocols were conducted in accord with
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and were approved by the Animal Ethical
Committee of the Department of Biochemistry, Federal
University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria.
Fifty-six male Wistar rats (bred in the College of
Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of Agriculture,
Abeokuta, Nigeria) with a mean body weight of 130 g were
used for the experiments. They were housed in an animal
room with normal controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and
a regular 12 h light-dark cycle (06:00-18:00 h). They were
allowed 14 days to acclimatise before the commencement
of arsenic exposure. The animals were maintained on a
standard pellet diet.
Animals were divided into 8 groups of 7 animals each.
While 2 groups served as control and received distilled
water, the remaining groups (3 groups each) were exposed
to 50, 100 and 150 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite and
100, 150 and 200 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenate 
respectively in their drinking water for 12 weeks. These arsenic
concentrations were chosen based on previous studies
[11-15]. At the end of arsenic exposure, blood was 
collected from the animals into heparinised tubes by 
cardiac puncture under light ether anaesthesia after an
overnight fast. Liver, kidney, heart, lung, brain and
spleen were also removed from the animals for arsenic
and lipid analyses. An aliquot of the blood samples was
taken for arsenic determination while the remaining
blood samples were centrifuged to separate plasma and
red blood cells. All samples were stored at −20 °C until
analysed.
Arsenic determination
A portion of the frozen organs (≈200 mg) and whole
blood (0.2 ml) were digested in nitric acid. Total arsenic
(which would include inorganic and organic forms) was
determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results
are expressed as μg As/ml for blood and μg As/g wet
weight for the organs.
Biochemical analyses
Plasma and lipoprotein lipid profiles
Determination of the major lipids (cholesterol, 
triglycerides, phospholipids and free fatty acids) in plasma and
lipoproteins followed established procedures. Details of
these have been given in our earlier studies [7, 16-19].
Organ and erythrocyte lipid profiles
Lipids were extracted from the organs (liver, kidney,
heart, lung, brain and spleen) as described by Folch et al.
(1957) [20] while extraction of erythrocyte lipids followed
the procedure described by Rose and Oklander (1965)
[21]. After washing with 0.05 M KCl solution, aliquots
of the lipid extracts were then used for the 
determination of lipid profiles. Details of these are given as
reported earlier [7, 16-19].
Determination of hepatic and brain HMG-CoA reductase
activity
This was determined according to the method of Rao
and Ramakrishnan (1975) [22] by measuring the hepatic
and brain concentrations of HMG-CoA and mevalonate.
The ratio of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is taken as an
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 3 of 15
index of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. An increase
in this ratio indicates inhibition of cholesterogenesis while
a decrease indicates enhanced cholesterogenesis.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. One way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test was used
to analyze the results with p < 0.05 considered 
significant. Associations among the parameters and their 
magnitudes were determined using Pearson correlation.

Abstract
Background: Recent epidemiological evidences indicate close association between inorganic arsenic exposure via
drinking water and cardiovascular diseases. However, the exact mechanism of this arsenic-mediated increase in
cardiovascular risk factors remains enigmatic.
Methods: In order to investigate the effects of inorganic arsenic exposure on lipid metabolism, male albino rats
were exposed to 50, 100 and 150 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite and 100, 150 and 200 ppm arsenic as sodium
arsenate respectively in their drinking water for 12 weeks.
Results: Dyslipidemia induced by the two arsenicals exhibited different patterns. Hypocholesterolemia characterised
the effect of arsenite at all the doses, but arsenate induced hypercholesterolemia at the 150 ppm As dose.
Hypertriglyceridemia was the hallmark of arsenate effect whereas plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) was increased by
the two arsenicals. Reverse cholesterol transport was inhibited by the two arsenicals as evidenced by decreased
HDL cholesterol concentrations whereas hepatic cholesterol was increased by arsenite (100 ppm As), but decreased
by arsenite (150 ppm As) and arsenate (100 ppm As) respectively. Brain cholesterol and triglyceride were decreased
by the two arsenicals; arsenate decreased the renal content of cholesterol, but increased renal content of triglyceride.
Arsenite, on the other hand, increased the renal contents of the two lipids. The two arsenicals induced phospholipidosis
in the spleen. Arsenite (150 ppm As) and arsenate (100 ppm As) inhibited hepatic HMG CoA reductase. At other doses of
the two arsenicals, hepatic activity of the enzyme was up-regulated. The two arsenicals however up-regulated the activity
of the brain enzyme. We observed positive associations between tissue arsenic levels and plasma FFA and negative
associations between tissue arsenic levels and HDL cholesterol.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even though sub-chronic exposure to arsenite and arsenate through drinking
water produced different patterns of dyslipidemia, our study identified two common denominators of dyslipidemia
namely: inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport and increase in plasma FFA. These two denominators (in addition to
other individual perturbations of lipid metabolism induced by each arsenical), suggest that in contrast to strengthening
a dose-dependent effect phenomenon, the two forms of inorganic arsenic induced lipotoxic and non-lipotoxic
dyslipidemia at “low” or “medium” doses and these might be responsible for the cardiovascular and other disease
endpoints of inorganic arsenic exposure through drinking water.

Background
Among the plethora of toxicants, arsenic ranks as an
environmentally ubiquitous and epidemiologically 
important metalloid currently poisoning tens of millions of
people worldwide [1, 2]. It is found in both inorganic
and organic forms and in different valence or oxidation
states in the environment.
Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with a wide
range of toxic effects [1, 3]. Cancer of the skin, lung,
kidney, liver and urinary bladder are the important 
cancers associated with these toxic effects [1-3]. Among the
non-cancer effects of arsenic, diabetes mellitus, goitre,
hepatomegaly, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, 
cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, are well documented
[3-5]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that
ingestion of arsenic through drinking water might be
responsible for these carcinogenic and non-cancer effects
of arsenic [3, 4, 6]. In spite of this large body of
information about the toxic effects of arsenic, the 
precise mechanisms of action for the many disease
endpoints following acute and chronic arsenic exposure,
as well as the threshold for biologic effects and disease
risks, remain enigmatic [1].
Over the years, epidemiological studies have identified
lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities as independent risk
factors in the pathogenesis and progression of 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [7, 8]. There is also
increasing evidence that environmental factors/conta-
minants (most especially heavy metals) contribute to this
dyslipidemia [7, 9, 10]. Studies conducted in 
arsenic-exposed populations revealed a prevalence of nearly a
full spectrum of cardiovascular diseases including 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, blackfoot disease, ischaemic
heart diseases, etc. [3, 4]. Therefore, it seems reasonable
to hypothesise that the association between arsenicosis
and cardiovascular diseases may be mediated through
modification of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The
work reported here explored this hypothesis.

A portion of the frozen organs (≈200 mg) and whole
blood (0.2 ml) were digested in nitric acid. Total arsenic
(which would include inorganic and organic forms) was
determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results
are expressed as μg As/ml for blood and μg As/g wet
weight for the organs.
Biochemical analyses
Plasma and lipoprotein lipid profiles
Determination of the major lipids (cholesterol, 
triglycerides, phospholipids and free fatty acids) in plasma and
lipoproteins followed established procedures. Details of
these have been given in our earlier studies [7, 16-19].
Organ and erythrocyte lipid profiles
Lipids were extracted from the organs (liver, kidney,
heart, lung, brain and spleen) as described by Folch et al.
(1957) [20] while extraction of erythrocyte lipids followed
the procedure described by Rose and Oklander (1965)
[21]. After washing with 0.05 M KCl solution, aliquots
of the lipid extracts were then used for the 
determination of lipid profiles. Details of these are given as
reported earlier [7, 16-19].
Determination of hepatic and brain HMG-CoA reductase
activity
This was determined according to the method of Rao
and Ramakrishnan (1975) [22] by measuring the hepatic
and brain concentrations of HMG-CoA and mevalonate.
The ratio of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is taken as an
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 3 of 15
index of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. An increase
in this ratio indicates inhibition of cholesterogenesis while
a decrease indicates enhanced cholesterogenesis.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. One way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test was used
to analyze the results with p < 0.05 considered 
significant. Associations among the parameters and their 
magnitudes were determined using Pearson correlation.
Results
Table 1 depicts the index of arsenic exposure (expressed
as weekly arsenic intake/rat) calculated by the formula:
water consumption (ml) × arsenic concentration (ppm).
Arsenic intake per week was relatively constant in each
dose group. For the arsenite-exposed rats, each animal
ingested 7.41 ± 0.29 mg As/week in the 50 ppm group,
while arsenic ingestion was 13.13 ± 0.69 mg As/week
and 17.33 ± 0.60 mg As/week in the 100 ppm and
150 ppm groups respectively. For the 12 weeks of 
exposure, each animal in the 50 ppm group ingested a total of
88.91 mg of arsenic, while an animal in the 100 ppm
group and 150 ppm group had a total arsenic intake of
157.58 mg and 207.90 mg respectively. The 
arsenate-exposed animals also showed a constant rate of arsenic
intake. In the 100 ppm group, an animal consumed on
the average, a total of 12.06 ± 0.68 mg As/week, while in
the 150 ppm and 200 ppm groups, the intake per week
were 16.02 ± 1.07 mg and 22.04 ± 1.87 mg respectively.
Total arsenic intake in the groups amounted to 144.75 mg,
192.20 mg and 264.42 mg per rat for the 100 ppm,
150 ppm and 200 ppm doses respectively.
Arsenic levels in some of the tissues in rats 
administered either arsenite or arsenate in their drinking water
are shown in Table 2. Although the administration of
the two arsenicals resulted in an accumulation of arsenic
in blood, liver, kidney, heart, lung, brain and spleen of
the animals, only in the kidney of arsenate-treated and
the brain of arsenite-treated animals was the 
accumulation found to be dose-dependent. In arsenite-treated 
animals, exposure to an arsenic dose of 50 ppm resulted in
arsenic content of 305 μg As/ml of blood. Doubling of
the arsenic dose did not result in any further increase in
arsenic content. Rather, arsenic content of the blood
approached a saturation. At the highest dose of arsenic
in the sodium arsenite group (150 ppm), arsenic content
of the blood reduced from 301 μg As/ml to 258 μg As/ml.
In the arsenate-treated animals, exposure to an arsenic
dose of 100 ppm resulted in an arsenic content of
228.44 μg As/ml of blood. Increasing the arsenic dose
resulted in a further increase in arsenic content from
228.44 μg As/ml to 267.10 μg As/ml. Increasing the 
arsenic dose to 200 ppm did not result in any appreciable
increase in arsenic content of blood. Rather, arsenic
content of blood in this group of animals peaked at
273.23 μg As/ml. In arsenite-exposed animals, the
spleen accumulated the highest amount of arsenic, whereas
in arsenate-exposed animals, kidney accumulated the
highest amount of arsenic.
Dyslipidemia induced by arsenite was characterised by
hypocholesterolemia at all the arsenic doses (Fig. 1). At

both 100 ppm and 150 ppm doses of arsenic in 
arsenite-treated animals, cholesterol reduced from 56.48 ± 3.21 mg/
dl in control to 41.10 ± 3.35 mg/dl and 43.49 ± 3.87 mg/dl
respectively. Arsenate, on the other hand, increased plasma
cholesterol by 69 % at the 150 ppm As dose but decreased
this lipid by 23 % at 100 ppm As. HDL cholesterol was
reduced to the same extent by the two arsenicals. At the
highest dose of each arsenical, HDL cholesterol was just
about 50 % of control values (Fig. 1).
As indicated in Fig. 2, arsenite elicited a hormetic
response in plasma triglyceride concentration in which
the 50 ppm As dose up-regulated whereas the 100 ppm
As dose down-regulated the plasma triglyceride content.
The 50 ppm arsenic dose in arsenite-exposed animals
increased the plasma triglyceride content from 46.81 ±
2.25 to 55.32 ± 3.33 mg/dl. Doubling the arsenic dose
resulted in a 25 % reduction in triglyceride whereas
plasma triglyceride level at highest arsenic dose was not
significantly different from the control (p > 0.05). 
Arsenate, on the other hand, induced hypertriglyceridemia at
all the doses of arsenic employed. Arsenite exposure at
the 50 ppm As dose also caused an elevation of the
HDL triglyceride content while, at 150 ppm As dose,
the lipid was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). With 
arsenate exposure, however, there was no significant
change in HDL triglyceride concentrations except at the
150 ppm As dose where an increase in concentration
was observed.
Plasma phospholipid concentrations were significantly
reduced in both arsenite- and arsenate-exposed rats at
the highest dose (p < 0.05) while no significant changes
at both the low and medium doses were observed
(Fig. 3). Exposure of the animals to either arsenite or
arsenate did not result in any significant changes in the
HDL phospholipid contents at all the doses employed,
although there was a gradual depression of the 
concentrations as the arsenate doses were increased (Fig. 3).
Cholesterol concentration in the LDL + VLDL fraction
was increased on exposure to arsenite and arsenate at all
arsenic doses (Fig. 4). The increase in the 
arsenite-exposed rats amounted to 49 % whereas in 
arsenate-exposed rats the increases amounted to 30 %, 165 % and
99 % in the 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 200 ppm groups
respectively. Triglyceride contents of the LDL + VLDL
fraction were not affected by exposure to arsenite but
arsenate caused a 2-fold increase in same lipid at
150 ppm and 200 ppm As doses (Fig. 4).
The mean phospholipid concentrations in LDL +
VLDL as depicted in Fig. 4 indicate that both arsenite
and arsenate exposures resulted in depletion of LDL +
VLDL phospholipids. In arsenite-exposed animals, the
highest depletion of 52 % was observed at the 100 ppm
As dose, but with arsenate, the reduction was maximal
in the highest dose group (200 ppm) where 41 % 
reduction was observed.
The erythrocyte lipid contents of the animals are
shown in Fig. 5. Both arsenite and arsenate exposures 
resulted in significant depression of the cholesterol 
contents of the red blood cells in the animals (p < 0.05).
Arsenite-exposure resulted in 35 % and 44 % decreases
in cholesterol contents of the erythrocyte of rats with
100 ppm and 150 ppm As respectively. In 
arsenate-exposed rats, 34, 44 and 39 % reduction resulted from
exposure to 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 200 ppm arsenic
doses respectively. Arsenite exposure did not affect 
triglyceride contents of rat erythrocytes as no significant
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 6 of 15
change (p > 0.05) was observed in the concentrations.
Exposure to 100 ppm As in arsenate-exposed animals,
however, resulted in a 31 % increase in erythrocyte 
triglyceride concentration (p < 0.05). Increase in the arsenic
dose did not result in any further significant increase in
the erythrocyte triglyceride.
Phospholipid concentrations in the erythrocyte were
markedly lowered on exposure to the two arsenicals, 
although in both cases, the reduction was not 
dose-dependent. While the reduction amounted to 51, 29 and
39 % respectively in arsenite-treated animals, it amounted
to 32, 16 and 49 % respectively in arsenate-treated animals.
Plasma and erythrocyte FFA concentrations are depicted
in Fig. 6. In both arsenite- and arsenate-exposed animals,
HDLa
there was a gradual increase in both plasma and 
erythrocyte FFA concentrations as the arsenic doses were 
increased. Comparatively, in the plasma, the increase was
more pronounced in arsenate-treated animals whereas in
the erythrocytes the increase was more pronounced in
arsenite-treated animals.
The effects of the arsenicals on hepatic, renal and
brain cholesterol concentrations are depicted in Fig. 7.
While arsenite increased hepatic and renal cholesterol
by 35 and 82 % respectively, it decreased brain 
cholesterol by as much as 50 % at the highest dose of arsenic.
Arsenate, on the other hand, increased hepatic 
cholesterol but decreased renal and brain cholesterol 
concentrations by 50 and 31 % respectively.
ba
Cardiac, pulmonary and splenic cholesterol contents
are shown in Fig. 8. Exposure to the two arsenicals 
resulted in the depletion of the cardiac cholesterol while
increasing pulmonary and splenic cholesterol contents.
At the highest dose of each arsenical, cardiac cholesterol
was just 23 % (arsenite) and 50 % (arsenate) of control
values respectively. In the pulmonary compartment, the
pattern of increase was similar for the two arsenicals. In
the splenic compartment, however, while the highest
increase (42 %) was observed with the highest dose of
arsenic in arsenite-exposed animals, it was the 100 ppm

Arsenite elicited a hormetic response in hepatic 
triglyceride concentrations (Fig. 9). While the 50 ppm arsenic
dose up-regulated triglyceride concentration by 35 %,
the highest dose of arsenic (150 ppm) also caused a
35 % reduction in triglyceride concentration (Fig. 9).
Arsenate, on the other hand, increased hepatic 
triglyceride (11 % and 43 %) at 150 and 200 ppm As doses
respectively. Both arsenite and arsenate increased the
renal contents of triglyceride. The increase was more
pronounced in arsenite-treated animals. The two 
arsenicals also decreased to the same extent the triglyceride
concentration of the brain, although the decrease was
Cardiac, pulmonary and splenic triglyceride contents
are shown in Fig. 10. The heart responded to the 
presence of the two arsenicals in a similar pattern. While the
heart responded to the lowest dose of each arsenical
with a decrease (64 % in arsenite and 28 % in arsenate),
triglyceride contents began to increase with each 
increasing dose of the arsenicals, although the increase did
not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05) within the 
exposed groups. In contrast to the heart, there was a 
dose-dependent decrease in the triglyceride contents in the
lungs in arsenate exposure. Although arsenite also 
increased pulmonary triglycerides, the increase was not
dose-dependent. Exposure to the two arsenicals did not
The mean phospholipid concentrations in the 
tissues of the animals as depicted in Figs. 11 and 12
indicate that exposure to both arsenicals resulted in
splenic phospholipidosis. Arsenite exposure alone 
resulted in brain phospholipidosis while arsenate 
exposure at the highest dose (200 ppm As) resulted in
hepatic phospholipidosis. In contrast however, 
arsenate caused a significant reduction in phospholipid
concentrations in the brain, heart and lung of the 
animals (Fig. 11) whereas it was only in the heart, liver
and lung that phospholipid was reduced on exposure
to arsenite (Figs. 11 and 12). Renal phospholipids
were not affected by any of the arsenicals irrespective

As indicated in Fig. 13, arsenite (150 ppm As) and
arsenate (100 ppm As), inhibited hepatic HMG CoA
reductase activity. At other doses of the arsenicals,
hepatic HMG CoA reductase was up-regulated by 17 %
by the two arsenicals respectively. The activity of the
brain enzyme was also up-regulated by the two 
arsenicals (arsenite 56 % and arsenate 54 %).
The associations between tissue arsenic levels and
some lipid parameters are depicted in Table 3. While 
tissue arsenic levels correlated positively with plasma FFA,
reverse cholesterol transport was negatively correlated
with tissue arsenic levels. Tissue arsenic levels (with the
exception of hepatic arsenic vs. hepatic HMG CoA 
reductase and brain arsenic vs. hepatic HMG CoA 
reduc-tase), also correlated positively with hepatic and brain
Discussion
Arsenic accumulated in all the organs investigated 
irrespective of the chemical species administered with 
concentrations raised by many folds compared to control.
The rather high level of arsenic in the blood of the 
exposed rats has been reported by others [13, 23] and is
mainly contributed by the erythrocytes which are 
responsible for the distribution of arsenic throughout the body.
Following exposure to inorganic arsenic, As V is 
sequentially reduced to As III. The As III produced by this
reduction or from direct ingestion is then oxidatively
methylated to give pentavalent organic arsenicals, 
monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid
(DMA) [24]. This in turn is a function of cellular uptake
of the inorganic arsenic in various tissues [25]. Uptake of

At physiological pH, trivalent arsenic compounds are
neutral in charge while pentavalent arsenicals are 
negatively charged. Trivalent arsenic species can thus, readily
transverse cell membranes than do pentavalent species
[26]. Arsenite, therefore, might have been deposited in
the organs at a faster rate than arsenate. Apart from
blood, spleen accumulated the highest concentration of
arsenic than any other tissue studied in arsenite-exposed
rats. This was followed by heart and then kidney, brain,
lung and liver in that order. In arsenate-exposed rats, 
accumulation was highest in the kidney, followed by lung,
heart, brain, spleen and liver. Arsenate, in its protonated
form, has similar properties and can substitute for
phosphate in several biochemical reactions [27]. The
high deposition in the kidney could, therefore, have 
resulted from the organ’s physiological involvement in the
aa
reabsorption of phosphate. Arsenate and phosphate have
been reported to compete for the same binding sites,
with a preference for arsenate absorption [28]. Once
taken up by the tissues, inorganic arsenic is methylated
to MMAV and DMAV and excreted in the urine [24].
However, this biomethylation process may become 
saturated due to the different levels of methyltransferases
present in each tissue, resulting in a reduced rate of
clearance and hence increased deposition in the tissues
[29]. Furthermore, this biomethylation process (oxidative
methylation followed by reduction to trivalency) which
was originally considered a detoxification process, may
actually be an activation process in view of the formation
of reactive intermediates like MMAIII and DMAIII [30]. In
addition to these, improvement in analytical techniques
has led to the discovery of new sulphur-containing
methylated arsenic metabolites, 
monomethylmonothioar-sonic acid (MMMTAV) and dimethylmonothioarsinic acid
(DMMTAV) in human urine [31]. To what extent this 
recent arsenic toxicokinetic information influences arsenic
distribution/deposition in tissues on exposure to inorganic
arsenic through drinking water remains to be elucidated.
The findings of this study also indicate that 
subchronic exposure to arsenite and arsenate through
drinking water is associated with lipotoxic and 
non-lipotoxic perturbations in lipid homeostasis in organs,
lipoproteins, plasma and erythrocytes as well as increase
in HMG CoA reductase activity. Compared to control
animals, lipotoxic perturbations in arsenic-exposed
animals were characterised by high circulating FFA,
enhanced splenic cholesterogenesis and phospholipidosis,
pulmonary and hepatic cholesterogenesis as well as
hypertriglyceridemia in plasma and LDL +VLDL fraction.
Decrease in pulmonary and hepatic phospholipids, 
depletion of cardiac and brain lipids as well as depletion of
erythrocyte, plasma and HDL cholesterol and 
phospholipids in circulation, characterised the non-lipotoxic effects
of both arsenicals. An enrichment with cholesterol and
depletion of phospholipids were also observed in the
LDL + VLDL fraction. Since the patterns of this
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 12 of 15
homeostatic imbalance differ with each arsenic specie and
dose, different mechanisms might mediate this imbalance.
In addition, since exposure to the arsenic species was
through the oral route, interaction between arsenic and
these lipids probably did not begin at the level of the
gastro-intestinal tract. Rather, lipid dynamics after 
absorption might be the lipotoxic target of arsenic. These 
observations could be discussed along several lines.
Under normal physiological conditions, all tissues avidly
acquire lipids from circulating non-esterified FFA 
associated with albumin, esterified fatty acids bound to 
lipoproteins chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (and
liberated by lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis), 
internalization of whole lipoproteins and de novo synthesis [32,
33], although de novo synthesis might play only a minor
role in some tissues [32, 34]. Excess lipid, beyond that
needed for cellular structures and ATP generation is
stored in lipid droplets [32, 34]. However, tissues like liver,
intestine, heart and brain are able to synthesise and secrete
excess lipids in lipoproteins [32, 35-38].
FFAs originating from either albumin or lipoproteins
enter the organs either by passive diffusion or via a 
protein carrier-mediated pathway [33, 34]. While the former
is a lower affinity non-saturable process operating at
higher FFA concentrations, the protein carrier-mediated
pathway is a low capacity but high affinity process 
operating at FFA/albumin ratios found in the plasma [33,
34]. Protein carriers that have been characterized include
fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD 36), plasma membrane
fatty-acid binding protein and fatty acid transport 
protein [33, 34].
Both arsenic species induced significant elevation of
plasma FFA concentration. This observation implies that
while arsenic exposure did not affect the absorption of
dietary lipids, cellular lipid dynamics was modulated by
arsenic exposure. Generally hydrolysis of triglycerides
occurs in the adipose tissue and results in the 
production of FFA with its subsequent release into the plasma.
The elevation of this lipid suggests its increased
mobilization from the adipose tissue which could be 
induced by physiological and psychological stress [39].
With consistent report of arsenic causing oxidative stress
[40-42], the elevated plasma FFA implies an 
arsenic-induced augmentation of triglyceride hydrolysis in the
adipose tissue by triglyceride lipase, resulting in 
increased mobilization of the liberated FFA into the
plasma. The physiological consequences of this elevated
plasma FFA could be viewed from the metabolic roles of
FFA. While this elevated plasma FFA should provide an
immediate substrate for triglyceride synthesis as well as
the source of available fuel for the tissues and also the
necessary signal for tissues to oxidize them [43, 44], data
in Fig. 6 indicate what while exposure to arsenic did not
inhibit the uptake of FFA by the tissues, a considerable
amount of the FFA was directed towards the synthesis of
triglycerides in the liver, kidney and lungs as well as
phospholipids in the spleen. Data in Fig. 9 also indicate
that while the liver could be said to have a limited
capacity for triglyceride storage, tissues like kidney and
lungs accumulated the triglyceride to about 2-fold that
of the liver. This further suggests that arsenic induced a
dysfunction of triglyceride degradation secondary to 
insufficient mitochondrial ß-oxidation of FFA, thus 
compromising energy metabolism in these tissues. Further
significant energetic and functional consequences might
be expected.
The key enzyme in the distribution of circulating lipids
between organs is lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme
located on the walls of blood capillaries [32]. The role of
LPL in lipoprotein metabolism is well known. Since 
majority of the circulating FFAs are present as triglycerides
in lipoproteins, hydrolysis of this triglyceride by LPL is
an important determinant of overall fatty acid uptake
and ß-oxidation in the tissues [45, 46]. High circulating
FFA (as observed in this study) is known to inhibit the
activity of LPL [47]. Homeostatically, inhibition of LPL
is expected to have the following consequences on lipid
dynamics in the circulation:
1. Severe hypertriglyceridemia secondary to
underutilisation of chylomicrons and VLDL
2. Hypocholesterolemia
3. Decrease in HDL cholesterol (otherwise known as
reverse cholesterol transport) and phospholipids [48].
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 13 of 15
That arsenic exposure resulted in all these lipid metabolic
derangements (Figs. 1 and 3) suggests that the inhibition of
LPL might mediate these observed effects of arsenic.
Another major finding of this study was the depletion
of cardiac lipids in arsenic-exposed animals. 
Physiologically, cardiac myocytes have regulatory pathways that
regulate lipid metabolism. The myocardium has labile
stores of triglyceride that serve as an endogenous source
of FFAs [49, 50]. Intramyocardial triglyceride can be 
hy-drolysed by hormone sensitive lipase and adipose 
triglyceride lipase [32, 33]. Insulin inhibits lipolysis, whereas
catecholamines, thyroid hormone and glucagon, accelerate
intramyocardial triglyceride degradation [51]. Whether
arsenic-induced adrenergic stress in the animals might
mediate the depletion of cardiac lipids observed in this
study is not known at present. Furthermore, since the
major cardiac lipids were depleted as a result of arsenic
exposure, the possibility that arsenic might induce 
overex-pression/production of cardiac apolipoprotein B (Apo B)
which increased lipid secretion from the heart, cannot be
ruled out [38]. Apo B expression has been found to 
increase in hearts of patients with coronary artery disease
[52], a cardiovascular outcome that is a hallmark of
arsenic exposure [53].
Due to the blood brain barrier, circulating 
lipoproteins cannot reach the brain except for small HDL 
particles [54]. Most of the lipoproteins in the brain are
synthesised by the astrocytes and have been postulated
to be responsible for the transfer of lipids within the
brain [36, 55]. Thus, an arsenic-induced damage to the
blood brain barrier might be responsible for the 
dyslipidemia observed in the brain of the arsenic-exposed 
animals [56, 57].
Enhanced cholesterogenesis observed in the spleen,
lungs and liver of arsenite- and arsenate-exposed 
animals as well as the kidney of arsenate-exposed animals,
may be attributed to an arsenic-induced activation of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA)
reductase (the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol 
syn-thesis) or it may be due to feedback inhibition [58, 59].
It may also be due to inhibition of the activity of
cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme
located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This could limit
the biosynthesis of bile acids, which is the only 
significant route for elimination of cholesterol from the body
[60]. Since the liver has limited capacity to store lipids,
the excess cholesterol and triglycerides are packaged into
VLDL particles and secreted into circulation. Consistent
with this was the observation of the enrichment of LDL
+ VLDL fraction with cholesterol and triglycerides.
Furthermore, since this fraction was depleted of 
phospholipids, this implies a failure occasioned by arsenic
exposure in hepatic provision of phospholipids that are
found in lipoproteins (Fig. 4) [61].
Compelling experimental data from animal studies
have shown a positive association between high 
circulating FFA and pathological conditions such as diabetes
mellitus, obesity, thyrotoxicosis, atherosclerosis, 
coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, high blood 
pressure and pulmonary diseases [39, 62-64]. Furthermore,
elevated pulmonary cholesterol has been shown to 
inhibit surfactant function by disrupting the physiology
and turnover of surfactant, leading to impairment of
lungs mechanics [65]. Abnormalities in surfactant 
metabolism are the leading causes of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, acute lung injury and a diverse array of
other respiratory illnesses [66]. That arsenic exposure
causes all these conditions have been confirmed from
epidemiological studies of arsenicosis [3]. Thus, the 
sustained dyslipidemia observed in this study may be one of
the underlying mechanisms of these arsenic-induced
pathologies.
One limitation of this study was that arsenic speciation
was not carried out in the tissues. Rather, arsenic in the 
tissues was determined as total arsenic. In view of the recent
discovery of new methylsulphur derivatives of inorganic
arsenic, it opens up the possibility that these organic 
metabolites may be more subtle and insidious in their toxic
effects. Toxicological information on these newly 
discovered organic metabolites is scanty. However, in a recent
study in our laboratory in which rats were exposed to
pentavalent inorganic and organic arsenicals through 
drinking water, arsenic accumulation and dyslipidemia of the
same magnitude were also observed. These recent data, 
together with the data in the present study, support a linkage
between metabolism and chemical form of arsenic and
lipotoxic and non-lipotoxic effects of this metalloid.
Conclusion
In conclusion, even though sub-chronic exposure to 
arsenite and arsenate through drinking water produced
different patterns of dyslipidemia, our study identified
two common denominators of dyslipidemia namely: 
inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport and increase in
plasma FFA. These two denominators (in addition to
other individual perturbations of lipid metabolism 
induced by each arsenical), might mediate the observed
cardiovascular and other disease endpoints of inorganic
arsenic exposure through drinking water.

Abstract
Background: Recent epidemiological evidences indicate close association between inorganic arsenic exposure via
drinking water and cardiovascular diseases. However, the exact mechanism of this arsenic-mediated increase in
cardiovascular risk factors remains enigmatic.
Methods: In order to investigate the effects of inorganic arsenic exposure on lipid metabolism, male albino rats
were exposed to 50, 100 and 150 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite and 100, 150 and 200 ppm arsenic as sodium
arsenate respectively in their drinking water for 12 weeks.
Results: Dyslipidemia induced by the two arsenicals exhibited different patterns. Hypocholesterolemia characterised
the effect of arsenite at all the doses, but arsenate induced hypercholesterolemia at the 150 ppm As dose.
Hypertriglyceridemia was the hallmark of arsenate effect whereas plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) was increased by
the two arsenicals. Reverse cholesterol transport was inhibited by the two arsenicals as evidenced by decreased
HDL cholesterol concentrations whereas hepatic cholesterol was increased by arsenite (100 ppm As), but decreased
by arsenite (150 ppm As) and arsenate (100 ppm As) respectively. Brain cholesterol and triglyceride were decreased
by the two arsenicals; arsenate decreased the renal content of cholesterol, but increased renal content of triglyceride.
Arsenite, on the other hand, increased the renal contents of the two lipids. The two arsenicals induced phospholipidosis
in the spleen. Arsenite (150 ppm As) and arsenate (100 ppm As) inhibited hepatic HMG CoA reductase. At other doses of
the two arsenicals, hepatic activity of the enzyme was up-regulated. The two arsenicals however up-regulated the activity
of the brain enzyme. We observed positive associations between tissue arsenic levels and plasma FFA and negative
associations between tissue arsenic levels and HDL cholesterol.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even though sub-chronic exposure to arsenite and arsenate through drinking
water produced different patterns of dyslipidemia, our study identified two common denominators of dyslipidemia
namely: inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport and increase in plasma FFA. These two denominators (in addition to
other individual perturbations of lipid metabolism induced by each arsenical), suggest that in contrast to strengthening
a dose-dependent effect phenomenon, the two forms of inorganic arsenic induced lipotoxic and non-lipotoxic
dyslipidemia at “low” or “medium” doses and these might be responsible for the cardiovascular and other disease
endpoints of inorganic arsenic exposure through drinking water.

Background
Among the plethora of toxicants, arsenic ranks as an
environmentally ubiquitous and epidemiologically 
important metalloid currently poisoning tens of millions of
people worldwide [1, 2]. It is found in both inorganic
and organic forms and in different valence or oxidation
states in the environment.
Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with a wide
range of toxic effects [1, 3]. Cancer of the skin, lung,
kidney, liver and urinary bladder are the important 
cancers associated with these toxic effects [1-3]. Among the
non-cancer effects of arsenic, diabetes mellitus, goitre,
hepatomegaly, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, 
cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, are well documented
[3-5]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that
ingestion of arsenic through drinking water might be
responsible for these carcinogenic and non-cancer effects
of arsenic [3, 4, 6]. In spite of this large body of
information about the toxic effects of arsenic, the 
precise mechanisms of action for the many disease
endpoints following acute and chronic arsenic exposure,
as well as the threshold for biologic effects and disease
risks, remain enigmatic [1].
Over the years, epidemiological studies have identified
lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities as independent risk
factors in the pathogenesis and progression of 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [7, 8]. There is also
increasing evidence that environmental factors/conta-
minants (most especially heavy metals) contribute to this
dyslipidemia [7, 9, 10]. Studies conducted in 
arsenic-exposed populations revealed a prevalence of nearly a
full spectrum of cardiovascular diseases including 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, blackfoot disease, ischaemic
heart diseases, etc. [3, 4]. Therefore, it seems reasonable
to hypothesise that the association between arsenicosis
and cardiovascular diseases may be mediated through
modification of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The
work reported here explored this hypothesis.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Arsenic accumulated in all the organs investigated 
irrespective of the chemical species administered with 
concentrations raised by many folds compared to control.
The rather high level of arsenic in the blood of the 
exposed rats has been reported by others [13, 23] and is
mainly contributed by the erythrocytes which are 
responsible for the distribution of arsenic throughout the body.
Following exposure to inorganic arsenic, As V is 
sequentially reduced to As III. The As III produced by this
reduction or from direct ingestion is then oxidatively
methylated to give pentavalent organic arsenicals, 
monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid
(DMA) [24]. This in turn is a function of cellular uptake
of the inorganic arsenic in various tissues [25]. Uptake of

At physiological pH, trivalent arsenic compounds are
neutral in charge while pentavalent arsenicals are 
negatively charged. Trivalent arsenic species can thus, readily
transverse cell membranes than do pentavalent species
[26]. Arsenite, therefore, might have been deposited in
the organs at a faster rate than arsenate. Apart from
blood, spleen accumulated the highest concentration of
arsenic than any other tissue studied in arsenite-exposed
rats. This was followed by heart and then kidney, brain,
lung and liver in that order. In arsenate-exposed rats, 
accumulation was highest in the kidney, followed by lung,
heart, brain, spleen and liver. Arsenate, in its protonated
form, has similar properties and can substitute for
phosphate in several biochemical reactions [27]. The
high deposition in the kidney could, therefore, have 
resulted from the organ’s physiological involvement in the
aa
reabsorption of phosphate. Arsenate and phosphate have
been reported to compete for the same binding sites,
with a preference for arsenate absorption [28]. Once
taken up by the tissues, inorganic arsenic is methylated
to MMAV and DMAV and excreted in the urine [24].
However, this biomethylation process may become 
saturated due to the different levels of methyltransferases
present in each tissue, resulting in a reduced rate of
clearance and hence increased deposition in the tissues
[29]. Furthermore, this biomethylation process (oxidative
methylation followed by reduction to trivalency) which
was originally considered a detoxification process, may
actually be an activation process in view of the formation
of reactive intermediates like MMAIII and DMAIII [30]. In
addition to these, improvement in analytical techniques
has led to the discovery of new sulphur-containing
methylated arsenic metabolites, 
monomethylmonothioar-sonic acid (MMMTAV) and dimethylmonothioarsinic acid
(DMMTAV) in human urine [31]. To what extent this 
recent arsenic toxicokinetic information influences arsenic
distribution/deposition in tissues on exposure to inorganic
arsenic through drinking water remains to be elucidated.
The findings of this study also indicate that 
subchronic exposure to arsenite and arsenate through
drinking water is associated with lipotoxic and 
non-lipotoxic perturbations in lipid homeostasis in organs,
lipoproteins, plasma and erythrocytes as well as increase
in HMG CoA reductase activity. Compared to control
animals, lipotoxic perturbations in arsenic-exposed
animals were characterised by high circulating FFA,
enhanced splenic cholesterogenesis and phospholipidosis,
pulmonary and hepatic cholesterogenesis as well as
hypertriglyceridemia in plasma and LDL +VLDL fraction.
Decrease in pulmonary and hepatic phospholipids, 
depletion of cardiac and brain lipids as well as depletion of
erythrocyte, plasma and HDL cholesterol and 
phospholipids in circulation, characterised the non-lipotoxic effects
of both arsenicals. An enrichment with cholesterol and
depletion of phospholipids were also observed in the
LDL + VLDL fraction. Since the patterns of this
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 12 of 15
homeostatic imbalance differ with each arsenic specie and
dose, different mechanisms might mediate this imbalance.
In addition, since exposure to the arsenic species was
through the oral route, interaction between arsenic and
these lipids probably did not begin at the level of the
gastro-intestinal tract. Rather, lipid dynamics after 
absorption might be the lipotoxic target of arsenic. These 
observations could be discussed along several lines.
Under normal physiological conditions, all tissues avidly
acquire lipids from circulating non-esterified FFA 
associated with albumin, esterified fatty acids bound to 
lipoproteins chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (and
liberated by lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis), 
internalization of whole lipoproteins and de novo synthesis [32,
33], although de novo synthesis might play only a minor
role in some tissues [32, 34]. Excess lipid, beyond that
needed for cellular structures and ATP generation is
stored in lipid droplets [32, 34]. However, tissues like liver,
intestine, heart and brain are able to synthesise and secrete
excess lipids in lipoproteins [32, 35-38].
FFAs originating from either albumin or lipoproteins
enter the organs either by passive diffusion or via a 
protein carrier-mediated pathway [33, 34]. While the former
is a lower affinity non-saturable process operating at
higher FFA concentrations, the protein carrier-mediated
pathway is a low capacity but high affinity process 
operating at FFA/albumin ratios found in the plasma [33,
34]. Protein carriers that have been characterized include
fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD 36), plasma membrane
fatty-acid binding protein and fatty acid transport 
protein [33, 34].
Both arsenic species induced significant elevation of
plasma FFA concentration. This observation implies that
while arsenic exposure did not affect the absorption of
dietary lipids, cellular lipid dynamics was modulated by
arsenic exposure. Generally hydrolysis of triglycerides
occurs in the adipose tissue and results in the 
production of FFA with its subsequent release into the plasma.
The elevation of this lipid suggests its increased
mobilization from the adipose tissue which could be 
induced by physiological and psychological stress [39].
With consistent report of arsenic causing oxidative stress
[40-42], the elevated plasma FFA implies an 
arsenic-induced augmentation of triglyceride hydrolysis in the
adipose tissue by triglyceride lipase, resulting in 
increased mobilization of the liberated FFA into the
plasma. The physiological consequences of this elevated
plasma FFA could be viewed from the metabolic roles of
FFA. While this elevated plasma FFA should provide an
immediate substrate for triglyceride synthesis as well as
the source of available fuel for the tissues and also the
necessary signal for tissues to oxidize them [43, 44], data
in Fig. 6 indicate what while exposure to arsenic did not
inhibit the uptake of FFA by the tissues, a considerable
amount of the FFA was directed towards the synthesis of
triglycerides in the liver, kidney and lungs as well as
phospholipids in the spleen. Data in Fig. 9 also indicate
that while the liver could be said to have a limited
capacity for triglyceride storage, tissues like kidney and
lungs accumulated the triglyceride to about 2-fold that
of the liver. This further suggests that arsenic induced a
dysfunction of triglyceride degradation secondary to 
insufficient mitochondrial ß-oxidation of FFA, thus 
compromising energy metabolism in these tissues. Further
significant energetic and functional consequences might
be expected.
The key enzyme in the distribution of circulating lipids
between organs is lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme
located on the walls of blood capillaries [32]. The role of
LPL in lipoprotein metabolism is well known. Since 
majority of the circulating FFAs are present as triglycerides
in lipoproteins, hydrolysis of this triglyceride by LPL is
an important determinant of overall fatty acid uptake
and ß-oxidation in the tissues [45, 46]. High circulating
FFA (as observed in this study) is known to inhibit the
activity of LPL [47]. Homeostatically, inhibition of LPL
is expected to have the following consequences on lipid
dynamics in the circulation:
1. Severe hypertriglyceridemia secondary to
underutilisation of chylomicrons and VLDL
2. Hypocholesterolemia
3. Decrease in HDL cholesterol (otherwise known as
reverse cholesterol transport) and phospholipids [48].
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 13 of 15
That arsenic exposure resulted in all these lipid metabolic
derangements (Figs. 1 and 3) suggests that the inhibition of
LPL might mediate these observed effects of arsenic.
Another major finding of this study was the depletion
of cardiac lipids in arsenic-exposed animals. 
Physiologically, cardiac myocytes have regulatory pathways that
regulate lipid metabolism. The myocardium has labile
stores of triglyceride that serve as an endogenous source
of FFAs [49, 50]. Intramyocardial triglyceride can be 
hy-drolysed by hormone sensitive lipase and adipose 
triglyceride lipase [32, 33]. Insulin inhibits lipolysis, whereas
catecholamines, thyroid hormone and glucagon, accelerate
intramyocardial triglyceride degradation [51]. Whether
arsenic-induced adrenergic stress in the animals might
mediate the depletion of cardiac lipids observed in this
study is not known at present. Furthermore, since the
major cardiac lipids were depleted as a result of arsenic
exposure, the possibility that arsenic might induce 
overex-pression/production of cardiac apolipoprotein B (Apo B)
which increased lipid secretion from the heart, cannot be
ruled out [38]. Apo B expression has been found to 
increase in hearts of patients with coronary artery disease
[52], a cardiovascular outcome that is a hallmark of
arsenic exposure [53].
Due to the blood brain barrier, circulating 
lipoproteins cannot reach the brain except for small HDL 
particles [54]. Most of the lipoproteins in the brain are
synthesised by the astrocytes and have been postulated
to be responsible for the transfer of lipids within the
brain [36, 55]. Thus, an arsenic-induced damage to the
blood brain barrier might be responsible for the 
dyslipidemia observed in the brain of the arsenic-exposed 
animals [56, 57].
Enhanced cholesterogenesis observed in the spleen,
lungs and liver of arsenite- and arsenate-exposed 
animals as well as the kidney of arsenate-exposed animals,
may be attributed to an arsenic-induced activation of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA)
reductase (the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol 
syn-thesis) or it may be due to feedback inhibition [58, 59].
It may also be due to inhibition of the activity of
cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme
located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This could limit
the biosynthesis of bile acids, which is the only 
significant route for elimination of cholesterol from the body
[60]. Since the liver has limited capacity to store lipids,
the excess cholesterol and triglycerides are packaged into
VLDL particles and secreted into circulation. Consistent
with this was the observation of the enrichment of LDL
+ VLDL fraction with cholesterol and triglycerides.
Furthermore, since this fraction was depleted of 
phospholipids, this implies a failure occasioned by arsenic
exposure in hepatic provision of phospholipids that are
found in lipoproteins (Fig. 4) [61].
Compelling experimental data from animal studies
have shown a positive association between high 
circulating FFA and pathological conditions such as diabetes
mellitus, obesity, thyrotoxicosis, atherosclerosis, 
coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, high blood 
pressure and pulmonary diseases [39, 62-64]. Furthermore,
elevated pulmonary cholesterol has been shown to 
inhibit surfactant function by disrupting the physiology
and turnover of surfactant, leading to impairment of
lungs mechanics [65]. Abnormalities in surfactant 
metabolism are the leading causes of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, acute lung injury and a diverse array of
other respiratory illnesses [66]. That arsenic exposure
causes all these conditions have been confirmed from
epidemiological studies of arsenicosis [3]. Thus, the 
sustained dyslipidemia observed in this study may be one of
the underlying mechanisms of these arsenic-induced
pathologies.
One limitation of this study was that arsenic speciation
was not carried out in the tissues. Rather, arsenic in the 
tissues was determined as total arsenic. In view of the recent
discovery of new methylsulphur derivatives of inorganic
arsenic, it opens up the possibility that these organic 
metabolites may be more subtle and insidious in their toxic
effects. Toxicological information on these newly 
discovered organic metabolites is scanty. However, in a recent
study in our laboratory in which rats were exposed to
pentavalent inorganic and organic arsenicals through 
drinking water, arsenic accumulation and dyslipidemia of the
same magnitude were also observed. These recent data, 
together with the data in the present study, support a linkage
between metabolism and chemical form of arsenic and
lipotoxic and non-lipotoxic effects of this metalloid.

Results
Table 1 depicts the index of arsenic exposure (expressed
as weekly arsenic intake/rat) calculated by the formula:
water consumption (ml) × arsenic concentration (ppm).
Arsenic intake per week was relatively constant in each
dose group. For the arsenite-exposed rats, each animal
ingested 7.41 ± 0.29 mg As/week in the 50 ppm group,
while arsenic ingestion was 13.13 ± 0.69 mg As/week
and 17.33 ± 0.60 mg As/week in the 100 ppm and
150 ppm groups respectively. For the 12 weeks of 
exposure, each animal in the 50 ppm group ingested a total of
88.91 mg of arsenic, while an animal in the 100 ppm
group and 150 ppm group had a total arsenic intake of
157.58 mg and 207.90 mg respectively. The 
arsenate-exposed animals also showed a constant rate of arsenic
intake. In the 100 ppm group, an animal consumed on
the average, a total of 12.06 ± 0.68 mg As/week, while in
the 150 ppm and 200 ppm groups, the intake per week
were 16.02 ± 1.07 mg and 22.04 ± 1.87 mg respectively.
Total arsenic intake in the groups amounted to 144.75 mg,
192.20 mg and 264.42 mg per rat for the 100 ppm,
150 ppm and 200 ppm doses respectively.
Arsenic levels in some of the tissues in rats 
administered either arsenite or arsenate in their drinking water
are shown in Table 2. Although the administration of
the two arsenicals resulted in an accumulation of arsenic
in blood, liver, kidney, heart, lung, brain and spleen of
the animals, only in the kidney of arsenate-treated and
the brain of arsenite-treated animals was the 
accumulation found to be dose-dependent. In arsenite-treated 
animals, exposure to an arsenic dose of 50 ppm resulted in
arsenic content of 305 μg As/ml of blood. Doubling of
the arsenic dose did not result in any further increase in
arsenic content. Rather, arsenic content of the blood
approached a saturation. At the highest dose of arsenic
in the sodium arsenite group (150 ppm), arsenic content
of the blood reduced from 301 μg As/ml to 258 μg As/ml.
In the arsenate-treated animals, exposure to an arsenic
dose of 100 ppm resulted in an arsenic content of
228.44 μg As/ml of blood. Increasing the arsenic dose
resulted in a further increase in arsenic content from
228.44 μg As/ml to 267.10 μg As/ml. Increasing the 
arsenic dose to 200 ppm did not result in any appreciable
increase in arsenic content of blood. Rather, arsenic
content of blood in this group of animals peaked at
273.23 μg As/ml. In arsenite-exposed animals, the
spleen accumulated the highest amount of arsenic, whereas
in arsenate-exposed animals, kidney accumulated the
highest amount of arsenic.
Dyslipidemia induced by arsenite was characterised by
hypocholesterolemia at all the arsenic doses (Fig. 1). At

both 100 ppm and 150 ppm doses of arsenic in 
arsenite-treated animals, cholesterol reduced from 56.48 ± 3.21 mg/
dl in control to 41.10 ± 3.35 mg/dl and 43.49 ± 3.87 mg/dl
respectively. Arsenate, on the other hand, increased plasma
cholesterol by 69 % at the 150 ppm As dose but decreased
this lipid by 23 % at 100 ppm As. HDL cholesterol was
reduced to the same extent by the two arsenicals. At the
highest dose of each arsenical, HDL cholesterol was just
about 50 % of control values (Fig. 1).
As indicated in Fig. 2, arsenite elicited a hormetic
response in plasma triglyceride concentration in which
the 50 ppm As dose up-regulated whereas the 100 ppm
As dose down-regulated the plasma triglyceride content.
The 50 ppm arsenic dose in arsenite-exposed animals
increased the plasma triglyceride content from 46.81 ±
2.25 to 55.32 ± 3.33 mg/dl. Doubling the arsenic dose
resulted in a 25 % reduction in triglyceride whereas
plasma triglyceride level at highest arsenic dose was not
significantly different from the control (p > 0.05). 
Arsenate, on the other hand, induced hypertriglyceridemia at
all the doses of arsenic employed. Arsenite exposure at
the 50 ppm As dose also caused an elevation of the
HDL triglyceride content while, at 150 ppm As dose,
the lipid was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). With 
arsenate exposure, however, there was no significant
change in HDL triglyceride concentrations except at the
150 ppm As dose where an increase in concentration
was observed.
Plasma phospholipid concentrations were significantly
reduced in both arsenite- and arsenate-exposed rats at
the highest dose (p < 0.05) while no significant changes
at both the low and medium doses were observed
(Fig. 3). Exposure of the animals to either arsenite or
arsenate did not result in any significant changes in the
HDL phospholipid contents at all the doses employed,
although there was a gradual depression of the 
concentrations as the arsenate doses were increased (Fig. 3).
Cholesterol concentration in the LDL + VLDL fraction
was increased on exposure to arsenite and arsenate at all
arsenic doses (Fig. 4). The increase in the 
arsenite-exposed rats amounted to 49 % whereas in 
arsenate-exposed rats the increases amounted to 30 %, 165 % and
99 % in the 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 200 ppm groups
respectively. Triglyceride contents of the LDL + VLDL
fraction were not affected by exposure to arsenite but
arsenate caused a 2-fold increase in same lipid at
150 ppm and 200 ppm As doses (Fig. 4).
The mean phospholipid concentrations in LDL +
VLDL as depicted in Fig. 4 indicate that both arsenite
and arsenate exposures resulted in depletion of LDL +
VLDL phospholipids. In arsenite-exposed animals, the
highest depletion of 52 % was observed at the 100 ppm
As dose, but with arsenate, the reduction was maximal
in the highest dose group (200 ppm) where 41 % 
reduction was observed.
The erythrocyte lipid contents of the animals are
shown in Fig. 5. Both arsenite and arsenate exposures 
resulted in significant depression of the cholesterol 
contents of the red blood cells in the animals (p < 0.05).
Arsenite-exposure resulted in 35 % and 44 % decreases
in cholesterol contents of the erythrocyte of rats with
100 ppm and 150 ppm As respectively. In 
arsenate-exposed rats, 34, 44 and 39 % reduction resulted from
exposure to 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 200 ppm arsenic
doses respectively. Arsenite exposure did not affect 
triglyceride contents of rat erythrocytes as no significant
Afolabi et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2015) 16:15 Page 6 of 15
change (p > 0.05) was observed in the concentrations.
Exposure to 100 ppm As in arsenate-exposed animals,
however, resulted in a 31 % increase in erythrocyte 
triglyceride concentration (p < 0.05). Increase in the arsenic
dose did not result in any further significant increase in
the erythrocyte triglyceride.
Phospholipid concentrations in the erythrocyte were
markedly lowered on exposure to the two arsenicals, 
although in both cases, the reduction was not 
dose-dependent. While the reduction amounted to 51, 29 and
39 % respectively in arsenite-treated animals, it amounted
to 32, 16 and 49 % respectively in arsenate-treated animals.
Plasma and erythrocyte FFA concentrations are depicted
in Fig. 6. In both arsenite- and arsenate-exposed animals,
HDLa
there was a gradual increase in both plasma and 
erythrocyte FFA concentrations as the arsenic doses were 
increased. Comparatively, in the plasma, the increase was
more pronounced in arsenate-treated animals whereas in
the erythrocytes the increase was more pronounced in
arsenite-treated animals.
The effects of the arsenicals on hepatic, renal and
brain cholesterol concentrations are depicted in Fig. 7.
While arsenite increased hepatic and renal cholesterol
by 35 and 82 % respectively, it decreased brain 
cholesterol by as much as 50 % at the highest dose of arsenic.
Arsenate, on the other hand, increased hepatic 
cholesterol but decreased renal and brain cholesterol 
concentrations by 50 and 31 % respectively.

Cardiac, pulmonary and splenic cholesterol contents
are shown in Fig. 8. Exposure to the two arsenicals 
resulted in the depletion of the cardiac cholesterol while
increasing pulmonary and splenic cholesterol contents.
At the highest dose of each arsenical, cardiac cholesterol
was just 23 % (arsenite) and 50 % (arsenate) of control
values respectively. In the pulmonary compartment, the
pattern of increase was similar for the two arsenicals. In
the splenic compartment, however, while the highest
increase (42 %) was observed with the highest dose of
arsenic in arsenite-exposed animals, it was the 100 ppm

Arsenite elicited a hormetic response in hepatic 
triglyceride concentrations (Fig. 9). While the 50 ppm arsenic
dose up-regulated triglyceride concentration by 35 %,
the highest dose of arsenic (150 ppm) also caused a
35 % reduction in triglyceride concentration (Fig. 9).
Arsenate, on the other hand, increased hepatic 
triglyceride (11 % and 43 %) at 150 and 200 ppm As doses
respectively. Both arsenite and arsenate increased the
renal contents of triglyceride. The increase was more
pronounced in arsenite-treated animals. The two 
arsenicals also decreased to the same extent the triglyceride
concentration of the brain, although the decrease was
Cardiac, pulmonary and splenic triglyceride contents
are shown in Fig. 10. The heart responded to the 
presence of the two arsenicals in a similar pattern. While the
heart responded to the lowest dose of each arsenical
with a decrease (64 % in arsenite and 28 % in arsenate),
triglyceride contents began to increase with each 
increasing dose of the arsenicals, although the increase did
not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05) within the 
exposed groups. In contrast to the heart, there was a 
dose-dependent decrease in the triglyceride contents in the
lungs in arsenate exposure. Although arsenite also 
increased pulmonary triglycerides, the increase was not
dose-dependent. Exposure to the two arsenicals did not
The mean phospholipid concentrations in the 
tissues of the animals as depicted in Figs. 11 and 12
indicate that exposure to both arsenicals resulted in
splenic phospholipidosis. Arsenite exposure alone 
resulted in brain phospholipidosis while arsenate 
exposure at the highest dose (200 ppm As) resulted in
hepatic phospholipidosis. In contrast however, 
arsenate caused a significant reduction in phospholipid
concentrations in the brain, heart and lung of the 
animals (Fig. 11) whereas it was only in the heart, liver
and lung that phospholipid was reduced on exposure
to arsenite (Figs. 11 and 12). Renal phospholipids
were not affected by any of the arsenicals irrespective

As indicated in Fig. 13, arsenite (150 ppm As) and
arsenate (100 ppm As), inhibited hepatic HMG CoA
reductase activity. At other doses of the arsenicals,
hepatic HMG CoA reductase was up-regulated by 17 %
by the two arsenicals respectively. The activity of the
brain enzyme was also up-regulated by the two 
arsenicals (arsenite 56 % and arsenate 54 %).
The associations between tissue arsenic levels and
some lipid parameters are depicted in Table 3. While 
tissue arsenic levels correlated positively with plasma FFA,
reverse cholesterol transport was negatively correlated
with tissue arsenic levels. Tissue arsenic levels (with the
exception of hepatic arsenic vs. hepatic HMG CoA 
reductase and brain arsenic vs. hepatic HMG CoA 
reduc-tase), also correlated positively with hepatic and brain
