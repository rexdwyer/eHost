MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents.
APAP, UDP-glucuronic acid, and acetaminophen glucuronide
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Propylene glycol,
5,59-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and
glutathione reductase (GR) from yeast were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were obtained
from commercial sources and were reagent grade or better.
Animals. Two- to 4-month-old male homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous
(1/-) nrf2 knockout mice (ICR/129SVJ chimeric mice [Itoh et al., 1997]) and
their wild-type littermates (1/1) were used in this study. DNA was taken from
the tail of each mouse and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
confirm its genotype. The mice were housed in stainless-steel cages in an
animal room maintained at 24 6 2°C and using a 12-h light/dark cycle (light
on at 7:00 A.M. and off at 7:00 P.M.). Food (certified diet M, Oriental Yeast Co,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and water were made freely available to the mice, except
where otherwise stated.
Treatment of animals. In the dose-response study the administration 
protocol was performed according to Manautou et al. (1996). After overnight
fasting, APAP (in 50% propylene glycol as vehicle) was administered to the
mice, po, between 8:30 and 9:30 A.M. at doses of either 0, 150, 300, or 600
mg/kg, 5 ml/kg being used in each case. Four mice of each genotype were used
for each dose, except for the 150-mg/kg dose in which only 3 heterozygous
knockout mice were used. Food was withheld until 2 h after dosing, but water
was available throughout the experiment. The animals were sacrificed 24 h
after dosing.
In the time-course study a dose of 300 mg/kg APAP was administered to the
mice and the animals were sacrificed at 0 (after overnight fasting and without
dosing), 2, 8, or 24 h after dosing. Other experimental conditions were the
same as those used in the dose-response study. An additional 8 homozygous
knockout and wild-type mice were sacrificed after overnight fasting and
without dosing, for the purpose of metabolic baseline activity analysis.

a Number of animals that died within 24 h/number of animals used.
Biochemical assays. Following withdrawal of blood from the posterior
vena cava of anesthetized animals, plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) activity
was determined using an automated biochemical analyzer, CHEM1t (Bayer
Corp., Tarrytown, NY). The animals were sacrificed by exanguination, livers
were removed, and microsomes were prepared. Microsomal protein 
concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951). Cytochrome
P450 content was determined according to Omura and Sato (1964). Hepatic
UDP-GT activity from detergent-treated microsomes was determined using
APAP as the aglycon substrate according to Bock and Bock-Henning (1987)
and Manautou et al. (1996). NPSH was extracted from samples of each liver
using 1 M perchloric acid and measured by the enzymatic cycling method of
Tietze (1969) as modified by Griffith (1980).
Histopathology. Samples of each liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 24 h, processed by routine methodology, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), and examined by light microscopy. Hepatic lesions were
graded from to 111 (-,
-
no lesions; 6, degeneration of centrilobular
hepatocytes; 1, slight centrilobular necrosis (necrotic hepatocytes present in 
1-to 3-cell layers from the central vein); 11, moderate centrilobular necrosis
(necrotic hepatocytes present in more than 3-cell layers from the central vein
but limited to less than half of the liver section); 111, severe centrilobular
necrosis (necrotic areas occupying half or more than half of the liver section)).
Histopathological evaluation was performed blind, in which the identity of
both the genotype and type of treatment was not revealed to those undertaking
the examination.
Immunohistochemistry. Deparaffinized liver sections were placed in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
Sections were heated in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a microwave oven for
6 min and rinsed twice, 5 min each wash, with phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBST). After blocking non-specific binding
sites with 4% BlockAce (Dai-Nippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka) for 20 min,
sections were incubated in a rabbit polyclonal antibody against APAP (Bio-
genesis, Kingston, NH; 1:250) for 30 min; negative control sections were
incubated in PBST only. Sections were rinsed with PBST, incubated in
biotinylated goat antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin at a 1:1000 dilution
(DAKO Japan, Tokyo) for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBST, and incubated in
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at a 1:500 dilution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen,
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Each step was performed at
room temperature, except where otherwise stated.
Determination of gGCS and Ugt1a6 mRNAs. Total cellular RNA was
extracted by RNAzolTM B (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood). The RNA 
samples (20 mg) were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to Zeta-Probe
GT membranes (Bio-Rad Japan, Tokyo). The membranes were probed with
[32P]-labelled cDNA against Ugt1a6 and the catalytic heavy and regulatory
light chains of gGCS; b-actin cDNA was used as a positive control. We
obtained the cDNA probe against each gene by RT-PCR, using mouse liver
RNA as a template.
The primer used for each gene was as follows:
gGCS heavy chain:
Forward primer 59-ATGGGGCTGCTGTCCCATGG-39
Reverse primer 59-AGCCTGATGCTCTCCTAGTA-39
gGCS light chain:
Forward primer 59-CTGCAGACCGGGAACCAGCT-39
Reverse primer 59-AGATCAGAGGTGCCTATAGC-39
Ugt1a6:
Forward primer 59-CTTCCTGCAGGGTTTCTCTTCC-39
Reverse primer 59-CAACGATGCCATGCTCCCC-39
The hybridized membranes were processed to autoradiographs and quantitated
by MacBas software.
Statistical analysis. Results are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation,
where available. Statistical analyses of differences between values of the
vehicle control group (0 mg/kg) or those before dosing (0 h) from mice of the
172

Nrf2, which belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZip) 
transcription factor family, has been implicated as a key molecule involved
in antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-mediated gene 
expression. In order to examine the role of Nrf2 in protection against
xenobiotic toxicity, the sensitivity of nrf2 knockout mice to 
acetaminophen (N-acetyl-4-aminophenol (APAP)) was analyzed. The
saturation of detoxification pathways after high levels of exposure
to APAP is known to induce hepatotoxicity. Two factors 
important in its detoxification are UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-
GT), an ARE-regulated phase-II drug-metabolizing enzyme, and
glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant molecule whose synthesis 
depends on ARE-regulated g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gGCS).
Two- to 4-month-old male mice were orally administered a single
dose of APAP at 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. Doses of 300 mg/kg
APAP or greater caused death in the homozygous knockout mice
only, and those that survived showed a greater severity in hepatic
damage than the wild-type mice, as demonstrated by increased
plasma alanine aminotransferase activity, decreased hepatic 
non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) content, and centrilobular 
hepatocellular necrosis. The high sensitivity of Nrf2-deficient mice was
confirmed from observations made at 0, 2, 8, and 24 h after dosing
with 300 mg/kg APAP; increased anti-APAP immunoreactivity
was also noted in their livers at 2 h. Untreated homozygous
knockout mice showed both a lower UDP-GT activity and NPSH
content, which corresponded to decreased mRNA levels of
UDP-GT (Ugt1a6) and the heavy chain of gGCS, respectively.
These results show that Nrf2 plays a protective role against APAP
hepatotoxicity by regulating both drug metabolizing enzymes and
antioxidant genes through the ARE.

Drug metabolizing enzymes and antioxidant systems 
represent 2 major defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.
Electrophiles, radicals, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
often generated as intermediates or by-products of xenobiotic
metabolism. These molecules, if not properly eliminated, 
provoke lipid peroxidation and oxidation of DNA and other 
cellular components, which results in various acute and chronic
tissue injuries, carcinogenesis, and aging (Halliwell et al.,
1995a,b; Martin et al., 1996; Slaga, 1995). Accumulation of
these harmful oxidants in the cell is prevented through the
actions of small antioxidant molecules such as GSH and 
vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1
(HO-1), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Rautalahti
and Huttunen, 1993; Sen, 1995). Drug metabolizing enzymes,
such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), work in concert with
antioxidant systems by metabolizing electrophiles and 
xenobiotics, and some of the molecules involved in these 2 defense
mechanisms are induced simultaneously in response to 
xenobiotic exposure (Prestera et al., 1995). Such concerted gene
induction of drug metabolizing and antioxidant defense 
systems occurs through a common regulatory region called the
ARE (antioxidant responsive element) or EpRE (electrophile
responsive element) (Buetler et al., 1995; Prestera and Talalay,
1995).
While searching for proteins that regulate expression of the
b-globin gene during differentiation, the Nrf family of 
transcription factors was identified. Originally, Nrf2 was isolated
in 1994 from a human K562 erythroid cell line and in 1995
from a chicken erythroid cDNA library (HD3) (Itoh et al.,
1995; Moi et al., 1994). The designation Nrf2 (NF-E2 related
factor 2) was derived from the known transcription factor p45
subunit of NF-E2 (Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2), with which it
shows high sequence homology. Within the family of bZip
transcription factors, Nrf2, p45 NF-E2, and their homologues
constitute a discrete subfamily whose members share regions
of homology with that of the Drosophila Cap’n’Collar (CNC)
protein (Chan et al., 1993; Itoh et al., 1995; Kobayashi et al.,
169
170
1999; Moi et al., 1994). While the expression of p45 is limited
to erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, Nrf2 is widely 
expressed in tissues that include muscle, kidney, lung, intestine,
and liver (Itoh et al., 1995; Moi et al., 1994). Furthermore,
elimination of Nrf2 expression does not influence 
erythropoi-esis (Chan et al., 1996; Itoh et al., 1997; Kuroha et al., 1998).
Thus, until recently, the precise function of Nrf2 was unknown.
The fact that the Nrf2 binding site, namely the NF-E2 binding
motif or MARE (Maf-recognition element), is highly similar to
the ARE, and that its tissue-specific expression is most similar
to that of ARE-regulated genes led to the speculation that Nrf2
is an important regulator of ARE-mediated gene expression
(Itoh et al., 1997; Venugopal and Jaiswal, 1996).
The genes that were first shown to be controlled by Nrf2 in
vivo encode drug-metabolizing enzymes such as GST and
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) (Itoh et al., 1997); these
genes are inducible by the antioxidant butylated 
hydroxyanisole (BHA) which acts through the ARE present in their 
regulatory regions. Dietary administration of 0.7% BHA for 16 to
20 days greatly impaired the induction of NQO1 and 3 classes
of GST (Alpha, Mu, and Pi) in both the liver and intestine of
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice compared to their 
heterozygous littermates (Itoh et al., 1997). It was recently 
demonstrated that detoxification-enzyme genes are not unique in their
regulation by Nrf2. For example, Nrf2 was shown to be 
essential for the induction of HO-1, peroxiredoxin MSP23, and the
cystine transporter (Xc2) by electrophilic agents in mouse 
peritoneal macrophages (Ishii et al., 2000). HO-1 and 
peroxire-doxin have antioxidative activities, whereas Xc2 increases the
intracellular cysteine necessary for GSH synthesis. The 
involvement of Nrf2 in the regulation of HO-1 and gGCS, an
enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthetic
pathway of GSH, has also been reported by other investigators
(Alam
et al., 1999; Moinova and Mulcahy, 1999). The 
requirement of Nrf2 in the regulation of such genes was further
confirmed by the depressed expression of UDP-GT (Ugt1a6),
catalase, and SOD1 observed in nrf2 knockout mice (Chan and
Kan, 1999).
The molecular mechanism of Nrf2 activation by reactive
electrophiles has partially been clarified (Ishii et al., 2000; Itoh
et al., 1999). Keap1, a homologue of the Drosophila actin
binding protein Kelch, binds to the N-terminal Neh2 domain of
Nrf2, thereby retaining this transcription factor in the 
cytoplasm (Adams et al., 2000; Itoh et al., 1999; Xue and Cooley,
1993). Treatment of cells with reactive electrophiles 
counteracts this sequestration of Nrf2 by Keap1, such that Nrf2 
trans-locates
to the nucleus and upregulates ARE-mediated 
transcription.
Considering its function, Nrf2 is expected to play an 
important role in the defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.
In fact, the high sensitivity of nrf2 knockout mice to butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT)-induced pulmonary injury has recently
been reported (Chan and Kan, 1999); the mechanism of their
high sensitivity was, however, not clearly demonstrated. APAP
ENOMOTO ET AL.
was used as a chemical model in the present study to examine
the mechanism by which Nrf2 plays a protective role against
the toxicity of xenobiotics and to elucidate the relationship
between Nrf2-regulated gene expression and such protection.
APAP is widely used in tablet form for its antipyretic and
analgesic properties, and its metabolic pathways are well 
characterized (Cohen et al., 1998). At low doses, the majority of
APAP is readily conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate
and subsequently eliminated. A small portion of APAP 
undergoes biotransformation by cytochrome P450s to an 
electro-philic quinoneimine that nonenzymatically reacts with GSH for
excretion. Exposure to high doses of APAP saturates the 
glucuronidation and sulfation pathways and depletes the GSH
pool, thus enabling the reactive APAP intermediate to bind to
important intracellular macromolecules and result in 
cytotox-icity. Both the ARE-regulated phase II drug-metabolizing 
enzyme UDP-GT, and the antioxidant molecule GSH, whose
synthesis depends on the ARE-regulated gGCS enzyme, are
important in the detoxification of APAP.
In the present study, we demonstrated that nrf2 knockout
mice are highly sensitive to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity as a
result of a lowered activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes and
antioxidant systems, which represent the major Nrf2-regulated
defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents.
APAP, UDP-glucuronic acid, and acetaminophen glucuronide
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Propylene glycol,
5,59-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and
glutathione reductase (GR) from yeast were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were obtained
from commercial sources and were reagent grade or better.
Animals. Two- to 4-month-old male homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous
(1/-) nrf2 knockout mice (ICR/129SVJ chimeric mice [Itoh et al., 1997]) and
their wild-type littermates (1/1) were used in this study. DNA was taken from
the tail of each mouse and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
confirm its genotype. The mice were housed in stainless-steel cages in an
animal room maintained at 24 6 2°C and using a 12-h light/dark cycle (light
on at 7:00 A.M. and off at 7:00 P.M.). Food (certified diet M, Oriental Yeast Co,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and water were made freely available to the mice, except
where otherwise stated.
Treatment of animals. In the dose-response study the administration 
protocol was performed according to Manautou et al. (1996). After overnight
fasting, APAP (in 50% propylene glycol as vehicle) was administered to the
mice, po, between 8:30 and 9:30 A.M. at doses of either 0, 150, 300, or 600
mg/kg, 5 ml/kg being used in each case. Four mice of each genotype were used
for each dose, except for the 150-mg/kg dose in which only 3 heterozygous
knockout mice were used. Food was withheld until 2 h after dosing, but water
was available throughout the experiment. The animals were sacrificed 24 h
after dosing.
In the time-course study a dose of 300 mg/kg APAP was administered to the
mice and the animals were sacrificed at 0 (after overnight fasting and without
dosing), 2, 8, or 24 h after dosing. Other experimental conditions were the
same as those used in the dose-response study. An additional 8 homozygous
knockout and wild-type mice were sacrificed after overnight fasting and
without dosing, for the purpose of metabolic baseline activity analysis.

Biochemical assays. Following withdrawal of blood from the posterior
vena cava of anesthetized animals, plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) activity
was determined using an automated biochemical analyzer, CHEM1t (Bayer
Corp., Tarrytown, NY). The animals were sacrificed by exanguination, livers
were removed, and microsomes were prepared. Microsomal protein 
concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951). Cytochrome
P450 content was determined according to Omura and Sato (1964). Hepatic
UDP-GT activity from detergent-treated microsomes was determined using
APAP as the aglycon substrate according to Bock and Bock-Henning (1987)
and Manautou et al. (1996). NPSH was extracted from samples of each liver
using 1 M perchloric acid and measured by the enzymatic cycling method of
Tietze (1969) as modified by Griffith (1980).
Histopathology. Samples of each liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 24 h, processed by routine methodology, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), and examined by light microscopy. Hepatic lesions were
graded from to 111 (-,
-
no lesions; 6, degeneration of centrilobular
hepatocytes; 1, slight centrilobular necrosis (necrotic hepatocytes present in 
1-to 3-cell layers from the central vein); 11, moderate centrilobular necrosis
(necrotic hepatocytes present in more than 3-cell layers from the central vein
but limited to less than half of the liver section); 111, severe centrilobular
necrosis (necrotic areas occupying half or more than half of the liver section)).
Histopathological evaluation was performed blind, in which the identity of
both the genotype and type of treatment was not revealed to those undertaking
the examination.
Immunohistochemistry. Deparaffinized liver sections were placed in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
Sections were heated in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a microwave oven for
6 min and rinsed twice, 5 min each wash, with phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBST). After blocking non-specific binding
sites with 4% BlockAce (Dai-Nippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka) for 20 min,
sections were incubated in a rabbit polyclonal antibody against APAP (Bio-
genesis, Kingston, NH; 1:250) for 30 min; negative control sections were
incubated in PBST only. Sections were rinsed with PBST, incubated in
biotinylated goat antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin at a 1:1000 dilution
(DAKO Japan, Tokyo) for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBST, and incubated in
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at a 1:500 dilution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen,
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Each step was performed at
room temperature, except where otherwise stated.
Determination of gGCS and Ugt1a6 mRNAs. Total cellular RNA was
extracted by RNAzolTM B (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood). The RNA 
samples (20 mg) were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to Zeta-Probe
GT membranes (Bio-Rad Japan, Tokyo). The membranes were probed with
[32P]-labelled cDNA against Ugt1a6 and the catalytic heavy and regulatory
light chains of gGCS; b-actin cDNA was used as a positive control. We
obtained the cDNA probe against each gene by RT-PCR, using mouse liver
RNA as a template.
The primer used for each gene was as follows:
gGCS heavy chain:
Forward primer 59-ATGGGGCTGCTGTCCCATGG-39
Reverse primer 59-AGCCTGATGCTCTCCTAGTA-39
gGCS light chain:

Ugt1a6:

The hybridized membranes were processed to autoradiographs and quantitated
by MacBas software.

RESULTS
Dose-Response Study
To elucidate the role of Nrf2 in protection against APAP
toxicity, we first examined whether the sensitivity of the mice
to APAP toxicity was affected by eliminating Nrf2. A previous
study showed that 600 mg/kg APAP resulted in hepatic 
necrosis, with 10% lethality, in adult male CD-1 mice, whereas no
hepatotoxicity was observed at a dose of 200 mg/kg (Ginsberg
et al., 1982). Based on these data, doses of 600, 300, and 150
mg/kg APAP were chosen for the present study. The oral route
of administration was selected because Nrf2 is expressed in
gastrointestinal tract as well as in liver (Itoh et al., 1997).
When Nrf2-deficient mice were exposed to APAP, doses of
300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg resulted in the deaths of 1 and 3
mice, respectively, within 24 h. In contrast, no such lethality
was seen in either wild-type or heterozygous knockout mice at
any of the doses used (Table 1). These results suggest that nrf2
knockout mice are more sensitive to APAP toxicity than those
expressing Nrf2.
To characterize the APAP toxicity observed in Nrf2-defi-
cient mice, plasma ALT and hepatic NPSH levels were 
examined in animals that survived for 24 h after APAP treatment.

study. Animals were sacrificed before dosing (0 h) and at 2, 8,

marked damage found in the livers of Nrf2-deficient mice, the
most severe lesion that occurred in the wild-type mice was only
moderate (11) in one of 4 mice treated with 600 mg/kg
APAP. These data clearly show that nrf2 knockout mice are
more sensitive to APAP toxicity than wild-type animals.
Time-Course Study
died between 8 and 24 h after receiving the 300 mg/kg APAP
dose; however, this dose was not lethal to the other genotypes
tested.
Plasma ALT level markedly increased in the homozygous
knockout mice at 8 h after dosing, although the change was
not statistically significant because of large interindividual
differences among animals. On the other hand, wild-type
mice showed only a marginal increase after 24 h (Fig. 3A).
No significant changes in ALT levels were detected in
heterozygous mice at any of the time points tested. These
results indicate that hepatic damage occurs earlier in 
homozygous knockout mice compared to wild-type animals.
However, since the only histopathological change detected
in the latter was slight hepatocellular necrosis, even after
24 h (Table 2), it is possible that the hepatic injury in the
wild-type mice after 8 h was too subtle to be detected by the
analysis of ALT.
Hepatic NPSH levels significantly decreased in mice of
all genotypes after 2 h (Fig. 3B). Specifically, NPSH content
measured 2 h after APAP administration was 29, 25, and
10% of those measured before dosing (after overnight 
fast-ing) in the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous
knockout mice, respectively. The result is consistent with
previous findings which showed a decline in hepatic NPSH
levels at early time points after APAP exposure (Brady et
al., 1988). After 8 h, NPSH in the livers of the wild-type and
heterozygous knockout mice recovered and even became
higher than the pre-dose levels, suggesting complete 
recovery from the effect of APAP treatment subsequent to over-FIG.

Immunohistochemical Detection of APAP in the Liver
Since the binding of an APAP metabolite to cellular proteins
represents an important early event in its hepatotoxicity, the
levels of APAP-bound proteins in the livers of wild-type and
homozygous knockout mice were examined. 
Immunohisto-chemical staining, using an anti-APAP antibody, was 
performed on mice that had been sacrificed 2 h after dosing with
300 mg/kg APAP. Positive staining for APAP was detected in
the centrilobular hepatocytes of homozygous knockout mice,
but not in hepatocytes in other regions, nor in livers of 
wild-type mice (Fig. 5). These results suggest that a greater extent of
APAP-protein adduct formation occurs in livers of 
homozygous knockout mice compared to those of wild-type mice after
the same level of APAP exposure.
Baseline Activities of APAP Metabolism
The amount of the reactive APAP metabolite that can bind
to cellular proteins depends on both its activation and 
detoxi-night fasting, whereas values remained low in the 
homozygous knockout mice. Hepatic NPSH content of the latter
after 24 h was still at the pre-dose level, indicating that an
early decrease in NPSH in mice lacking Nrf2 is followed by
slow or insufficient recovery.
Histopathological examination revealed a degeneration in
centrilobular hepatocytes with small cytoplasmic vacuoles
(grade: 6) in all homozygous knockout mice after 2 h, while
most wild type and heterozygous knockout mice showed no
abnormality at this time point (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Various
degrees of centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis became 
apparent in all homozygous knockout mice after 8 h, but not in mice
of other genotypes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
nrf2 knockout mice exhibit similar time-course changes of
toxicity as those seen in wild-type mice exposed to higher
doses of APAP (Brady
et al., 1988; Cohen, 1998; Mitchell,
1973),
thus indicating a shared underlying mechanism of 
toxicity.

fication by processes of drug metabolism. To compare the
metabolic activity in nrf2 homozygous knockout mice with that
in wild-type mice, cytochrome P450 content, UDP-GT 
activity, and NPSH level were examined. In the livers of 
homozygous knockout mice, hepatic UDP-GT activity and NPSH
content were reduced to 64 and 82% of that in wild-type mice,
respectively (Fig. 6). In contrast, the cytochrome P450 content
in the livers of knockout and wild-type mice was similar. These
results suggest that Nrf2 affects basal activity of some 
pathways of APAP metabolism.
One plausible explanation for these differences in metabolic
activity is the transcriptional shut-off of drug-metabolizing
enzyme and antioxidant genes. To address this question, we
measured the mRNA levels of Ugt1a6 and the heavy and light
chains of gGCS in the livers of the mice by Northern blot
analysis. The mRNA levels of Ugt1a6 and the gGCS heavy
chain in the livers of the homozygous knockout mice were
lower than were those in the wild-type mice (56 and 64%,
respectively: Fig. 7), with a statistical significance of p # 0.05.
On the other hand, the mRNA level of the gGCS light chain
was only slightly less than that found in the control mice
(88%).
We also analyzed the expression of the above genes 2 h after
exposure to APAP to assess whether the induction of these
genes affected the sensitivity of the mice to APAP. However,
no induction of these genes was detected in mice of either
genotype at this time point (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Nrf2 has been shown
to be
a key molecule that responds to
reactive electrophiles by activating ARE-mediated gene 
expression. In this study, we showed that the mouse lacking Nrf2
is highly sensitive to APAP. Lower levels of APAP provoke
hepatotoxicity in homozygous nrf2 knockout mice and such
high sensitivity appears to be due to an insufficient expression
of detoxifying enzymes. As a consequence, APAP-conjugates
accumulate in centrilobular hepatocytes, causing their necrosis.
These results demonstrate that the nrf2 gene knockout mouse
serves as an important animal model system for the study of
acute drug toxicity.
Covalent binding of reactive APAP metabolites to cellular
proteins seems to be an important process in the induction of
hepatotoxicity (Cohen et al., 1998). As many as 23 proteins,
some of which are considered critical for cellular functions,
have been shown to bind to APAP in mouse liver (Qiu et al.,
1998). The anti-APAP antibody immunoreactivity in our study
was localized in the centrilobular region of the livers of 
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice and specifically overlapped with
the site of hepatic damage. This observation is in agreement
with the previous analysis of Bartolone et al. (1989), who
demonstrated accumulation of APAP-bound proteins in the
centrilobular area after an oral dose of 600 mg/kg APAP. The
fact that the anti-APAP antibody only stained the livers of
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice, but not of the wild-type
mice, shows that larger amounts of APAP metabolites have
accumulated in the former.
The reactive metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-
imine (NAPQI), is generated by a cytochrome P450-dependent
metabolic pathway (Cohen et al., 1998). The relative amount
of APAP bio-activated is determined by the activities of other
drug metabolizing pathways, such as glucuronidation and 
sulfation, which detoxify and eliminate APAP. In mice, 
approximately 60 to 80% of the total APAP is metabolized through
the glucuronidation pathway (Hazelton et al., 1986; Kim et al.,
1995; Manautou et al., 1996), and most of NAPQI is excreted
after GSH conjugation, without causing toxicity. In the 
homozygous nrf2 knockout mouse, analyses of these major 
metabolic parameters revealed general decreases in the levels of
detoxification enzyme activities, with no change being 
observed in that of the cytochrome P450 pathway. This would
explain the accumulation of the larger amounts of 
APAP-conjugated proteins in the cell and corresponding severe 
hepatic damage found in the nrf2 homozygous knockout mouse
(Fig. 8). Sulfation, a minor detoxification pathway of APAP,
was not examined in the present study. Whether or not the
sulfotransferase gene is ARE-regulated
or Nrf2 has any effect
on its expression needs to be clarified in future.
A reduction in both UDP-GT activity and NPSH content in
the liver of the knockout
mouse accompanied decreased 
expression in the mRNA levels of both Ugt1a6 and the heavy
chain of gGCS. Consistent with this observation, Chan and
Kan (1999) had reported a decrease in Ugt1a6 mRNA 
expression in the lung of the homozygous nrf2 knockout mouse. The
low levels of mRNA expression of Ugt1a6 and gGCS heavy
chain in untreated homozygous nrf2 knockout mice suggest a
lack of response to natural dietary inducers
or to the 
endogenous oxidative stress that occurs as a result of normal 
biological activities (Klaunig et al., 1995; Martin et al., 1996). This
observation indicates the importance of Nrf2 in counteracting
the oxidative stress generated during normal metabolic 
processes, in addition to providing protection against xenobiotics.
Oxidative stress appears to be an important factor associated
with APAP toxicity. Indeed, metallothionein (MT)-I/II 
knockout mice were recently shown to be highly sensitive to APAP,
perhaps due
to the lack of the antioxidant function of MT (Liu
et al., 1999). In mice, the oxidative stress produced by reactive
APAP metabolites may act as a strong inducer of Nrf2-regu-
lated gene expression mediated through the ARE. However,
induction of detoxification enzymes and antioxidant systems
by xenobiotics might be impaired in the nrf2 knockout mouse.
It is interesting to note that, in the nrf2 knockout mouse,
recovery of NPSH level to normal following APAP exposure
was markedly delayed. Two possibilities may explain this
result. First, the normal function of hepatocytes might have
been lost in the homozygous knockout mice and recovery of
NPSH level needed regeneration of hepatocytes. Second, the
nrf2 knockout mice might not have been able to activate the
compensatory pathway involved in recovering the NPSH level.
We cannot eliminate either possibility, and further roles of
Nrf2 in protecting against xenobiotics remain to be elucidated.
In contrast to the unequivocal phenotypic difference 
between homozygous knockout and wild-type mice, the 
sensitivity of heterozygous knockout animals to APAP appears to be
comparable to that of wild-type mice. Based on the mortality,
clinical chemistry, and histopathology data, no differences existed
between the heterozygous and wild-type mice following APAP
administration. Thus, a single copy of the Nrf2 gene seems to
provide sufficient protection against APAP hepatotoxicity.
Our study clearly demonstrates that Nrf2 protects against
APAP-induced toxicity by increasing the expression of both drug
metabolizing enzymes and antioxidants. Additional studies on the
Nrf2-mediated gene regulatory system would provide further 
insight into the integrated defense mechanisms of biological 
systems against xenobiotics and xenobiotic-induced oxidative stress.

DISCUSSION
Nrf2 has been shown
to be
a key molecule that responds to
reactive electrophiles by activating ARE-mediated gene 
expression. In this study, we showed that the mouse lacking Nrf2
is highly sensitive to APAP. Lower levels of APAP provoke
hepatotoxicity in homozygous nrf2 knockout mice and such
high sensitivity appears to be due to an insufficient expression
of detoxifying enzymes. As a consequence, APAP-conjugates
accumulate in centrilobular hepatocytes, causing their necrosis.
These results demonstrate that the nrf2 gene knockout mouse
serves as an important animal model system for the study of
acute drug toxicity.
Covalent binding of reactive APAP metabolites to cellular
proteins seems to be an important process in the induction of
hepatotoxicity (Cohen et al., 1998). As many as 23 proteins,
some of which are considered critical for cellular functions,
have been shown to bind to APAP in mouse liver (Qiu et al.,
1998). The anti-APAP antibody immunoreactivity in our study
was localized in the centrilobular region of the livers of 
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice and specifically overlapped with
the site of hepatic damage. This observation is in agreement
with the previous analysis of Bartolone et al. (1989), who
demonstrated accumulation of APAP-bound proteins in the
centrilobular area after an oral dose of 600 mg/kg APAP. The
fact that the anti-APAP antibody only stained the livers of
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice, but not of the wild-type
mice, shows that larger amounts of APAP metabolites have
accumulated in the former.
The reactive metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-
imine (NAPQI), is generated by a cytochrome P450-dependent
metabolic pathway (Cohen et al., 1998). The relative amount
of APAP bio-activated is determined by the activities of other
drug metabolizing pathways, such as glucuronidation and 
sulfation, which detoxify and eliminate APAP. In mice, 
approximately 60 to 80% of the total APAP is metabolized through
the glucuronidation pathway (Hazelton et al., 1986; Kim et al.,
1995; Manautou et al., 1996), and most of NAPQI is excreted
after GSH conjugation, without causing toxicity. In the 
homozygous nrf2 knockout mouse, analyses of these major 
metabolic parameters revealed general decreases in the levels of
detoxification enzyme activities, with no change being 
observed in that of the cytochrome P450 pathway. This would
explain the accumulation of the larger amounts of 
APAP-conjugated proteins in the cell and corresponding severe 
hepatic damage found in the nrf2 homozygous knockout mouse
(Fig. 8). Sulfation, a minor detoxification pathway of APAP,
was not examined in the present study. Whether or not the
sulfotransferase gene is ARE-regulated
or Nrf2 has any effect
on its expression needs to be clarified in future.
A reduction in both UDP-GT activity and NPSH content in
the liver of the knockout
mouse accompanied decreased 
expression in the mRNA levels of both Ugt1a6 and the heavy
chain of gGCS. Consistent with this observation, Chan and
Kan (1999) had reported a decrease in Ugt1a6 mRNA 
expression in the lung of the homozygous nrf2 knockout mouse. The
low levels of mRNA expression of Ugt1a6 and gGCS heavy
chain in untreated homozygous nrf2 knockout mice suggest a
lack of response to natural dietary inducers
or to the 
endogenous oxidative stress that occurs as a result of normal 
biological activities (Klaunig et al., 1995; Martin et al., 1996). This
observation indicates the importance of Nrf2 in counteracting
the oxidative stress generated during normal metabolic 
processes, in addition to providing protection against xenobiotics.
Oxidative stress appears to be an important factor associated
with APAP toxicity. Indeed, metallothionein (MT)-I/II 
knockout mice were recently shown to be highly sensitive to APAP,
perhaps due
to the lack of the antioxidant function of MT (Liu
et al., 1999). In mice, the oxidative stress produced by reactive
APAP metabolites may act as a strong inducer of Nrf2-regu-
lated gene expression mediated through the ARE. However,
induction of detoxification enzymes and antioxidant systems
by xenobiotics might be impaired in the nrf2 knockout mouse.
It is interesting to note that, in the nrf2 knockout mouse,
recovery of NPSH level to normal following APAP exposure
was markedly delayed. Two possibilities may explain this
result. First, the normal function of hepatocytes might have
been lost in the homozygous knockout mice and recovery of
NPSH level needed regeneration of hepatocytes. Second, the
nrf2 knockout mice might not have been able to activate the
compensatory pathway involved in recovering the NPSH level.
We cannot eliminate either possibility, and further roles of
Nrf2 in protecting against xenobiotics remain to be elucidated.
In contrast to the unequivocal phenotypic difference 
between homozygous knockout and wild-type mice, the 
sensitivity of heterozygous knockout animals to APAP appears to be
comparable to that of wild-type mice. Based on the mortality,
clinical chemistry, and histopathology data, no differences existed
between the heterozygous and wild-type mice following APAP
administration. Thus, a single copy of the Nrf2 gene seems to
provide sufficient protection against APAP hepatotoxicity.
Our study clearly demonstrates that Nrf2 protects against
APAP-induced toxicity by increasing the expression of both drug
metabolizing enzymes and antioxidants. Additional studies on the
Nrf2-mediated gene regulatory system would provide further 
insight into the integrated defense mechanisms of biological 
systems against xenobiotics and xenobiotic-induced oxidative stress.

RESULTS
Dose-Response Study
To elucidate the role of Nrf2 in protection against APAP
toxicity, we first examined whether the sensitivity of the mice
to APAP toxicity was affected by eliminating Nrf2. A previous
study showed that 600 mg/kg APAP resulted in hepatic 
necrosis, with 10% lethality, in adult male CD-1 mice, whereas no
hepatotoxicity was observed at a dose of 200 mg/kg (Ginsberg
et al., 1982). Based on these data, doses of 600, 300, and 150
mg/kg APAP were chosen for the present study. The oral route
of administration was selected because Nrf2 is expressed in
gastrointestinal tract as well as in liver (Itoh et al., 1997).
When Nrf2-deficient mice were exposed to APAP, doses of
300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg resulted in the deaths of 1 and 3
mice, respectively, within 24 h. In contrast, no such lethality
was seen in either wild-type or heterozygous knockout mice at
any of the doses used (Table 1). These results suggest that nrf2
knockout mice are more sensitive to APAP toxicity than those
expressing Nrf2.
To characterize the APAP toxicity observed in Nrf2-defi-
cient mice, plasma ALT and hepatic NPSH levels were 
examined in animals that survived for 24 h after APAP treatment.

phenotype associated with mice lacking Nrf2. Based on the
results of the dose-response study described above, 300 mg/kg
was selected as the optimum dose to use in the time-course
study. Animals were sacrificed before dosing (0 h) and at 2, 8,
and 24 h after dosing. One of the homozygous knockout mice

most severe lesion that occurred in the wild-type mice was only

APAP. These data clearly show that nrf2 knockout mice are
more sensitive to APAP toxicity than wild-type animals.
Time-Course Study
died between 8 and 24 h after receiving the 300 mg/kg APAP
dose; however, this dose was not lethal to the other genotypes
tested.
Plasma ALT level markedly increased in the homozygous
knockout mice at 8 h after dosing, although the change was
not statistically significant because of large interindividual
differences among animals. On the other hand, wild-type
mice showed only a marginal increase after 24 h (Fig. 3A).
No significant changes in ALT levels were detected in
heterozygous mice at any of the time points tested. These
results indicate that hepatic damage occurs earlier in 
homozygous knockout mice compared to wild-type animals.
However, since the only histopathological change detected
in the latter was slight hepatocellular necrosis, even after
24 h (Table 2), it is possible that the hepatic injury in the
wild-type mice after 8 h was too subtle to be detected by the
analysis of ALT.
Hepatic NPSH levels significantly decreased in mice of
all genotypes after 2 h (Fig. 3B). Specifically, NPSH content
measured 2 h after APAP administration was 29, 25, and
10% of those measured before dosing (after overnight 
fast-ing) in the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous
knockout mice, respectively. The result is consistent with
previous findings which showed a decline in hepatic NPSH
levels at early time points after APAP exposure (Brady et
al., 1988). After 8 h, NPSH in the livers of the wild-type and
heterozygous knockout mice recovered and even became
higher than the pre-dose levels, suggesting complete 
recovery from the effect of APAP treatment subsequent to over-FIG.

a Includes one that died between 8 and 24 h.
Immunohistochemical Detection of APAP in the Liver
Since the binding of an APAP metabolite to cellular proteins
represents an important early event in its hepatotoxicity, the
levels of APAP-bound proteins in the livers of wild-type and
homozygous knockout mice were examined. 
Immunohisto-chemical staining, using an anti-APAP antibody, was 
performed on mice that had been sacrificed 2 h after dosing with
300 mg/kg APAP. Positive staining for APAP was detected in
the centrilobular hepatocytes of homozygous knockout mice,
but not in hepatocytes in other regions, nor in livers of 
wild-type mice (Fig. 5). These results suggest that a greater extent of
APAP-protein adduct formation occurs in livers of 
homozygous knockout mice compared to those of wild-type mice after
the same level of APAP exposure.
Baseline Activities of APAP Metabolism
The amount of the reactive APAP metabolite that can bind
to cellular proteins depends on both its activation and 
detoxi-night fasting, whereas values remained low in the 
homozygous knockout mice. Hepatic NPSH content of the latter
after 24 h was still at the pre-dose level, indicating that an
early decrease in NPSH in mice lacking Nrf2 is followed by
slow or insufficient recovery.
Histopathological examination revealed a degeneration in
centrilobular hepatocytes with small cytoplasmic vacuoles
(grade: 6) in all homozygous knockout mice after 2 h, while
most wild type and heterozygous knockout mice showed no
abnormality at this time point (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Various
degrees of centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis became 
apparent in all homozygous knockout mice after 8 h, but not in mice
of other genotypes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
nrf2 knockout mice exhibit similar time-course changes of
toxicity as those seen in wild-type mice exposed to higher
doses of APAP (Brady
et al., 1988; Cohen, 1998; Mitchell,
1973),
thus indicating a shared underlying mechanism of 
toxicity.

fication by processes of drug metabolism. To compare the
metabolic activity in nrf2 homozygous knockout mice with that
in wild-type mice, cytochrome P450 content, UDP-GT 
activity, and NPSH level were examined. In the livers of 
homozygous knockout mice, hepatic UDP-GT activity and NPSH
content were reduced to 64 and 82% of that in wild-type mice,
respectively (Fig. 6). In contrast, the cytochrome P450 content
in the livers of knockout and wild-type mice was similar. These
results suggest that Nrf2 affects basal activity of some 
pathways of APAP metabolism.
One plausible explanation for these differences in metabolic
activity is the transcriptional shut-off of drug-metabolizing
enzyme and antioxidant genes. To address this question, we
measured the mRNA levels of Ugt1a6 and the heavy and light
chains of gGCS in the livers of the mice by Northern blot
analysis. The mRNA levels of Ugt1a6 and the gGCS heavy
chain in the livers of the homozygous knockout mice were
lower than were those in the wild-type mice (56 and 64%,
respectively: Fig. 7), with a statistical significance of p # 0.05.
On the other hand, the mRNA level of the gGCS light chain
was only slightly less than that found in the control mice
(88%).
We also analyzed the expression of the above genes 2 h after
exposure to APAP to assess whether the induction of these
genes affected the sensitivity of the mice to APAP. However,
no induction of these genes was detected in mice of either
genotype at this time point (data not shown).

Nrf2, which belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZip) 
transcription factor family, has been implicated as a key molecule involved
in antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-mediated gene 
expression. In order to examine the role of Nrf2 in protection against
xenobiotic toxicity, the sensitivity of nrf2 knockout mice to 
acetaminophen (N-acetyl-4-aminophenol (APAP)) was analyzed. The
saturation of detoxification pathways after high levels of exposure
to APAP is known to induce hepatotoxicity. Two factors 
important in its detoxification are UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-
GT), an ARE-regulated phase-II drug-metabolizing enzyme, and
glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant molecule whose synthesis 
depends on ARE-regulated g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gGCS).
Two- to 4-month-old male mice were orally administered a single
dose of APAP at 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. Doses of 300 mg/kg
APAP or greater caused death in the homozygous knockout mice
only, and those that survived showed a greater severity in hepatic
damage than the wild-type mice, as demonstrated by increased
plasma alanine aminotransferase activity, decreased hepatic 
non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) content, and centrilobular 
hepatocellular necrosis. The high sensitivity of Nrf2-deficient mice was
confirmed from observations made at 0, 2, 8, and 24 h after dosing
with 300 mg/kg APAP; increased anti-APAP immunoreactivity
was also noted in their livers at 2 h. Untreated homozygous
knockout mice showed both a lower UDP-GT activity and NPSH
content, which corresponded to decreased mRNA levels of
UDP-GT (Ugt1a6) and the heavy chain of gGCS, respectively.
These results show that Nrf2 plays a protective role against APAP
hepatotoxicity by regulating both drug metabolizing enzymes and
antioxidant genes through the ARE.

Drug metabolizing enzymes and antioxidant systems 
represent 2 major defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.
Electrophiles, radicals, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
often generated as intermediates or by-products of xenobiotic
metabolism. These molecules, if not properly eliminated, 
provoke lipid peroxidation and oxidation of DNA and other 
cellular components, which results in various acute and chronic
tissue injuries, carcinogenesis, and aging (Halliwell et al.,
1995a,b; Martin et al., 1996; Slaga, 1995). Accumulation of
these harmful oxidants in the cell is prevented through the
actions of small antioxidant molecules such as GSH and 
vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1
(HO-1), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Rautalahti
and Huttunen, 1993; Sen, 1995). Drug metabolizing enzymes,
such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), work in concert with
antioxidant systems by metabolizing electrophiles and 
xenobiotics, and some of the molecules involved in these 2 defense
mechanisms are induced simultaneously in response to 
xenobiotic exposure (Prestera et al., 1995). Such concerted gene
induction of drug metabolizing and antioxidant defense 
systems occurs through a common regulatory region called the
ARE (antioxidant responsive element) or EpRE (electrophile
responsive element) (Buetler et al., 1995; Prestera and Talalay,
1995).
While searching for proteins that regulate expression of the
b-globin gene during differentiation, the Nrf family of 
transcription factors was identified. Originally, Nrf2 was isolated
in 1994 from a human K562 erythroid cell line and in 1995
from a chicken erythroid cDNA library (HD3) (Itoh et al.,
1995; Moi et al., 1994). The designation Nrf2 (NF-E2 related
factor 2) was derived from the known transcription factor p45
subunit of NF-E2 (Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2), with which it
shows high sequence homology. Within the family of bZip
transcription factors, Nrf2, p45 NF-E2, and their homologues
constitute a discrete subfamily whose members share regions
of homology with that of the Drosophila Cap’n’Collar (CNC)
protein (Chan et al., 1993; Itoh et al., 1995; Kobayashi et al.,
169
170
1999; Moi et al., 1994). While the expression of p45 is limited
to erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, Nrf2 is widely 
expressed in tissues that include muscle, kidney, lung, intestine,
and liver (Itoh et al., 1995; Moi et al., 1994). Furthermore,
elimination of Nrf2 expression does not influence 
erythropoi-esis (Chan et al., 1996; Itoh et al., 1997; Kuroha et al., 1998).
Thus, until recently, the precise function of Nrf2 was unknown.
The fact that the Nrf2 binding site, namely the NF-E2 binding
motif or MARE (Maf-recognition element), is highly similar to
the ARE, and that its tissue-specific expression is most similar
to that of ARE-regulated genes led to the speculation that Nrf2
is an important regulator of ARE-mediated gene expression
(Itoh et al., 1997; Venugopal and Jaiswal, 1996).
The genes that were first shown to be controlled by Nrf2 in
vivo encode drug-metabolizing enzymes such as GST and
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) (Itoh et al., 1997); these
genes are inducible by the antioxidant butylated 
hydroxyanisole (BHA) which acts through the ARE present in their 
regulatory regions. Dietary administration of 0.7% BHA for 16 to
20 days greatly impaired the induction of NQO1 and 3 classes
of GST (Alpha, Mu, and Pi) in both the liver and intestine of
homozygous nrf2 knockout mice compared to their 
heterozygous littermates (Itoh et al., 1997). It was recently 
demonstrated that detoxification-enzyme genes are not unique in their
regulation by Nrf2. For example, Nrf2 was shown to be 
essential for the induction of HO-1, peroxiredoxin MSP23, and the
cystine transporter (Xc2) by electrophilic agents in mouse 
peritoneal macrophages (Ishii et al., 2000). HO-1 and 
peroxiredoxin have antioxidative activities, whereas Xc2 increases the
intracellular cysteine necessary for GSH synthesis. The 
involvement of Nrf2 in the regulation of HO-1 and gGCS, an
enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthetic
pathway of GSH, has also been reported by other investigators
(Alam
et al., 1999; Moinova and Mulcahy, 1999). The 
requirement of Nrf2 in the regulation of such genes was further
confirmed by the depressed expression of UDP-GT (Ugt1a6),
catalase, and SOD1 observed in nrf2 knockout mice (Chan and
Kan, 1999).
The molecular mechanism of Nrf2 activation by reactive
electrophiles has partially been clarified (Ishii et al., 2000; Itoh
et al., 1999). Keap1, a homologue of the Drosophila actin
binding protein Kelch, binds to the N-terminal Neh2 domain of
Nrf2, thereby retaining this transcription factor in the 
cytoplasm (Adams et al., 2000; Itoh et al., 1999; Xue and Cooley,
1993). Treatment of cells with reactive electrophiles 
counteracts this sequestration of Nrf2 by Keap1, such that Nrf2 
trans-locates
to the nucleus and upregulates ARE-mediated 
transcription.
Considering its function, Nrf2 is expected to play an 
important role in the defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.
In fact, the high sensitivity of nrf2 knockout mice to butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT)-induced pulmonary injury has recently
been reported (Chan and Kan, 1999); the mechanism of their
high sensitivity was, however, not clearly demonstrated. APAP
ENOMOTO ET AL.
was used as a chemical model in the present study to examine
the mechanism by which Nrf2 plays a protective role against
the toxicity of xenobiotics and to elucidate the relationship
between Nrf2-regulated gene expression and such protection.
APAP is widely used in tablet form for its antipyretic and
analgesic properties, and its metabolic pathways are well 
characterized (Cohen et al., 1998). At low doses, the majority of
APAP is readily conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate
and subsequently eliminated. A small portion of APAP 
undergoes biotransformation by cytochrome P450s to an 
electrophilic quinoneimine that nonenzymatically reacts with GSH for
excretion. Exposure to high doses of APAP saturates the 
glucuronidation and sulfation pathways and depletes the GSH
pool, thus enabling the reactive APAP intermediate to bind to
important intracellular macromolecules and result in 
cytotox-icity. Both the ARE-regulated phase II drug-metabolizing 
enzyme UDP-GT, and the antioxidant molecule GSH, whose
synthesis depends on the ARE-regulated gGCS enzyme, are
important in the detoxification of APAP.
In the present study, we demonstrated that nrf2 knockout
mice are highly sensitive to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity as a
result of a lowered activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes and
antioxidant systems, which represent the major Nrf2-regulated
defense mechanisms against xenobiotic toxicity.

FIG. 8. The effects of knocking out nrf2 on APAP hepatotoxicity. Nrf2 
affects UDP-GT activity and GSH (NPSH) level by controlling the expression 
of Ugt1a6 and gGCS genes, respectively. In nrf2 knockout mice, 
more APAP 
is biotransformed to the reactive metabolite, NAPQI, due to the low UDP-GT 
activity. Elimination of NAPQI by conjugation with GSH is also decreased 
because of the low GSH level. White arrows indicate the changes that occur 
with loss of Nrf2.
