Abstract
There is growing evidence that severe decline of skeletal muscle mass and function with age
may bemitigated by exercise and dietary supplementation with protein and amino acid 
ingredient technologies. The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of the leucine
catabolite, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, and
to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with HMB, the amino acid β-alanine and
the combination thereof, on muscle contractility in a preclinical model of pre-sarcopenia. In
C2C12 myotubes, HMB enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release beyond 
vehicle control in the presence of all SR agonists tested (KCl, P<0.01; caffeine, P = 0.03; 
ionomycin, P = 0.03). HMB also improved C2C12 myoblast viability (25 μMHMB, P = 0.03) and
increased proliferation (25 μMHMB, P = 0.04; 125 μMHMB, P<0.01). Furthermore, an
ex vivomuscle contractility study was performed on EDL and soleus muscle from 19month
old, male C57BL/6nTacmice. For 8 weeks, mice were fed control AIN-93M diet, diet with
HMB, diet with β-alanine, or diet with HMB and β-alanine. In β-alanine fed mice, EDL muscle
showed a 7% increase in maximum absolute force compared to the control diet (202 ± 3vs.
188± 5 mN, P = 0.02). At submaximal frequency of stimulation (20 Hz), EDL frommice fed
HMB plus β-alanine showed an 11% increase in absolute force (88.6 ± 2.2 vs. 79.8 ± 2.4 mN,
P = 0.025) and a 13% increase in specific force (12.2 ± 0.4 vs. 10.8 ± 0.4 N/cm2, P = 0.021).
Also in EDLmuscle, β-alanine increased the rate of force development at all frequencies
tested (P<0.025), while HMB reduced the time to reach peak contractile force (TTP), with a
significant effect at 80 Hz (P = 0.0156). In soleus muscle, all experimental diets were 
associated with a decrease in TTP, compared to control diet. Our findings highlight beneficial effects
of HMB and β-alanine supplementation on skeletal muscle function in aging mice.

HMB and β-Alanine Supplementation in Skeletal Muscle
Introduction
Aging results in the progressive decline of many physiological processes including cognition
[1], basal metabolic rate [2], cardiac output [3], pulmonary function [4] and neuromuscular
activity [5]. Particularly debilitating is the severe decline in skeletal muscle mass and function
with age that occurs in a subset of elders, also known as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a 
contributing factor in up to 85.6% of disability cases in elderly men and 26% in elderly women, 
accounting for as much as 26.2 billion dollars in health care related costs in 2000 [6]. Sarcopenia is
characterized by dramatic changes in body composition, including gradual loss of skeletal 
muscle tissue and replacement by adipose tissue and fibrosis, resulting in decreased muscle strength
and power [7,8]. Muscle weakness and frailty leads to an elevated risk of falls and injury among
older persons, with increased incidence of mobility disability, loss of independence, diminished
quality of life, and a host of secondary diseases [8,9]. Studies in mice, rats and humans show
that these age-related changes in muscle strength are multidimensional and can only be 
partially explained by atrophy and loss of muscle tissue [10,11]. Additional factors contributing to
muscle weakness include loss and dysmorphology of motor units [12], reduced myofiber cross
sectional area, increased non-contractile tissue, reduced satellite cell activity [13] and altered
myocellular calcium homeostasis [14-18]. These size-independent factors highlight the 
importance of maintaining muscle quality (strength per unit of muscle mass) during aging, over 
muscle quantity alone.
Resistance exercise is an effective treatment for countering muscle mass and strength losses
in elderly and sarcopenic individuals [8,19-22]. However, regular exercise is not always feasible
for elderly adults, who may be more susceptible to injury and prolonged recovery, and 
especially those with mobility disability or other chronic diseases [8,23]. Additionally, 
pharmacological and dietary interventions have been implemented to counter muscle loss with aging
[8,24,25]. There is a growing body of evidence showing that dietary supplementation with 
protein [26], branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) [27], and even amino acid metabolites [28]
can mitigate sarcopenia when taken alone or in combination with resistance training. However,
mechanisms of action and synergies for some of these interventions are not well understood.
One promising dietary intervention is beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a 
metabolite of leucine, an essential BCAA. It is estimated that 5% of leucine metabolism results in 
production of HMB in vivo [29], while the majority of leucine catabolites are shunted toward
production of HMG-CoA, which is either converted to acetyl-CoA for tricarboxylic acid
cycling or possibly utilized for cholesterol biosynthesis [30]. In rats, Pinheiro et al 
demonstrated that HMB supplementation increased in situ gastrocnemius muscle tetanic force 
production and resistance to fatigue [31]. Also in rats, Alway et al demonstrated that HMB
enhanced satellite cell activity and proliferation following muscle unloading [32]. Furthermore,
HMB treatment has been reported to act on markers of muscle protein turnover by both
decreasing muscle catabolism through modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic
pathway and stimulating muscle protein synthesis via mTOR/p70S6k, IGF, MAPK/ERK or
PI3/Akt pathways [32-38]. In myoblast culture, HMB has been shown to induce expression of
the proliferation marker MyoD and the differentiation markers MEF2 and myogenin [34].
HMB initially gained traction as a dietary aid through sports performance studies in 
physically active male and female young adults [39]. HMB has since been demonstrated to promote
muscle mass, strength, power, or physical performance or reduce skeletal muscle atrophy in
elderly subjects [40-44]. HMB supplementation also prevented the loss of lean mass in a
human study of 10 days of bed rest [45], and has shown similar efficacy in experimental models
of cancer cachexia [37,46-48]. On the other hand, several studies, namely in strength-trained

HMB and β-Alanine Supplementation in Skeletal Muscle
athletes, do not support these results and may reflect differences in dose and duration of HMB
supplementation or total protein intake [49-51].
Another hopeful dietary ingredient to counteract age-related loss of strength is beta-alanine
(β-alanine)-a non-proteinogenic amino acid most abundant in the central nervous system and
skeletal muscle. In muscle, β-alanine and L-histidine combine to form the myoprotective 
dipep-tide carnosine [52,53]. As a dietary supplement, β-alanine has been shown to enhance physical
exercise capacity and the threshold for fatigue in both young [54] and elderly humans [55,56],
possibly via carnosine’s enhanced intramyofibrillar H+ buffering during exercise-induced 
metabolic acidosis. A recent study in human skinned muscle myofibers [57], as well as studies in
rat [58] and other non-mammalian species [59], provide compelling evidence that carnosine
enhances the intrinsic sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium in a dose-dependent
manner. Additionally, elevated intramuscular β-alanine and carnosine levels, achieved through
dietary supplementation in mice, correlated with both increased resistance to fatigue in soleus
muscle and enhanced excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in the extensor digitorum longus
(EDL) muscle through a leftward shift (10-31% higher forces) of the force-frequency curve
[60]. In some studies, though, β-alanine supplementation did not show an impact on muscle
carnosine concentrations or physical exercise capacity [61-63].
The primary objective of the present study was to test for an interaction between dietary
HMB and β-alanine supplementation on muscle strength, muscle quality, and resistance to and
recovery from fatiguing stimulations in a mouse model of pre-sarcopenia. We predicted that
dietary intervention with HMB would increase muscle force through improved myofibrillar
protein accretion, while β-alanine would improve muscle quality and resistance to and 
recovery from fatigue via enhanced E-C coupling. We also hypothesized an additive benefit of HMB
and β-alanine co-supplementation, in particular with regard to muscle strength and muscle
quality. We also tested whether HMB treatment had an effect on proliferation and intracellular
calcium handling in differentiated murine C2C12 myotubes.
Materials and Methods
Cell viability and proliferation
To assess the effect of HMB on C2C12 myoblast viability, the Trypan blue exclusion assay was
performed. C2C12 myoblasts were plated in non-coated 6-well plates at a density of 1600 cells per
cm2 and synchronized at G0/G1 for 24 hours under conditions of serum deprivation [1% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM]. Media was then switched to low serum (3% FBS) or normal
serum (10% FBS) proliferation media containing either 25 or 125 μMHMB free acid or an 
equivalent volume of PBS (vehicle control). After 48 hours and 72 hours of proliferation, cells were
trypsinized, stained with Trypan blue (catalog #1691049, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA)
and counted manually using a hemocytometer (catalog #1492, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA,
USA). Cell viability was calculated as the percent of unstained cells [64,65]. The experiment was
repeated 3 times. To determine the effect of HMB on C2C12 myoblast proliferative capacity, the
Scepter™ automated cell counter (EMDMillipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used. C2C12 myoblasts
were plated in non-coated 24-well plates at a density of 1600 cells per cm2 and synchronized at
G0/G1 for 24 hours under conditions of serum deprivation (1% FBS in DMEM). Media was then
switched to proliferation media (10% FBS in DMEM) supplemented with either 25 μM or
125 μMHMB or an equivalent volume of PBS. At 48 hours of proliferation, cells were trypsinized
and counted using the Scepter™ assay. To obtain the most accurate cell count, the results were
gated to exclude cellular debris [66]. Free acid HMB (catalog #55453, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) was used in all cell culture studies, whereas calciumHMBmonohydrate was used in
the in vivo animal study. Data is presented as mean ± SEM.

Fura-2 monitoring of intracellular Ca2+
For quantitative measurements of intracellular [Ca2+] in cultured myoblasts, we employed
methods previously developed and described by the Brotto Laboratory [64,67]. C2C12 
myoblasts were plated on 25 mm2 glass cover slips at a density of 8000 cells per cm2 and allowed to
differentiate into myotubes by treating the cells for 7 days with differentiation media (2.5%
horse serum in DMEM) containing either 25 μM or125 μMHMB or vehicle control. After 7
days of differentiation, the myotubes were loaded with 4 μM Fura-2-AM for 40 minutes, then
washed, at which time Fura-2 was allowed to de-esterify. As myotube motion artifacts are 
associated with intracellular Ca2+ release, 10 μMN-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (Sigma-Aldrich),
a specific myosin II inhibitor, was applied for 20 min. The cells were then mounted on an
inverted microscope equipped with a dual-wavelength (excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm)
spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ, USA) which was used
to determine the change in magnitude of intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to KCl, 
caffeine, and ionomycin. Specifically, cells were perfused for 2 min each with 80 mM KCl, 
followed by 20 mM caffeine and finally 10 μM ionomycin. The cells were washed with
physiological buffer and allowed to recover to normal resting calcium levels between each
chemical stimulation. The use of KCl, caffeine and ionomycin provide information on 
depolar-ization-induced calcium release, calcium-induced calcium release and total sarcoplasmic 
reticulum calcium storage [68], respectively. Data is presented as mean ± SEM.
Animals
All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use 
Committees at the University of Missouri Kansas City (Kansas City, MO, USA). Male virgin C57BL/
6NTac mice (8 mice each of ages 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16 and 16.5 months; 48 mice total) were
purchased from Taconic Farms, Inc. (Germantown, NY, USA) and housed individually with
ad libitum access to food and water and a 12 h/day light cycle for the duration of the study. All
Mice were fed normal chow while acclimating to the facility and aged to 17 months, followed
by 2 weeks of acclimation to control purified diet (AIN-93M diet, catalog TD.94048, Harlan
Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA). At this point, the mice were distributed across 4
experimental groups fed control purified diet, purified diet containing calcium 
HMBmonohy-drate (514 mg/kg bw, hereafter referred to as HMB), purified diet containing β-alanine (411
mg/kg bw), or the combination of HMB and β-alanine (HMB: 514 mg/kg; β-alanine: 411 mg/
kg bw). HMB (LOT# DO42364, Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and β-alanine (LOT#
109782, Yuki Gosei Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were provided by Abbott Nutrition
(Columbus, OH, USA). Mice were fed experimental diets for 8 weeks. Food intake and body
weight were recorded daily during the first week of dietary supplementation (to test for need to
pair feed), and then on a weekly basis thereafter. Pair feeding was not necessary, and no mice
died during the course of the study. Following the dietary intervention period, mice were 
sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the EDL and soleus muscles were carefully removed for 
contractility analysis, as previously reported [69]. All mice were 19 months old at sacrifice.
Ex vivomuscle contractility
Dissected intact EDL and soleus muscles were immediately placed in a dish containing a
HEPES Ringer solution (143 mMNaCl; 5 mM KCl; 1.8 mMMgCl2; 10 mMHEPES; 2.5 mM
CaCl2; pH 7.40) with 10 mM glucose. This solution was continuously aerated with 100% O2.
This experimental bathing solution was used to tightly control pH, and our results show that
maximal tetanic forces are within the range of normalized forces reported for bathing solutions
that optionally use bicarbonate and phosphate and a mixture of CO2 and O2 [69]. These results

HMB and β-Alanine Supplementation in Skeletal Muscle
are also in agreement with our previous studies on the effects of hypoxia and hypoxia-induced
fatigue in diaphragm muscles from mice [70]. EDL and soleus muscles were mounted vertically
between two stimulating platinum electrodes (Monrovia, CA, USA) and immersed in a 25 ml
bathing chamber containing the Ringer solution. Via the tendons, the muscles were suspended
from adjustable isometric force transducers above the chambers and secured to the base of the
tissue support within the chambers. The analog output of the force transducer was digitized,
stored and analyzed with PowerLab1 Software (ADInstruments Inc., Colorado Springs, CO,
USA). For each muscle the stimulatory voltage was provided by a S8800 dual pulse digital 
stimulator (Grass Products, West Warwick, RI, USA) (pulse duration, 1 ms; train duration, 500
ms). Optimal muscle length (L0) was first determined for each muscle by lengthening the 
muscle until tetanic stimulations of 100 Hz at an interval of 1 min produced maximal force. 
Equilibration: Next the intact EDL and soleus muscles were allowed a 30 minute equilibration period
during which time they were stimulated with pairs of alternating high (80 Hz) and low (20 Hz)
frequency pulse-trains administered with a periodicity of 1 min to mimic normal muscle 
activity. Utilization of the proposed paradigm of stimulation helps with the study of the relative
contributions of the contractile proteins (80Hz) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (20Hz) to 
contractile function [69,71]. Force-Frequency Relationship: Following equilibration, the EDL and
soleus muscles were subjected to stimulation with frequencies ranging from 1-130 Hz with a
periodicity of 1 min to generate the force vs. frequency (FF) relationship. The peak force of
each contraction at the different stimulation frequencies were used to plot the force-frequency
relationship. Fatigue: Next, to induce fatigue, the EDL and soleus muscles were stimulated with
pairs of alternating high (80 Hz) and low (20 Hz) frequency pulse trains with a periodicity of 1
sec for 5 min. The extent of fatigue was determined as the percent of force remaining after the
5 min fatiguing protocol (relative to force at 80Hz and 20Hz just prior to fatiguing 
stimula-tions). Recovery from fatigue: Immediately following the fatiguing protocol, the EDL and soleus
muscles were allowed 30 min recovery period during which time alternating stimulatory trains
of high (80 Hz) and low (20 Hz) frequency were applied with a periodicity of 1 min. The 
muscles were then allowed a second 30 min recovery period with 5mM caffeine added to the 
chamber bath to gauge overall EC coupling during the recovery period [14,68,69]. Although caffeine
may exert its effects via a combination of sites within the muscle (Ryr Ca2+ leak, SR Ca2+ pump
rate, contractile machinery Ca2+ sensitivity), the level of muscle force recovery observed in the
presence of caffeine indicates that the effects are likely due to Ca2+ availability during EC 
coupling [72,73]. Force data: Muscle force is reported as absolute force (mN) and force normalized
to muscle physiological cross sectional area (N/cm2) as previously reported by our group
[69,74,75]. Slope data: The slope of the rising edge of muscle contractions was measured 0-31
ms after the start of the peak. Time to peak data: Calculated as the time (ms) it took to reach
peak force from the start of a muscle contraction. Tau data: Tau was calculated from 90%-0%
of peak height during the relaxation phase of muscle contractions. All data is presented as
mean ± SEM.

Statistical Analysis
In vitro cell studies. In vitro cell studies were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) looking at the main effect with P<0.05 considered significant.
Contractility. Data points that were three standard deviations away from the mean were
considered outliers and removed from the data set. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted
to test for the normality assumption of the outcomes variables. All variables passed the 
normality test under the significance level of 0.05. A Mixed model approach was conducted to test for
the treatment effect while accounting for the repeated measures on the same individual.
5 / 19
Pairwise contrasts were estimated and tested for significance between different treatments. Due
to the multiple comparisons of the contrasts, a more strict alpha level of 0.025 was used to
establish the statistical significance.
Results
In vitro cell studies
The viability of C2C12 myoblasts, under conditions of low serum/cell starvation and normal
serum, was significantly enhanced after 48 hours of proliferation in the presence of 25 μM
HMB compared to control (Fig 1A and 1B). We did not observe any significant increases in
cell viability beyond 48 hours of proliferation under these conditions. HBM treatment at
125 μM had no effect on cell viability. Both doses of HMB (25 μM and 125 μM) enhanced
C2C12 myoblast proliferation after 48 hours in media containing 10% serum (Fig 1C). These
results were obtained using an automated cell counter.
Next, we monitored intracellular calcium levels ([Ca+2]i) under resting conditions, followed
by consecutive sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca+2 release stimulation with 80 mM KCl, 20 mM
caffeine, and 10 μM ionomycin in differentiated C2C12 myoblasts (Fig 2A). Myoblasts were 
differentiated for 7 days into multinucleate myotubes in the presence of both 25 μM and 125 μM
HMB. Myotubes differentiated with 25 μMHMB displayed a slight but significant increase in
the resting level of cytosolic calcium compared to control myotubes (P<0.01, one-way
ANOVA) (Fig 2B). These myotubes also released significantly more calcium in response to
ionomycin (P = 0.026, one-way ANOVA) but displayed similar responses to KCl and caffeine
when compared to control myotubes (Fig 2C). In addition, 125 μMHMB was able to induce an
overall significantly larger SR Ca+2 release for all three agonists, described as the change from
baseline of the Fura-2 ratio compared to control (KCl, P<0.01; Caffeine, P = 0.032; Ionomycin,
P = 0.03, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2C). It is also noticiable that under control conditions there is
a significant decrease in calcium release from the consecutive challlenges of the cells to the
three calcium releasing agents (Fig 2C, bracketed comparisons). In contrast, both 25 μM
125 μMHMB treatment spared the cells from this decline in calcium release (Fig 2C, bracketed
comparisons).
Ex vivo contractility
A total of 48 late middle-aged male mice were fed control purified diet, diet plus HMB, diet
plus β-alanine, or diet plus the combination of HMB and β-alanine. Fig 3A shows a timeline
for the dietary intervention study performed on these mice. During the 8 weeks of dietary 
supplementation, there were no significant differences in body weight or food intake across the 4
experimental groups. The range in average body weight across all four experimental groups
was 42.8-44.1 g. At the end of study, muscle wet weights and optimal lengths showed no 
differences across the four experimental groups (Table 1).
Included in the contractility analysis were 12 animals per group, with 24 EDL muscles and
24 soleus (SOL) muscles analyzed per group (muscles from both hindlimbs per mouse were
tested). Representative data from a contractility experiment are shown in Fig 3B. The force vs.
frequency relationship for the EDL muscles from the β-alanine group revealed a 9% higher
absolute twitch force at 1 Hz (P = 0.009), compared to control muscles (Fig 4A). Dietary HMB
and β-alanine co-supplementation increased both absolute and specific submaximal (20 Hz
stimulation frequency) force generation in EDL muscle by 11.0% (88.6 mN ± 2.2 mN vs. 79.8
mN ± 2.4 mN, P = 0.025) and 13.4% (12.2 N/cm2 ± 0.4 N/cm2 vs. 10.8 N/cm2 ± 0.4 N/cm2,
P = 0.021), respectively, compared to control (Fig 4A and 4B). In addition, maximal tetanic
force in the EDL muscle was 7.3% higher (202.0 mN ± 3.4 mN vs. 188.2 mN ± 4.6 mN,

P = 0.023) in mice supplemented with β-alanine alone (Fig 4A). In the soleus muscle, however,
no significant change in either absolute or specific force generation was detected (Fig 4C and
4D).
We also analyzed kinetic properties of individual muscle contractions from the force-fre-
quency relationship, including the rate of rise of the muscle contraction and the time required
to reach peak contractile force. The rate, or slope, of force development in the EDL muscles

from the β-alanine group was significantly increased at all stimulatory frequencies tested, 
compared to control diet (1-130Hz, P<0.025) (Fig 5A). Twitch (1 Hz) and maximal force (80 Hz)
contractions, which displayed significantly increased force within the β-alanine group, showed
a 12% and 4% increase in the rate of rise, respectively (Control vs β-alanine-twitch: 1.08 ± 0.03
mN/ms vs. 1.22 ± 0.02 mN/ms, P = 0.0022. Control vs β-alanine-80 Hz: 1.56 ± 0.04 vs.

1.70 ± 0.03, P = 0.0072) (Fig 5A). EDL muscles from the HMB group required 58 milliseconds
less time to reach peak maximum contractile force at 80 Hz, compared to control (366.0 ± 20.0
ms vs. 423.9 ± 10.9 ms, P = 0.0156) (Fig 5B). In soleus, no significant differences were detected
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150066.g004
in the slope of contractions between any of the experimental groups (Fig 5D). However, the
time required to produce peak contractile force was reduced in all intervention groups (Fig
5E). HMB alone reduced the time to peak at the stimulatory frequencies of 50-90 Hz (Control
vs HMB-50 Hz: 520 ± 2 ms vs. 514 ± 1 ms, P = 0.0238; 70 Hz: 522 ± 2 ms vs. 513 ± 2 ms,
P = 0.0009; 80 Hz: 524 ± 2 ms vs. 518 ± 1 ms, P = 0.0246; 90 Hz: 521 ± 2 ms vs. 511 ± 1 ms,
P = 0.0004) while contractions from the β-alanine and HMB + β-alanine groups peaked more
quickly at 80-90 Hz (Control vs β-alanine -80 Hz: 524 ± 2 ms vs. 518 ± 2 ms, P = 0.0108; 90
Hz: 521 ± 2 ms vs. 513 ± 2 ms, P = 0.0029) and 90 Hz alone (Control vs HMB+β-alanine -90
Hz: 521 ± 2 vs. 513 ± 2 ms, P = 0.0140), respectively (Fig 5E). There were no significant 
differences detected in the relaxation properties (tau) of either EDL (Fig 5C) or soleus muscles across
experimental groups (Fig 5F).
We also investigated fatigue resistance and recovery from fatiguing contractions in both
EDL and soleus muscles. No changes were observed in the EDL muscle (Fig 6A-6D). Although
not statistically significant, there was a trend for reduction in soleus muscle fatigue in the HMB
and β-alanine groups, and especially the combination thereof (HMB + β-alanine: 5.1% increase
in force after fatigue compared to force prior to fatigue, compared to control diet, P = 0.049) at
the submaximal frequency of stimulation (20 Hz) when compared to control diet (Fig 6E).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effects of both HMB treatment on cultured muscle cells and
dietary HMB supplementation on muscle contractility in late middle-aged mice. In the latter
study, we also tested for an interaction with β-alanine. A well characterized hallmark of aging
skeletal muscle is the diminished capacity for regeneration of muscle after injury or exercise,
and at least one contributing factor is the progressive loss of regeneration-associated satellite
cells and myoblasts [76,77]. These resident mononuclear cells can be modeled in cell culture
through study of isolated murine C2C12 myoblasts. We found that HMB treatment enhanced
C2C12 myoblast proliferation (Fig 1C). In addition, HMB treatment enhanced C2C12 myoblast
viability, even under the unfavorable conditions of serum reduction (Fig 1A and 1B). Taken
together, HMB’s beneficial effects on myoblast viability and proliferation in cell culture align
with a role in vivo on improving the regenerative capacity of myofibers throughout aging, as
noted in a preclinical study of muscle unloading in a rat model [37]. Additionally, we provide
compelling evidence that HMB directly enhances SR calcium release and/or storage in muscle
cells (Fig 2A-2C). HMB treatment increased the KCl-elicited calcium response in fully 
differentiated C2C12 myotubes, suggesting that overall depolarization-coupled calcium release was
enhanced. HMB also increased the caffeine-elicited response, suggesting that the 
calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) properties were enhanced. The larger ionomycin response 
further suggests that HMB increased total Ca+2 storage within the SR of C2C12 myotubes [68,78].
In our Ca+2 imaging system, a ΔFura-2 ratio change of 0.1 units is equivalent to approximately
a [Ca+2]i of 125 nM [79]. Thus, HMB induced an increase of 400-500 nMmore Ca+2 release
from the SR. Another important observation is that HMB appears to spare the cells from the
natural decline in calcium release due to the order effect of consecutive chemical stimulations
(Fig 2C), suggesting that these cells are more intact, or that E-C coupling is preserved. The
absence of an effect of 25 μMHMB treatment on KCl and caffeine-induced calcium release in
myotubes may suggest a sufficient dose requirement for HMB to modulate SR calcium release
in muscle cells. To our knowledge, this is the first ever report of the beneficial effect of HMB
treatment on calcium handling and EC-coupling in muscle cells.
In the late middle-aged mouse contractility study, a key observation is that the dietary HMB
and β-alanine interventions generally affected muscle strength and quality to a greater extent
in the EDL muscle than the soleus. It is well established that the detrimental effects of aging
occur to a greater extent and at an earlier age at onset within muscle groups predominantly
comprised of fast twitch myofibers, such as the EDL muscle, while slow twitch myofiber-pre-
dominant muscles, like the soleus muscle, have a tendency to resist atrophy before late old age
[80,81]. Both the absolute twitch force and maximal tetanic force were increased in the EDL
muscles of mice supplemented with β-alanine (Fig 4A). β-alanine also increased the rate of
force development in EDL at all stimulatory frequencies (Fig 5A). These data suggest that β-
alanine supplementation improved the biomechanical properties of fast twitch myofibers
found at high frequency in the EDL muscle. We also observed an increase in absolute force and
muscle quality (force normalized to muscle cross sectional area) at the lower frequency of 
stimulation (20 Hz) in EDL from mice co-supplemented with HMB and β-alanine. Additionally,
the soleus muscles from the same group exhibited a trend for enhanced resistance to fatiguing
stimulations at 20 Hz, which was not observed in the EDL muscle. Enhanced muscle 
contractility at the frequencies of 1 Hz and 20 Hz is very physiologically relevant, especially when

considering that mammalian skeletal muscles normally function in this range [82,83].
Improved contractile force in fast twitch myofibers as well as enhanced fatigue resistance in
slow twitch myofibers may confer an additive advantage for sustaining skeletal muscle strength
and stamina for mobility.
It is interesting that neither muscle mass nor normalized force in EDL were different for β-
alanine at the maximal stimulation frequencies, yet so for absolute force. It is possible that the
slight relative increase in EDL muscle wet weight observed with β-alanine supplementation,
combined with the slight relative increase in normalized force, interacted to generate the 
statistically significant absolute force change compared to control mice. It is unclear from these
slight changes whether muscle mass or improved contractility were the main driver for
increased absolute force. Regardless of muscle quality, absolute force likely reflects the more
important translational outcome in humans, at least under conditions where hypertrophic 
signals can be activated. Such is the case for many experimental therapies targeting myostatin
blockade, in which case muscle strength is enhanced without improvement of muscle quality
[84]. From a pure force per muscle weight perspective, normalized force data better describe
the contractile physiology of individual myofibers than absolute force data. However, absolute
force data, we believe, are more relevant to whole muscle strength and thus quality of life for an
aging human, for which these studies attempted to model. It is after all, muscle’s absolute force
that facilitates our daily activities. Absolute force data are also important because fibrosis and
intramuscular fat accumulation can muddle interpretation of normalized forced data, at least
when normalized to whole muscle wet weight and even CSA. An alternate analysis is to 
normalize to myofibrillar protein content, however we did not collect such lysates in this study.
We detected an increase in EDL muscle strength in all experimental groups except for the
HMB group, while the soleus muscles supplemented with all experimental diets did not show
any force benefit. On the other hand, HMB supplementation did have an effect on the time it
took to reach peak contractile force in both EDL and soleus muscles (Fig 5B and 5E), 
suggesting enhanced excitation-contraction coupling. We speculate that such an outcome may provide
benefit in a high coordination task such as the rotarod performance test, and this will be the
subject of future study. It is interesting that the effects of HMB in late middle-aged, 19 month
old pre-sarcopenic mice manifest primarily in the kinetic properties of force development,
while the magnitude of force production is unaffected. It is possible that the benefits of HMB
supplementation on the magnitude of muscle force would have been more pronounced in a
mouse model at or greater than 24 months of age, when sarcopenia is predominant and 
significant muscle atrophy has occurred. Other reasons for the lack of HMB effect on muscle force in
this study may pertain to the modest dose (equivalent to 3 g/day in humans) and duration of
supplementation, designed to mimic what could be tested in a human clinical study. Therefore,
additional studies in older mice with additional doses and perhaps more translational in vivo
phenotyping are warranted.
It is also important to note that the effects of the combination of HMB and β-alanine on
force generation in the EDL muscle and fatigue resistance in the soleus at the submaximal 
frequency of stimulation of 20 Hz are greater than the effects of either ingredient alone. It is

unclear exactly how these small molecules interact to produce these complementary effects in
muscle. It has been shown that β-alanine alone can increase calcium sensitivity of contractile
proteins [57,58]. Force generation at 20 Hz is heavily influenced by alterations in E-C coupling
and especially calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [71]. Given that we observed
improved calcium handling upon HMB treatment of cultured myotubes, we speculate that
HMB and β-alanine may act to both improve calcium handling. This effect of HMB, however,
needs to be tested in vivo, and likewise, it will be important to test β-alanine’s effect on calcium
release in our myoblast model.
In summary, we found that β-alanine increased both the 1 Hz and 80 Hz-stimulated 
absolute forces of EDL muscles in late middle-aged mice. Of utmost importance, even producing
more force, these muscles were not prone to damage, even when subjected to our arduous
fatiguing stimulation protocol. β-alanine supplementation also improved the rate of force 
generation at all tested frequencies. When dietary β-alanine was combined with HMB, the increase
in EDL force occurred at physiologically relevant 20 Hz frequency for absolute and normalized
force. In soleus muscle, the effects of each of HMB, β-alanine, and the combination thereof
reduced time to reach peak force. Altogether, these data support the concept that dietary 
supplementation with HMB and β-alanine might help counteract the decline in muscle function
during aging, and preserve muscle function during repetitive bouts of activity. We also report a
novel mechanism of action for HMB in enhancing calcium release from the SR, suggesting that
HMB improves E-C coupling in muscle cells.

Fig 1. HMB enhances C2C12 myoblasts cell viability and proliferation. C2C12 myoblasts were treated with either 25 μM or 125 μM free acid HMB or 
vehicle control. Cell viability was assessed at 48 and 72 hours proliferation using the Trypan Blue exclusion assay. Experiments were performed under 
conditions of both low serum (A) and normal serum (B), (Control, n = 6; 25 μMHMB, n = 3; 125 μMHMB, n = 3, * denotes significant difference compared to 
control: 3% FBS, P = 0.044; 10% FBS, P = 0.031, One-way ANOVA). C) C2C12 myoblasts were treated with 25 μM or125 μMHMB or vehicle control for 48 
hours in proliferation media (10% FBS) at which point total viable cells were counted while gating out cellular debris with the Scepter™ Automated Cell 
Counter (Control, n = 6; 25 μMHMB, n = 3; 125μMHMB, n = 3,* denotes significance compared to control: 25 μMHMB, P<0.042; 125 μMHMB, P<0.01, 
One-way ANOVA). 

Fig 2. HMB increases depolarization-induced calcium release, caffeine induced calcium release from the SR, and total calcium storage of C2C12 
myotubes. Calcium responses frommature C2C12 myotubes differentiated for 7 days in the presence of 25 μM or 125 μMHMB or vehicle were measured 
after perfusion with 80 mM KCl, 20 mM caffeine and 10 μM ionomycin. A) Representative calcium responses from control, 25 μMHMB and 125 μMHMB 
treated C2C12 myotubes measured with Fura-2. Arrows indicate times of perfusion of the cells with KCl, caffeine and ionomycin as well as washout sections 
between chemical stimulations. B) Average resting levels of cytosolic calcium in control, 25 μMHMB and 125 μMHMB treated C2C12 myotubes (n = 15-20 
cells, * denotes P<0.01 compared to control, one-way ANOVA). C) Peak change in the Fura 2 ratio from baseline in control, 25 μMHMB and 125 μMHMB 
treated C2C12 myotubes in response to KCl, caffeine, and ionomycin treatments. (n = 15-20 cells, *denotes significance compared to control: KCl, P<0.01; 
Caffeine, P = 0.032; Ionomycin, P = 0.03, One-way ANOVA). HMB-treated myotubes, but not control, were able to maintain robust release of calcium 
between the first and last chemical treatment as the change in Fura 2 ratio (C) values were significantly decreased between 80 mMKCl and 10 μM ionomycin 
treatment in control myotubes but not in 25and 125 μMHMB treated cells (Fura-2 ratio of 80 mM KCl treatment compared to 10 μM ionomycin in the same 
group: Δ Fura-2 Ratio (C): 25 μMHMB-P = 0.522, 125 μMHMB: P = 0.177, Control-P = 0.017)
