>>>section: conclusion
CONCLUSION: Active antibiotic was released from
coated implants and significantly reduced signs of
osteomyelitic symptoms. Implant coatings were well
tolerated in bone. Further studies with additional
control groups and longer time periods are warranted.
Antibiotic-loaded phosphatidylcholine coatings applied
at the point of care could prevent implant-associated
infection in orthopaedic defects.

Core tip: We report infection preventative results of a
novel antibiotic-loaded coating in a severe 
contaminated model of orthopaedic infection. 
Phosphatidylcho-line coatings loaded with 25% vancomycin, which can
be applied to implants immediately prior to implantation,
significantly reduced staphylococcal adherence to
intramedullary titanium wires in rabbits. Reduction in
bacterial load on implants and in tissue for 
antibiotic-loaded coatings accompanied reduction in swelling and
pus formation. Mild inflammatory responses were noted
with coated implants compared to uncoated infected
controls. This preliminary short term study demonstrates
the clinical potential of these broadly applicable
coatings and the need for further characterization and
development.

METHODS: Phosphatidylcholine coatings loaded with
25% vancomycin were applied to washed and sterilized
titanium wires 20 mm in length. A 10 mm segment
was removed from rabbit radius (total = 9; 5 coated, 4
uncoated), and the segment was injected with 1 × 106
colony forming units (CFUs) of Staphylococcus aureus
(UAMS-1 strain). Titanium wires were inserted through
467

Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
the intramedullary canal of the removed segment and
into the proximal radial segment and the segment
was placed back into the defect. After 7 d, limbs were
removed, X-rayed, swabbed for tissue contamination.
Wires were removed and processed to determine
attached CFUs. Tissue was swabbed and streaked on
agar plates to determine bacteriological score.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Coatings were fabricated by mixing 6 g of purified
phosphatidylcholine (Phospholipon 90G, Lipoid GMB,
Germany) with 2 g of vancomycin through a previously
described process of warming and kneading powdered
antibiotics until the mixture was uniform[22]. The mixture
was loaded into open-ended syringes and sterilized by
low dose (25 kGy) gamma irradiation.
Titanium wire 0.81 mm in diameter (Mcmaster
Carr) was trimmed to 15 cm in length. Titanium wire
was cleaned by washing with dish detergent, after
which it was soaked in 20% nitric acid for 1 h. Wire was
rinsed thoroughly in ultrapure water, sonicated in soapy
water, and rinsed again three times in ultrapure water.
Implants were separately packaged and autoclaved at
468

121 ℃ for 20 min for sterilization.
Animal model
Animal care and use statement: Study protocols were
approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and all appropriate measures were taken to minimize
pain and discomfort.
Nine New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized
with 1-2 cc of a xyalzine/ketamine mixture 
intramu-scularly for a dose range of 3-7 mg/kg xylazine and
30-40 mg/kg ketamine. Rabbits were maintained
on 0.5%-3% isoflurane administered by nose cone
to produce surgical anesthesia and monitored by a
veterinary technician. The right forelimb of each rabbit
was shaved and prepped using a betadine scrub and
rinsed with 70% ethanol. An incision was made on
the anterior surface of the right forelimb through the
epidermis, musculature, and fascia until the radius was
exposed. A 1 cm mid-radial segment was be excised
from the right forelimb using a miniature saw blade
(Exakt, Oklahoma City, OK). The excised segment
was then infected by inoculation of S. aureus [10 µL of
107 colony forming units (CFUs)/mL; UAMS-1 strain]
directly into the intramedullary canal.
Animals were divided into two treatment groups:
Wire with 25% vancomycin-loaded coating (n = 5) or
non-coated controls (n = 4). During surgical procedures
titanium wires in the coated group were coated by
direct manual application of coating through the syringe
applicator. Coated or control wires were inserted into the
medullary canal of the infected segment immediately
after inoculation. Approximately 5 mm of wire extended
through the proximal end of the segment and was
inserted into the medullary canal of the intact proximal
bone. The segment was then replaced in the same
orientation and the wound was closed with sutures.
Rabbits were euthanized after 7 d. Forelimbs were
removed and imaged by X-ray, noting signs of 
inflammation and swelling. A swab of the soft tissue and bone
exposed was taken to determine bacteriological score
of surrounding tissue. The segment was removed for
retrieval of the wire and placed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for further processing. The wire was rinsed in
sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated in
5 mL of PBS for enumeration of viable CFUs attached as
biofilm. The remaining forelimb was also trimmed and
fixed in formalin for histological characterization. Fixed
tissue was decalcified in ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as well
as a modified Gram stain[23]. Images taken at 4 ×
magnification were scored by three independent blinded
reviewers for severity of inflammatory response on a
scale of 0-4.
Statistical analysis
Mann-Whitney nonparametric t tests in Sigma Plot
were used to determine whether there were statistically
Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
significant differences in colony counts in coated wires
compared to uncoated control wires. Mann-Whitney
tests were also used to determine statistical differences
in bacteriological score and histological scores. Using
results of previous studies determining log fold 
reduction of CFUs in response to antimicrobials[24], an a
priori power analysis was performed using Sigma Plot.
Assuming a standard deviation of 1 unit in log-trans-
formed CFU counts, 4 animals per group are required
to have 80% power to detect a difference of 2.5 units
between the control and each of the 4 experimental
treatment groups at a significance level of 5%. The
statistical methods of this study were reviewed by
Jessica Amber Jennings of the University of Memphis.

into the proximal radial segment and the segment
was placed back into the defect. After 7 d, limbs were
removed, X-rayed, swabbed for tissue contamination.
Wires were removed and processed to determine
attached CFUs. Tissue was swabbed and streaked on
agar plates to determine bacteriological score.
RESULTS: Antibiotic-loaded coatings resulted in
significantly reduced biofilm formation (4.7 fold reduction
in CFUs; P  < 0.001) on titanium wires and reduced
bacteriological score in surrounding tissue (4.0 ± 0 for
uncoated, 1.25 ± 0.5 for coated; P = 0.01). Swelling and
pus formation was evident in uncoated controls at the 7
d time point both visually and radiographically, but not
in antibiotic-loaded coatings.
CONCLUSION: Active antibiotic was released from
coated implants and significantly reduced signs of
osteomyelitic symptoms. Implant coatings were well
tolerated in bone. Further studies with additional
control groups and longer time periods are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Biofilm formation on implants continues to be a cause
of orthopaedic infection[1,2]. While the rate of infection in
some orthopaedic implants has been reported to range
from 1%-10%, in some complex orthopaedic trauma
requiring percutaneous devices the rate of infection
may approach 30%[3-5]. Protection of orthopaedic
implants from contamination may be more successful
through prevention of biofilm formation. Because
microbial cells within a biofilm are less metabolically
active and shielded to some degree by exopolymeric
substance, there is a high concentration of persister
cells with resistance to commonly used antibiotics within
biofilm[6-9]. Standard treatment practices of prophylactic
systemic administration of antibiotics may not be
sufficient to inhibit or treat biofilm-based infections
partly due to poor vascularity in injured tissue and partly
due to the increased concentrations of antimicrobials
required for elimination of biofilm[7,10,11].
Local delivery devices have been developed to 
achieve high concentrations of antibiotic within the 
potentially contaminated tissue to target biofilm[12-14]. However,
some have limitations in degradability, implant coverage,
and antibiotic loading, including non-degradable 
polyme-thylmethacrylate bone cement beads[15], degradable
calcium sulfate beads[16], sponge devices[17], and 
injec-table hydrogels[18]. Local delivery coatings directly on
the implant can protect the biomaterial from biofilm
formation[19-21], but may require extensive prefabrication
steps.
We previously described the biofilm inhibitory
nature of phosphatidylcholine coatings loaded with
antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo[22]. When loaded
with antibiotics, this coating applied at the point-of-care
just prior to implantation was shown to reduce biofilm
formation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as prevent biofilm
formation in a polymicrobial model of contamination
with both microorganisms. While proof of principle was
established in a soft-tissue dorsal model of implant
infection, for this study our primary question was
whether antibiotic-loaded coatings could successfully
prevent infection in a contaminated orthopaedic model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Coatings were fabricated by mixing 6 g of purified
phosphatidylcholine (Phospholipon 90G, Lipoid GMB,
Germany) with 2 g of vancomycin through a previously
described process of warming and kneading powdered
antibiotics until the mixture was uniform[22]. The mixture
was loaded into open-ended syringes and sterilized by
low dose (25 kGy) gamma irradiation.
Titanium wire 0.81 mm in diameter (Mcmaster
Carr) was trimmed to 15 cm in length. Titanium wire
was cleaned by washing with dish detergent, after
which it was soaked in 20% nitric acid for 1 h. Wire was
rinsed thoroughly in ultrapure water, sonicated in soapy
water, and rinsed again three times in ultrapure water.
Implants were separately packaged and autoclaved at

121 ℃ for 20 min for sterilization.
Animal model
Animal care and use statement: Study protocols were
approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and all appropriate measures were taken to minimize
pain and discomfort.
Nine New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized
with 1-2 cc of a xyalzine/ketamine mixture 
intramu-scularly for a dose range of 3-7 mg/kg xylazine and
30-40 mg/kg ketamine. Rabbits were maintained
on 0.5%-3% isoflurane administered by nose cone
to produce surgical anesthesia and monitored by a
veterinary technician. The right forelimb of each rabbit
was shaved and prepped using a betadine scrub and
rinsed with 70% ethanol. An incision was made on
the anterior surface of the right forelimb through the
epidermis, musculature, and fascia until the radius was
exposed. A 1 cm mid-radial segment was be excised
from the right forelimb using a miniature saw blade
(Exakt, Oklahoma City, OK). The excised segment
was then infected by inoculation of S. aureus [10 µL of
107 colony forming units (CFUs)/mL; UAMS-1 strain]
directly into the intramedullary canal.
Animals were divided into two treatment groups:
Wire with 25% vancomycin-loaded coating (n = 5) or
non-coated controls (n = 4). During surgical procedures
titanium wires in the coated group were coated by
direct manual application of coating through the syringe
applicator. Coated or control wires were inserted into the
medullary canal of the infected segment immediately
after inoculation. Approximately 5 mm of wire extended
through the proximal end of the segment and was
inserted into the medullary canal of the intact proximal
bone. The segment was then replaced in the same
orientation and the wound was closed with sutures.
Rabbits were euthanized after 7 d. Forelimbs were
removed and imaged by X-ray, noting signs of 
inflammation and swelling. A swab of the soft tissue and bone
exposed was taken to determine bacteriological score
of surrounding tissue. The segment was removed for
retrieval of the wire and placed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for further processing. The wire was rinsed in
sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated in
5 mL of PBS for enumeration of viable CFUs attached as
biofilm. The remaining forelimb was also trimmed and
fixed in formalin for histological characterization. Fixed
tissue was decalcified in ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as well
as a modified Gram stain[23]. Images taken at 4 ×
magnification were scored by three independent blinded
reviewers for severity of inflammatory response on a
scale of 0-4.
Statistical analysis
Mann-Whitney nonparametric t tests in Sigma Plot
were used to determine whether there were statistically
Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
significant differences in colony counts in coated wires
compared to uncoated control wires. Mann-Whitney
tests were also used to determine statistical differences
in bacteriological score and histological scores. Using
results of previous studies determining log fold 
reduction of CFUs in response to antimicrobials[24], an a
priori power analysis was performed using Sigma Plot.
Assuming a standard deviation of 1 unit in log-trans-
formed CFU counts, 4 animals per group are required
to have 80% power to detect a difference of 2.5 units
between the control and each of the 4 experimental
treatment groups at a significance level of 5%. The
statistical methods of this study were reviewed by
Jessica Amber Jennings of the University of Memphis.
RESULTS
After the 7 d implantation period, animals with 
uncoated implants were noted to have characteristics
indicative of inflammation such as swelling (Figure
1), redness, and increased temperature, compared to
those with implants coated with vancomycin-loaded
phosphatidylcholine. Pus formation was evident in
muscle tissue of several animals with uncoated wires.
Bacteriological scores confirmed that there were
statistically significant reductions in bacteria recovered
from surrounding tissue (P = 0.01) (Figure 2). CFU
counts of S. aureus remaining as biofilm on Ti implants
revealed that there were statistically fewer colonies
retrieved from coated implants, 20 ± 21 CFUs vs 6.0
× 105 CFUs in the control group (P < 0.001) (Figure
3). Complete clearance of attached S. aureus biofilm
was achieved in 40% of the coated wires vs 0% in the
control group.
In histological specimens, evidence of inflammatory
cell infiltration was evident in many of the control
groups with confirmed bacterial presence, while 
inflammatory cell presence was minimal in the groups with
vancomycin coating (P < 0.001) (Figure 4). 
Representative histological slides show severe infiltration of
inflammatory cells in uncoated groups and evidence of
Gram-positive staphylococci in the tissue surrounding
the implant and in the cortical bone (Figure 5). Although
some evidence of Gram-positive staphylococci was
observed in the cortical bone of animals with antibiotic
coated implants, the tissue surrounding the implant had
minimal evidence of bacteria.
DISCUSSION
Successful function of orthopaedic implants can be
threatened by infections, which are not always 
prevented by systemic antibiotic treatment[25-27]. Implant
coatings are among the local drug delivery strategies
that aim to prevent or treat colonization of implants with
biofilm bacteria[21,28,29]. The naturally-derived material
phosphatidylcholine has not been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) as a carrier of antibiotics,

of previous preliminary studies[22], this initial study of a
novel antibiotic loaded coating further recommends the
potential of the coating to prevent implant-associated
osteomyelitis.

This study demonstrates significant reduction in
contamination and progression of disease, though some
bacteria were recovered from the cortical bone and
observed in the Gram stains. Any remaining bacteria
could potentially rebound and lead to osteomyelitis.
We chose vancomycin as the first antibiotic to evaluate
in this coated implant model due to the known 
susceptibility of this strain of bacteria[24]. We have 
demonstrated previously that the coating can be loaded with
different antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics such
as amikacin, although the release profile may vary
based on solubility or other chemical properties of the
antimicrobial[22]. In the context of preventing biofilm,
vancomycin has lower efficacy than antibiotics such
as daptomycin[24] though it is commonly used as an
adjunctive therapy in local drug delivery devices or
even sprinkled into a surgical site after implantation of

Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
orthopaedic devices[31-34]. An advantage of this coating is
that it may provide clinicians with a choice of 
antibiotic-or antimicrobial-loaded coating based on patient 
assessment and risk evaluation. Recently, investigations
into biofilm inhibitors such as cis 2-decenoic acid,
D-amino acids, and farnesol have offered potential
therapeutic options to specifically target biofilm[35-37].
The phosphatidylcholine coating could serve as delivery
system for combined therapy with antibiotics and biofilm
inhibitors, since additive and synergistic prevention of
biofilm and bacterial growth have been demonstrated in
vitro[38-42].
The results of this study confirm that the results of
our previous in vitro and soft-tissue in vivo studies of
this coating are applicable within an orthopaedic implant
context. Inflammatory response was typical of normal
infiltration of inflammatory cells during the healing
process[43] and was reduced compared to when active
infection was present. During implantation procedures
used in this study, the manual application of coating
was sufficient to retain antibiotic for local release. In
vitro simulations of implant scenarios or alternative
orthopaedic models[44-46] may be useful in determining
coating retention during intra-cortical implantation
procedures such as fixation nails or bone screws. The
lipid-based coating can be applied to different surfaces,
though differences in adhesion to the surface and
elution from different surfaces have not been fully
characterized. Future studies will evaluate the properties
of the coatings on different surfaces other than metal
commonly used in orthopaedic applications, such as
polyether ether ketone polymer or hydroxyapatite
ceramic biomaterials.
Our results should be interpreted in light of the
limitations of this preliminary study. A short duration with
a small number of samples in each group was selected
for this initial evaluation of only 7 d. For this pilot study,
we powered the study to detect large differences in
remaining bacteria, but this study should be repeated
for robust results. While this model has been used
previously and confirmed to lead to osteomyelitic 
infection without an implant[47,48], previous studies have
monitored disease progression and treatment of existing
infection after 3 or more weeks post-inoculation. Since
the ulnar bone is still intact, the implant does not
provide stability to the defect but provides a surface
on which biofilm can form, so that animals return to
normal activity hours after recovery without the need
for fixation devices. Since the focus of this study was
prevention of osteomyelitis in an implant-associated
infection model, we selected an early time point at
which histological and microbiological differences could
still be observed[49]. Further studies expanding on these
preliminary results should include increased animal
numbers and longer durations of implantation, as well
as non-contaminated control groups for comparison.

Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
The development of this model has been refined
so the strain of S. aureus and the amount of CFUs in
the inoculum results in significant evidence of infection
in more than 75% of rabbits[49]. Although this 
provides consistent results for evaluation of anti-infection
therapy, it may not be representative of the clinical
scenario where infection occurs at much lower rates
and presumably with fewer contaminating bacteria. The
evidence in this study demonstrating that the antibiotic
coating does prevent bacterial growth even in this model
of high levels of contamination indicates the clinical
potential of this coating. Further, while we did observe
histology for uncoated and coated groups to note any
potential inflammatory responses, there were no 
non-antibiotic loaded coatings used as controls or defects
without contamination to monitor inflammatory response
in this preliminary study. Since this material has been
used as a component of bone graft substitutes without
issues of severe inflammation[30], it is expected that a
degradable thin coating on the implant surface would not
lead to negative tissue response and may even stimulate
bone growth and healing around the implant. Further
studies expanding on these preliminary results should
include longer durations of implantation as well as 
non-contaminated control groups for comparison.
In conclusion, vancomycin-loaded 
phosphatidylcholine coatings effectively reduced bacterial biofilm
formation in an orthopaedic implant-associated model
of infection. Local release of antibiotic inhibits bacterial
growth and inhibits biofilm formation on the implant.
These easily-applied coatings can be used at the time
of surgery to prevent orthopaedic infection and improve
patient outcomes.

COMMENTS  COMMENTS
Background
Infections associated with medical implants can pose severe threats to patient
health. Methods to prevent attachment of bacteria and the formation of
biofilm on implants could prevent life-threatening musculoskeletal infections.
Phosphatidylcholine coatings can be loaded with antibiotics to protect the implant
and surrounding tissue from pathogenic microorganisms.
Research frontiers
Phosphatidylcholine is a naturally-derived lipophilic material that forms a thin
layer when manually applied to an implant surface. The point-of-care application
provides versatility for use on various implant types and with many different
types of antimicrobial molecules.
Innovations and breakthroughs
Compared to systemic administration of antibiotics, local delivery provides
high concentrations of therapeutic molecules at the site of injury and potential
contamination. Phosphatidylcholine provides a short-term degradable drug
carrier matrix that can be directly coated on implants. Complete degradability,
as well as implant coverage and biocompatibility, are advantages over other
common local drug delivery devices such as polymethylmethacrylate beads or
calcium sulfate.
Applications
Results suggest that vancomycin-loaded coatings significantly inhibited
staphylococcal growth in a model of implant-associated osteomyelitis, providing
prophylactic drug release to prevent infection.
Terminology
Phosphatidylcholine is an amphiphilic molecule consisting of a polar head group
and fatty acid tails that when purified can be fabricated into a coating material
that leaves a waxy residue on the surface of a biomaterial. Biofilm forms when
bacteria or other microorganisms attach to a surface, such as a metal implant
or damaged tissue, and causes infection that is highly resistant to antibiotics
or immune system clearance. Staphylococcus aureus is among the common
pathogens that cause infections in the musculoskeletal system and can lead to
osteomyelitis, which is infection of bone.
Peer-review
Interesting paper. This is a basic science study with a useful clinical application.

COMMENTS  COMMENTS
Background
Infections associated with medical implants can pose severe threats to patient
health. Methods to prevent attachment of bacteria and the formation of
biofilm on implants could prevent life-threatening musculoskeletal infections.
Phosphatidylcholine coatings can be loaded with antibiotics to protect the implant
and surrounding tissue from pathogenic microorganisms.
Research frontiers
Phosphatidylcholine is a naturally-derived lipophilic material that forms a thin
layer when manually applied to an implant surface. The point-of-care application
provides versatility for use on various implant types and with many different
types of antimicrobial molecules.
Innovations and breakthroughs
Compared to systemic administration of antibiotics, local delivery provides
high concentrations of therapeutic molecules at the site of injury and potential
contamination. Phosphatidylcholine provides a short-term degradable drug
carrier matrix that can be directly coated on implants. Complete degradability,
as well as implant coverage and biocompatibility, are advantages over other
common local drug delivery devices such as polymethylmethacrylate beads or
calcium sulfate.
Applications
Results suggest that vancomycin-loaded coatings significantly inhibited
staphylococcal growth in a model of implant-associated osteomyelitis, providing
prophylactic drug release to prevent infection.
Terminology
Phosphatidylcholine is an amphiphilic molecule consisting of a polar head group
and fatty acid tails that when purified can be fabricated into a coating material
that leaves a waxy residue on the surface of a biomaterial. Biofilm forms when
bacteria or other microorganisms attach to a surface, such as a metal implant
or damaged tissue, and causes infection that is highly resistant to antibiotics
or immune system clearance. Staphylococcus aureus is among the common
pathogens that cause infections in the musculoskeletal system and can lead to
osteomyelitis, which is infection of bone.
Peer-review
Interesting paper. This is a basic science study with a useful clinical application.

DISCUSSION
Successful function of orthopaedic implants can be
threatened by infections, which are not always 
prevented by systemic antibiotic treatment[25-27]. Implant
coatings are among the local drug delivery strategies
that aim to prevent or treat colonization of implants with
biofilm bacteria[21,28,29]. The naturally-derived material
phosphatidylcholine has not been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) as a carrier of antibiotics,

of previous preliminary studies[22], this initial study of a

potential of the coating to prevent implant-associated

This study demonstrates significant reduction in

We chose vancomycin as the first antibiotic to evaluate
in this coated implant model due to the known 
susceptibility of this strain of bacteria[24]. We have 
demonstrated previously that the coating can be loaded with
different antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics such
as amikacin, although the release profile may vary
based on solubility or other chemical properties of the
antimicrobial[22]. In the context of preventing biofilm,
vancomycin has lower efficacy than antibiotics such
as daptomycin[24] though it is commonly used as an
adjunctive therapy in local drug delivery devices or
even sprinkled into a surgical site after implantation of

Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
orthopaedic devices[31-34]. An advantage of this coating is
that it may provide clinicians with a choice of 
antibiotic-or antimicrobial-loaded coating based on patient 
assessment and risk evaluation. Recently, investigations
into biofilm inhibitors such as cis 2-decenoic acid,
D-amino acids, and farnesol have offered potential
therapeutic options to specifically target biofilm[35-37].
The phosphatidylcholine coating could serve as delivery
system for combined therapy with antibiotics and biofilm
inhibitors, since additive and synergistic prevention of
biofilm and bacterial growth have been demonstrated in
vitro[38-42].
The results of this study confirm that the results of
our previous in vitro and soft-tissue in vivo studies of
this coating are applicable within an orthopaedic implant
context. Inflammatory response was typical of normal
infiltration of inflammatory cells during the healing
process[43] and was reduced compared to when active
infection was present. During implantation procedures
used in this study, the manual application of coating
was sufficient to retain antibiotic for local release. In
vitro simulations of implant scenarios or alternative
orthopaedic models[44-46] may be useful in determining
coating retention during intra-cortical implantation
procedures such as fixation nails or bone screws. The
lipid-based coating can be applied to different surfaces,
though differences in adhesion to the surface and
elution from different surfaces have not been fully
characterized. Future studies will evaluate the properties
of the coatings on different surfaces other than metal
commonly used in orthopaedic applications, such as
polyether ether ketone polymer or hydroxyapatite
ceramic biomaterials.
Our results should be interpreted in light of the
limitations of this preliminary study. A short duration with
a small number of samples in each group was selected
for this initial evaluation of only 7 d. For this pilot study,
we powered the study to detect large differences in
remaining bacteria, but this study should be repeated
for robust results. While this model has been used
previously and confirmed to lead to osteomyelitic 
infection without an implant[47,48], previous studies have
monitored disease progression and treatment of existing
infection after 3 or more weeks post-inoculation. Since
the ulnar bone is still intact, the implant does not
provide stability to the defect but provides a surface
on which biofilm can form, so that animals return to
normal activity hours after recovery without the need
for fixation devices. Since the focus of this study was
prevention of osteomyelitis in an implant-associated
infection model, we selected an early time point at
which histological and microbiological differences could
still be observed[49]. Further studies expanding on these
preliminary results should include increased animal
numbers and longer durations of implantation, as well
as non-contaminated control groups for comparison.

Jennings JA et al . Implant coating prevents infection
The development of this model has been refined
so the strain of S. aureus and the amount of CFUs in
the inoculum results in significant evidence of infection
in more than 75% of rabbits[49]. Although this 
provides consistent results for evaluation of anti-infection
therapy, it may not be representative of the clinical
scenario where infection occurs at much lower rates
and presumably with fewer contaminating bacteria. The
evidence in this study demonstrating that the antibiotic
coating does prevent bacterial growth even in this model
of high levels of contamination indicates the clinical
potential of this coating. Further, while we did observe
histology for uncoated and coated groups to note any
potential inflammatory responses, there were no 
non-antibiotic loaded coatings used as controls or defects
without contamination to monitor inflammatory response
in this preliminary study. Since this material has been
used as a component of bone graft substitutes without
issues of severe inflammation[30], it is expected that a
degradable thin coating on the implant surface would not
lead to negative tissue response and may even stimulate
bone growth and healing around the implant. Further
studies expanding on these preliminary results should
include longer durations of implantation as well as 
non-contaminated control groups for comparison.
In conclusion, vancomycin-loaded 
phosphatidylcholine coatings effectively reduced bacterial biofilm
formation in an orthopaedic implant-associated model
of infection. Local release of antibiotic inhibits bacterial
growth and inhibits biofilm formation on the implant.
These easily-applied coatings can be used at the time
of surgery to prevent orthopaedic infection and improve
patient outcomes.

>>>section: results
RESULTS: Antibiotic-loaded coatings resulted in
significantly reduced biofilm formation (4.7 fold reduction
in CFUs; P  < 0.001) on titanium wires and reduced
bacteriological score in surrounding tissue (4.0 ± 0 for
uncoated, 1.25 ± 0.5 for coated; P = 0.01). Swelling and
pus formation was evident in uncoated controls at the 7
d time point both visually and radiographically, but not
in antibiotic-loaded coatings.
RESULTS
After the 7 d implantation period, animals with 
uncoated implants were noted to have characteristics
indicative of inflammation such as swelling (Figure
1), redness, and increased temperature, compared to
those with implants coated with vancomycin-loaded
phosphatidylcholine. Pus formation was evident in
muscle tissue of several animals with uncoated wires.
Bacteriological scores confirmed that there were
statistically significant reductions in bacteria recovered
from surrounding tissue (P = 0.01) (Figure 2). CFU
counts of S. aureus remaining as biofilm on Ti implants
revealed that there were statistically fewer colonies
retrieved from coated implants, 20 ± 21 CFUs vs 6.0
× 105 CFUs in the control group (P < 0.001) (Figure
3). Complete clearance of attached S. aureus biofilm
was achieved in 40% of the coated wires vs 0% in the
control group.
In histological specimens, evidence of inflammatory
cell infiltration was evident in many of the control
groups with confirmed bacterial presence, while 
inflammatory cell presence was minimal in the groups with
vancomycin coating (P < 0.001) (Figure 4). 
Representative histological slides show severe infiltration of
inflammatory cells in uncoated groups and evidence of
Gram-positive staphylococci in the tissue surrounding
the implant and in the cortical bone (Figure 5). Although
some evidence of Gram-positive staphylococci was
observed in the cortical bone of animals with antibiotic
coated implants, the tissue surrounding the implant had
minimal evidence of bacteria.

Abstract
AIM: To test antibiotic-loaded coating for efficacy
in reducing bacterial biofilm and development of 
osteomyelitis in an orthopaedic model of implant infection.
INTRODUCTION
Biofilm formation on implants continues to be a cause
of orthopaedic infection[1,2]. While the rate of infection in
some orthopaedic implants has been reported to range
from 1%-10%, in some complex orthopaedic trauma
requiring percutaneous devices the rate of infection
may approach 30%[3-5]. Protection of orthopaedic
implants from contamination may be more successful
through prevention of biofilm formation. Because
microbial cells within a biofilm are less metabolically
active and shielded to some degree by exopolymeric
substance, there is a high concentration of persister
cells with resistance to commonly used antibiotics within
biofilm[6-9]. Standard treatment practices of prophylactic
systemic administration of antibiotics may not be
sufficient to inhibit or treat biofilm-based infections
partly due to poor vascularity in injured tissue and partly
due to the increased concentrations of antimicrobials
required for elimination of biofilm[7,10,11].
Local delivery devices have been developed to 
achieve high concentrations of antibiotic within the 
potentially contaminated tissue to target biofilm[12-14]. However,
some have limitations in degradability, implant coverage,
and antibiotic loading, including non-degradable 
polymethylmethacrylate bone cement beads[15], degradable
calcium sulfate beads[16], sponge devices[17], and 
injec-table hydrogels[18]. Local delivery coatings directly on
the implant can protect the biomaterial from biofilm
formation[19-21], but may require extensive prefabrication
steps.
We previously described the biofilm inhibitory
nature of phosphatidylcholine coatings loaded with
antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo[22]. When loaded
with antibiotics, this coating applied at the point-of-care
just prior to implantation was shown to reduce biofilm
formation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as prevent biofilm
formation in a polymicrobial model of contamination
with both microorganisms. While proof of principle was
established in a soft-tissue dorsal model of implant
infection, for this study our primary question was
whether antibiotic-loaded coatings could successfully
prevent infection in a contaminated orthopaedic model.
