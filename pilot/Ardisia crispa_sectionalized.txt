Conclusions
Compiling findings from the present study, it is 
noteworthy that in vivo antitumor promoting activity of TQF
was restricted by dosage whereby lower dose of TQF
(10 mg/kg) suppressed DMBA/TPA-induced mice skin
papilloma; whilst higher dose of TQF (100 mg/kg) was
found to potentiate tumor development. This was 
further reinforced by mechanism studies in which the lower
dose (10 mg/kg) was shown to confer antitumor 
promoting effect via significant (P < 0.05) suppression
against LPO, apoptotic index (DNA damage) and 
NF-κB, along with reduction of keratinocyte proliferation.
Based on these results, it is suggested that TQF be
examined at much lower doses in subsequent in vivo
tumorigenesis study until the lowest possible therapeutic
dose is attained.

Extraction, separation and isolation of triterpene-quinone
fraction (TQF)
TQF was isolated from ACRH and its composition was
analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with reference to
compounds provided by Dr. Roslida Abd Hamid, as 
detailed previously [12].
Experimental animals
Male ICR mice (6-8 weeks old), weighing 20-30 g, were
obtained and kept at the animal house of Faculty of
Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia
with ethical approval from the Animal Care and Use
Committee (UPM/FPSK/PADS/BR-UUH/00315). The
mice were housed 10 per cage and fed on standard 
laboratory diet with free access to water. Upon one week
of acclimatization period, the mice were dorsally shaved
with an electric hair clipper for an approximately 2 cm x
2 cm area about 1 cm off tail, three days before the 
commencement of experiment.
Anti-tumor promoting effects of TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/
kg) in two-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis model
A total of 75 mice were allocated into 9 groups.
Group I (vehicle control, n = 10) received topical 
application of acetone (100 μl) throughout the 
experimental period. Group II (carcinogen control, n = 10)
were given a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]an-
thracene (DMBA; 390 nmol/100 μl in acetone)
followed by, a week later, repeated promotion with
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 1.7 nmol/
100 μl in acetone) twice weekly for 20 weeks. Group
III (reference group, n = 10) was topically applied with
a single dose of DMBA followed by repeated 
promotion with TPA twice weekly for 20 weeks (as in group
II). Beginning from the ‘promotion’ period, mice were
given topical application of 10 mg/kg curcumin
(100 μl) 30 min before each TPA application. Groups
IV, V and VI (treatment groups, n = 10/group) were
treated as in group III, with the only difference that
10 mg/kg TQF (group IV), 30 mg/kg TQF (group V)
and 100 mg/kg TQF (group VI), instead of 10 mg/kg 
curcumin, were applied to the mouse skin; whilst groups VII,
VIII and IX (treatment control groups, n = 5/group) 
received only 10 mg/kg TQF (group VII), 30 mg/kg TQF
(group VIII) and 100 mg/kg TQF (group IX) for 20 weeks,
with neither DMBA nor TPA application.
Morphological assessment
Along the experimental period, body weight of mice and
tumor size (length, width and height; measured with a
vernier caliper) were observed and measured at weekly
interval. Only tumors that persisted for more than one
week with diameter greater than 1 mm were taken into
consideration for data analysis. The following parameters
were evaluated: (i) latency period of tumor formation
was determined when the first tumor appeared; (ii) 
percentage of tumor incidence was calculated by dividing
the number of tumor-bearing mice with the total 
number of mice in a group and multiplied with 100 %; (iii)
tumor burden was obtained by dividing the total number
of tumors with the number of tumor-bearing mice in a
group; (iv) tumor volume was measured by multiplying
Π/6 to the length, width and height of tumor.
Sample preparation
At the end of week 20, mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation and sampled for further analysis. Treated
skin area (with or without tumor) and liver were 
harvested. Part of the harvested skin was preserved in 10 %
(v/v) neutral buffered formalin for histopathological 
analysis and in situ cell death detection; whilst, the
remaining was kept in liquid nitrogen for protein 
expression analysis. Harvested liver was cleaned with 
normal saline and stored in liquid nitrogen for biochemical
analysis.
Histopathological analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse skin samples
were processed and stained according to routine 
Haema-toxylin and Eosin (H&E) protocol. Stained slides were
observed under light microscope and digital 
micrographs of the slides were taken.
In situ cell death detection
In situ cell death detection was performed according to
manufacturer’s protocol of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate
(dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL), peroxidase (POD)
assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim,
Germany). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin 
samples were sectioned (4 μm) onto silanized slides which
were deparaffinized, followed by incubation in freshly 
prepared permeabilization solution (0.1 % Triton X-100 in
0.1 % sodium citrate). TUNEL reaction mixture was then
added to the sample. Next, the sample was exposed to
converter-POD, DAB substrate and finally counterstained
with Haematoxylin. TUNEL positive cells (apoptotic cells)
were counted from 10 randomly chosen fields at 400-fold
magnification and expressed as apoptotic index by using
the formula: number of apoptotic cells*100/total number
of counted cells.
Biochemical analysis
Liver samples were prepared as 10 % (w/v) tissue 
homogenate in 0.15 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) [13]. Part of the
homogenate was used for estimation of LPO [14] and
GSH [15]; whilst the remaining homogenate was 
centrifuged at 10,000 g (4 °C) for 15 min and the supernatant
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 4 of 11
was used for determination of SOD [16], CAT [17] and
protein estimation [18]. Triplicate measurements were
made for each liver sample.
Protein expression of transcription factors via 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Monoclonal antibodies for AP-1/total c-Jun, NF-κB/p65
and Nrf2, as well as horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-con-
jugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA). 10 %
skin homogenate was prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4) under ice-cold condition. 100 μl of the sample
supernatant (2 μg protein/ml in carbonate-bicarbonate
buffer, pH 9.6) was loaded in triplicates into a 96-well
ELISA plate and kept overnight at 4 °C. The plate was
then washed and blocked with 300 μl bovine serum 
albumin (5 %, w/v) before incubation for 1 h at 37 °C.
After washing, 100 μl of diluted primary antibody (NF-
κB, c-Jun or Nrf2; 1:1000 in blocking buffer) was added
to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before
addition of 100 μl of diluted secondary antibody (1:1000
in blocking buffer). After another 2 h of incubation at
37 °C, 100 μl 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sul-
fonic acid) (ABTS; 1 mM) substrate containing 1 μl
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 30 %) per ml of ABTS 
solution was added into each well. Color was allowed to 
develop for 20 min in the dark and the plate was read
immediately at 405 nm.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean
(S.E.M.). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
20.0 by using one-way analysis of variance followed by
Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test to
Group: I (vehicle control); II (carcinogen control); III (reference group, 10 mg/kg curcumin); IV (10 mg/kg TQF); V (30 mg/kg TQF); VI (100 mg/kg TQF); VII (treatment
control, 10 mg/kg TQF); VIII (treatment control, 30 mg/kg TQF); IX (treatment control, 100 mg/kg TQF)
compare means between groups. Values with P < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

Low dose triterpene-quinone fraction from
Ardisia crispa root precludes 
chemical-induced mouse skin tumor promotion

Abstract
Background: Drastic increment of skin cancer incidence has driven natural product-based chemoprevention as a
promising approach in anticancer drug development. Apart from its traditional usages against various ailments,
Ardisia crispa (Family: Myrsinaceae) specifically its triterpene-quinone fraction (TQF) which was isolated from the root
hexane extract (ACRH) was recently reported to exert antitumor promoting activity in vitro. This study aimed at
determining chemopreventive effect of TQF against chemically-induced mouse skin tumorigenesis as well as
elucidating its possible pathway(s).
Methods: Mice (n = 10) were initiated with single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) (390 nmol/100 μl)
followed by, a week later, repeated promotion (twice weekly; 20 weeks) with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) (1.7 nmol/100 μl). TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) and curcumin (10 mg/kg; reference) were, respectively, applied
topically to DMBA/TPA-induced mice 30 min before each TPA application. Upon termination, histopathological and
biochemical analysis, as well as Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and
transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were performed to elucidate the
potential mechanism of TQF.
Results: With comparison to the carcinogen control, results revealed that lower dose of TQF (10 mg/kg) conferred
antitumor promoting effect via significant (P < 0.05) suppression against lipid peroxidation (LPO), apoptotic index (cell
death) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), along with reduction of keratinocyte proliferation; whilst its higher dose
(100 mg/kg) was found to promote tumorigenesis by significantly (P < 0.05) increasing LPO and apoptotic index, in
addition to aggravating keratinocyte proliferation.
Conclusions: This study evidenced that TQF, particularly at its lower dosage (10 mg/kg), ameliorated DMBA/TPA-
induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. Though, future investigations are warranted to determine the lowest possible
therapeutic dose of TQF in subsequent in vivo chemopreventive studies.

Background
Skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers
(NMSCs) which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), appears as one of the
most prevalent health concerns worldwide. 
Approximately 2 to 3 million cases of NMSCs and 132,000 cases
of melanoma are reported globally per annum [1]. In
addition to extensive exposure to sunlight and skin
diseases, long term exposure to environmental or 
occupational carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been commonly associated with
skin cancer. In this regard, chemical-induced 
carcinogenesis model serves vital roles in identification of novel
chemopreventive agents which may target either one or
plausibly multiple signaling pathways. An array of 
inter-linking biological changes, including but not limited to
epidermal hyperplasia, inflammation, proliferation and
oxidative stress, are key events implicated in skin tumor
promotion [2].
Ardisia crispa (Family: Myrsinaceae) or locally known
as “hen’s eyes” is an evergreen shrub that has been 
traditionally used as treatment for rheumatism, earache,
cough, fever, as well as for reduction of pain and 
swellings [3-5]. These traditional claims formed the basis
that the plant, specifically Ardisia crispa root hexane
(ACRH) extract, possesses anti-inflammatory, 
anti-hyperalgesia and anti-pyretic effects [6, 7]. In view of the
close association between inflammation and cancer,
ACRH and its isolated quinone-rich fraction was later
proven to exhibit chemopreventive effect against mouse
skin tumorigenesis [8-11]. A triterpene-quinone fraction
(TQF) isolated from ACRH was also recently reported
to exert antitumor promoting activity in vitro, whereby
the effect was attributed to the synergistic action 
between triterpene (isomeric mixture of viminalol; Fig. 1a)
and quinone compounds (2-methoxy-6-undecyl-1,4-
benzoquinone; Fig. 1b) [12].
Considering these, the current in vivo study was 
performed to determine chemopreventive effect of different
dosages (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) of TQF from Ardisia
crispa roots on chemical-induced mouse skin tumor
promotion. Elucidation of possible underlying 
mechanism(s) was focused on several molecular targets 
including apoptosis and biochemical/antioxidant (oxidative
stress) levels [lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced 
glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase
(SOD)] which are under control of nuclear factor-kappa
B (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).

2 cm area about 1 cm off tail, three days before the 
commencement of experiment.
Anti-tumor promoting effects of TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/
kg) in two-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis model
A total of 75 mice were allocated into 9 groups.
Group I (vehicle control, n = 10) received topical 
application of acetone (100 μl) throughout the 
experimental period. Group II (carcinogen control, n = 10)
were given a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]an-
thracene (DMBA; 390 nmol/100 μl in acetone)
followed by, a week later, repeated promotion with
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 1.7 nmol/
100 μl in acetone) twice weekly for 20 weeks. Group
III (reference group, n = 10) was topically applied with
a single dose of DMBA followed by repeated 
promotion with TPA twice weekly for 20 weeks (as in group
II). Beginning from the ‘promotion’ period, mice were
given topical application of 10 mg/kg curcumin
(100 μl) 30 min before each TPA application. Groups
IV, V and VI (treatment groups, n = 10/group) were
treated as in group III, with the only difference that
10 mg/kg TQF (group IV), 30 mg/kg TQF (group V)
and 100 mg/kg TQF (group VI), instead of 10 mg/kg 
curcumin, were applied to the mouse skin; whilst groups VII,
VIII and IX (treatment control groups, n = 5/group) 
received only 10 mg/kg TQF (group VII), 30 mg/kg TQF
(group VIII) and 100 mg/kg TQF (group IX) for 20 weeks,
with neither DMBA nor TPA application.
Morphological assessment
Along the experimental period, body weight of mice and
tumor size (length, width and height; measured with a
vernier caliper) were observed and measured at weekly
interval. Only tumors that persisted for more than one
week with diameter greater than 1 mm were taken into
consideration for data analysis. The following parameters
were evaluated: (i) latency period of tumor formation
was determined when the first tumor appeared; (ii) 
percentage of tumor incidence was calculated by dividing
the number of tumor-bearing mice with the total 
number of mice in a group and multiplied with 100 %; (iii)
tumor burden was obtained by dividing the total number
of tumors with the number of tumor-bearing mice in a
group; (iv) tumor volume was measured by multiplying
Π/6 to the length, width and height of tumor.
Sample preparation
At the end of week 20, mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation and sampled for further analysis. Treated
skin area (with or without tumor) and liver were 
harvested. Part of the harvested skin was preserved in 10 %
(v/v) neutral buffered formalin for histopathological 
analysis and in situ cell death detection; whilst, the
remaining was kept in liquid nitrogen for protein 
expression analysis. Harvested liver was cleaned with 
normal saline and stored in liquid nitrogen for biochemical
analysis.
Histopathological analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse skin samples
were processed and stained according to routine 
Haema-toxylin and Eosin (H&E) protocol. Stained slides were
observed under light microscope and digital 
micrographs of the slides were taken.
In situ cell death detection
In situ cell death detection was performed according to
manufacturer’s protocol of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate
(dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL), peroxidase (POD)
assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim,
Germany). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin 
samples were sectioned (4 μm) onto silanized slides which
were deparaffinized, followed by incubation in freshly 
prepared permeabilization solution (0.1 % Triton X-100 in
0.1 % sodium citrate). TUNEL reaction mixture was then
added to the sample. Next, the sample was exposed to
converter-POD, DAB substrate and finally counterstained
with Haematoxylin. TUNEL positive cells (apoptotic cells)
were counted from 10 randomly chosen fields at 400-fold
magnification and expressed as apoptotic index by using
the formula: number of apoptotic cells*100/total number
of counted cells.
Biochemical analysis
Liver samples were prepared as 10 % (w/v) tissue 
homogenate in 0.15 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) [13]. Part of the
homogenate was used for estimation of LPO [14] and
GSH [15]; whilst the remaining homogenate was 
centrifuged at 10,000 g (4 °C) for 15 min and the supernatant
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 4 of 11
was used for determination of SOD [16], CAT [17] and
protein estimation [18]. Triplicate measurements were
made for each liver sample.
Protein expression of transcription factors via 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Monoclonal antibodies for AP-1/total c-Jun, NF-κB/p65
and Nrf2, as well as horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-con-
jugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA). 10 %
skin homogenate was prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4) under ice-cold condition. 100 μl of the sample
supernatant (2 μg protein/ml in carbonate-bicarbonate
buffer, pH 9.6) was loaded in triplicates into a 96-well
ELISA plate and kept overnight at 4 °C. The plate was
then washed and blocked with 300 μl bovine serum 
albumin (5 %, w/v) before incubation for 1 h at 37 °C.
After washing, 100 μl of diluted primary antibody (NF-
κB, c-Jun or Nrf2; 1:1000 in blocking buffer) was added
to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before
addition of 100 μl of diluted secondary antibody (1:1000
in blocking buffer). After another 2 h of incubation at
37 °C, 100 μl 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sul-
fonic acid) (ABTS; 1 mM) substrate containing 1 μl
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 30 %) per ml of ABTS 
solution was added into each well. Color was allowed to 
develop for 20 min in the dark and the plate was read
immediately at 405 nm.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean
(S.E.M.). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
20.0 by using one-way analysis of variance followed by
Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test to
Group: I (vehicle control); II (carcinogen control); III (reference group, 10 mg/kg curcumin); IV (10 mg/kg TQF); V (30 mg/kg TQF); VI (100 mg/kg TQF); VII (treatment
control, 10 mg/kg TQF); VIII (treatment control, 30 mg/kg TQF); IX (treatment control, 100 mg/kg TQF)
compare means between groups. Values with P < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Antitumor promoting effects of TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/
kg) in two-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis model
Protective effect of topical application of TQF (10, 30
and 100 mg/kg) in DMBA/TPA-induced mouse skin
tumors during the ‘promotion’ stage was evaluated
and the findings were summarized in Table 1. It is
prominent that topical application of TQF for
20 weeks in mice did not result in remarkable 
difference in body weight among all groups. There was
also an absence of observable tumor development in
group I (vehicle control) and groups VII-IX (treat-
ment control). Though, mice in the carcinogen 
control group (group II) exhibited tumor development
beginning from week 9 (data not shown). A 
distinguishing delay in tumor formation was noted in mice
treated with 30 mg/kg TQF (group V, week 11) and
10 mg/kg TQF (group IV, week 14). Surprisingly,
increasing TQF dosage seems to promote tumor 
development in which tumor was documented as early
as week 6 in mice treated with 100 mg/kg TQF
(group VI).
We also observed that, at the end of the study, group
IV (33.3 %) exhibited significantly lower (P < 0.05) 
percentage of tumor incidence than group II (60 %); whilst
the values escalated in mice treated with higher dosages
of TQF, accounting for 77.8 % and 100 % tumor 
incidence in groups V and VI, respectively. As the reference
compound, curcumin-treated group (group III) showed
only 25 % tumor incidence. Group IV (1.00 ± 0.00) also
showed significantly lower (P < 0.05) tumor burden than
group II (2.00 ± 0.37) and group III (1.50 ± 0.50); whilst
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 5 of 11
its tumor volume (1.48 ± 0.37 mm3) was comparable to
that of group III (4.59 ± 3.58 mm3), but at significantly
lower value (P < 0.05) than group II (7.62 ± 3.51 mm3).
Histopathological analysis
Microscopic examination of treated skin, with or 
without tumor formation, after 20 weeks of promotion
period showed presence of hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis
and/or parakeratosis, except for group I (Fig. 2). Tumors
formed showed papillomatous growth of benign 
characteristic with well-bordered basement membrane and no
evidence of invasion to indicate malignant changes. As
carcinogen control, group II showed hyperplastic 
epidermal layer along with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and
mild increment in the number of keratin pearls. Group
III, though, exhibited only mild epidermal hyperplasia.
Among TQF-treatment groups (groups IV-VI), the least
hyperplastic epidermal layer was observed in group IV,
followed by groups V and VI. Hyperkeratosis and 
para-keratosis were also observed in group VI; whilst group V
displayed only mild hyperkeratosis and group IV showed
an absence of both features. Increased formation of
keratin pearls was also noted in both groups V and VI.
Mild hyperplasia were observed in all treatment control
groups (groups VII-IX), in addition to mild 
hyperkeratosis and mild increment in the amount of keratin pearls
in group VIII, as well as mild hyperkeratosis, 
parakerato-sis and severe increment in the number of keratin pearls
in group IX.
In situ cell death detection
Apoptotic effect of TQF on mouse skin tumor 
promotion was determined by using TUNEL assay, as depicted
in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b (representative micrographs). Upon
stimulation by carcinogens, we noticed an increase in
apoptotic index in group II (9.19 ± 0.76 %) in 
comparison to group I (5.39 ± 0.40 %). Conversely, group III
(6.72 ± 0.80 %) showed significantly reduced apoptotic
index (P < 0.05), whereas an approximate reduction of
1.6- and 1.3-fold were observed in group IV (5.92 ±
0.69 %) and group V (7.11 ± 0.55 %) respectively, with
respect to group II. Yet, an inconsequential to group II
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 6 of 11
apoptotic index was noted in group VI (8.26 ± 0.39 %). It
was also interesting to note that treatment with TQF
alone, without DMBA/TPA induction, increased 
apoptosis dose-dependently. Such findings infer a dual role of
TQF in modulating apoptotic effect in which lower
doses of TQF (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) provided 
safeguard against DMBA/TPA-induced apoptosis; whereas
higher dose of TQF (100 mg/kg) was found to potently
(i)                             (ii)                                 (iii)
(iv)          (v)                                       (vi)
(vii)                                  (viii)                                (ix)
mediate DNA damage, even though in the absence of
carcinogens.
Biochemical analysis
In comparison to the carcinogen control [group II, 1.82
± 0.09 nmol malondialdehyde (MDA)/g tissue; Table 2],
we found that topical application of 10 mg/kg TQF
(group IV, 1.37 ± 0.16 nmol MDA/g tissue) significantly
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 7 of 11
reduced (P < 0.05) MDA production to a level that was
comparable to that of group III (1.30 ± 0.23 nmol MDA/
g tissue). Though, prominent deterioration of LPO was
demonstrated by mice in group VI (2.26 ± 0.19 nmol
MDA/g tissue). A similar trend was also observed in the
treatment control groups (groups VII-IX).
On the other hand, considerable depletion of GSH was
noted in group II (0.61 ± 0.06 μg/mg liver tissue), in 
relative to group I (0.84 ± 0.05 μg/mg liver tissue). 
Pretreatment with TQF on DMBA/TPA-induced mice restored
the depletion in dose-dependent manner, reporting 0.77,
0.89 and 0.95 μg/mg liver tissue for groups IV, V and VI
respectively, with insignificant difference among the
groups. Such protective effect by TQF was comparable to
those exerted by curcumin (group III, 0.95 ± 0.07 μg/mg
liver tissue). Though, treatment with TQF alone seems to
exert toxicity in mice wherein depleting GSH activities
were observed with parallel increment of TQF dosages.
Yet, astonishingly, high level of CAT was found in group
II (2.33 ± 0.14 U/μg protein). This could be an adaptive 
response of the mice to increasing oxidative stress induced
by DMBA/TPA application. The adaptive response was
apparently reduced with topical application of TQF
(groups IV-IX) and curcumin (group III), as indicated by
significant reduction of CAT activity (P < 0.05) in these
groups. We also observed an overall absence of significant
difference between groups in SOD activity which is 
indicative of an inconsequential protective role of such enzyme
in mediating antitumor promoting activity of TQF.
Protein expression of transcription factor via ELISA
Our results (Fig. 4) on the possible involvement of 
transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-1/c-jun, Nrf2) in mediating
antitumor promoting effect of TQF showed that TQF
inhibited tumor promotion in mouse skin by suppressing
NF-κB. This was indicated by marked reduction of 
ab-sorbance in NF-κB level in groups IV-IX in comparison to
group II (0.132 ± 0.003). The most noteworthy reduction
of NF-κB expression was seen in group V (0.103 ± 0.003),
at comparable level to that of group III (0.099 ± 0.004). As
a transcription factor that mainly governs cellular 
proliferation, AP-1/c-Jun protein expression was augmented in
group II (0.129 ± 0.008). The expression was also raised
with topical application of TQF (groups IV-VI) and 
curcumin (group III) at insignificant difference with respect to
group II. Such findings imply the restricted impact of
those treatments on AP-1 protein, viz. the treatments
caused neither further proliferation nor inhibition towards
mouse skin tumors development. On the other hand,
there was an overall insignificant difference of Nrf2 
protein expression level between groups. Though the 
difference is not statistically significant, decreased expressions
were noted in group II (0.108 ± 0.003) and group VI
(0.109 ± 0.007) when compared to group I (0.117 ± 0.010).
In comparison to group II, the Nrf2 protein level was 
increased upon treatment with 30 mg/kg TQF (group V,
0.128 ± 0.019) and was further augmented when 10 mg/kg
TQF (group IV, 0.150 ± 0.010) was applied to DMBA/
TPA-induced mice, thus suggesting a promising role of
TQF in up regulating Nrf2 expression at low dosages.
Discussion
Chemoprevention employs naturally occurring or 
synthetic chemical agents to block, suppress or reverse 
carcinogenesis at an early stage before invasion or
metastasis occur [19, 20]. In comparison to the initiation
stage which is an irreversible event, the promotion stage
occurs over an extended period of time that may be 
reversible during the course of tumor development [21]
Thus, prevention of tumor promotion is customarily
regarded as a more efficient approach in cancer 
chemoprevention. In recent years, research has shifted towards
developing novel chemopreventive agent from natural
products, especially plants. For they represent a vast
vault of phytochemicals with diverse medicinal usages
that have been exploited since the ancient times, as seen
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 8 of 11
in traditional medicines such as Ayurveda (India) and
Acupuncture (China).
Years of inflammatory-related research have led to 
surprising discovery that Ardisia cirspa indeed possesses
potential antitumor property, despite a lack of 
understanding on the possible mechanism(s) involved [8-11].
In our present effort to explore, for the very first time,
the mechanism(s) underlying antitumor property of
Ardisia crispa, focus has been put on exploring its effect
of cellular apoptosis, biochemical/antioxidant markers
(oxidative stress) levels and the associated transcription
factors (NF-κB, AP-1 and Nrf2). Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are highly indicative as one of many causative 
factors in tumour promotion whereas antioxidants such as
GSH, SOD and CAT are indispensable for protection
against the deteriorating effects.
In response to repetitive treatment with carcinogen, 
sustained epidermal hyperplasia or cell proliferation occurs
preceded by inflammation and followed by formation of
papillomas that may eventually lead to SCC [21, 22].
Though, a large proportion of tumors formed over a
period of 20 weeks are merely papillomas that rarely 
progress into SCC [22, 23]. Shishodia et al. documented that
activation of NF-κB upon DMBA/TPA stimulation is
closely associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation
[24]. From our study, we found that TQF suppressed
tumor promotion at lower dosage (10 mg/kg) but 
potentiated tumor formation with increasing dosages (30 mg/kg
and 100 mg/kg) in DMBA/TPA-induced mice. We 
postulate that 10 mg/kg TQF modulated cellular proliferation
in similar manner as curcumin did by causing profound
inhibition against NF-κB-regulated cyclin D1, as 
evidenced by their significant suppression on NF-κB (Fig. 4)
[24]. Nevertheless, study has also reported that tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
may interact with either TRAF for NF-κB (TANK) or
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK1).
Thus, instead of interacting with TANK, we further 
postulate that higher dosage of TQF could have interact with
the latter (MEKK1) and caused activation of AP-1, as well
as subsequent cell proliferation [25].
We also investigated on the effect of TQF on cellular
apoptosis. Application of tumor promoter has been 
reported to augment cellular ROS levels and cause 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand breaks, which
may ultimately lead to apoptosis if cells suffer from 
extensive DNA damage [26-28]. In this regard, increased
apoptotic index (Fig. 3a) upon application of DMBA/
TPA in the current study is strongly believed to arise
from carcinogen-induced oxidative stress, as exemplified
by a significant increase in LPO level (Table 2). 
Intervention with curcumin caused noticeable protective role
against DNA damage-induced apoptosis by reducing
oxidative stress (significant diminution of LPO and up
regulation of GSH), as previously reported [29]. These
effects were mediated via down regulation of 
oxidant-generating genes such as NF-κB [30]. Considering that,
it is reasonable to deduce that 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg
TQF mediated protection against apoptosis via similar
manner. i.e reduction of oxidative stress (lowered LPO
and increased GSH) (Table 2) and suppression of NF-κB
(Fig. 4).
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 9 of 11
On the contrary, increasing TQF dosage (100 mg/kg)
seems to confer toxic effects attributable to the 
increasing amount of quinone compound present. Aside from
its vital biological function, as in endogenous 
biomole-cules such as phylloquinone (vitamin K) and ubiquinone
(coenzyme Q10), quinone is generally cytotoxic and/or
genotoxic. Quinones are Michael acceptors that are
capable of alkylating effectively at nucleophilic sites on
macromolecules such as DNA or proteins. They are also
found to react spontaneously with GSH to produce 
GS-hydroquinones that are readily autoxidized to form
semiquinones, superoxide anion (O2•−) and H2O2 [31].
This reaction not only depletes cellular GSH levels, but
also leads to increased production of ROS which are
both devastating factors to cells. Alternatively, quinones
are redox active compounds that are prone to reductive
activation. An electron is transferred from reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-
cytochrome P450 reductase to quinone, leading to 
production of semiquinone which are readily oxidized back
to the parent quinone, in the presence of oxygen, via 
reduction of oxygen to O2•− [32]. This redox cycling leads
to massive production of O2•− and eventual generation of
oxidative stress condition.
LPO is a renowned marker of oxidative stress as it is
known to increase production of epoxides, 
hydroperox-ides, and MDA that may interact with protein and DNA,
thus leading to tumor formation. Ursolic acid, a type of
triterpene compound that shows close structural 
resemblance to the triterpene compounds (amyrins) under
study, was evidenced to protect human lymphocytes
against ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced oxidative stress
through its significant reductive effect on LPO [33]. This
suggests that the presence of amyrins in TQF may, at
least in part, confer similar protective effect. Meanwhile,
antioxidants, both non-enzymatic (GSH) and enzymatic
(SOD and CAT), are reputable for protection against
oxidative stress. Our findings indicate that pretreatment
with curcumin and TQF not only restored the depleted
GSH levels (Table 2), but might have also induced GSH
synthesis. This is supported by Dickinson et al. and
Biswas et al. who reported that curcumin was capable of
increasing expression of both catalytic and modifier 
subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) that are needed
for GSH biosynthesis [34, 35] Whilst, reduction of GSH
level in mice treated with TQF alone (without DMBA/
TPA application) as a result of TQF-induced 
pro-oxidant environment that causes oxidation of GSH to
glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is highly indicative [36].
Although diminished levels of antioxidants are 
frequently implicated under oxidative stress condition, 
exceptions to the widely accepted statement have been
previously reported. Rats exposed to acute intoxication
with chlorfenvinphos were reported to significantly
increase hepatic CAT activity, as compared to the control
(untreated) group. It was explicated that the increased
CAT level was due to response of the liver to high levels
of H2O2 [37]. Such an increased CAT activity is in 
agreement with the current findings in DMBA/TPA-induced
mice (Table 2). Nonetheless, it is supremely important to
note that elimination of H2O2 does not occur solely via
CATactivity, for GPx also possesses essential role in 
exerting similar effect. Both GPx and CAT are known to act
under different conditions of H2O2 wherein low 
concentration of H2O2 is principally acted upon by GPx whereas
CAT is indispensable when GPx reaches saturation in the
presence of high amount of H2O2 [38]. In this regard, 
curcumin and TQF (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) are postulated
to cause greater inhibition against H2O2 production than
that in the vehicle control along with prominent up 
regulation of GPx expression to an extent that prevailed the
amount of H2O2. This is parallel to previous findings by
Sevgiler et al. whom reported that curcumin increased
GPx levels while concomitantly lowered CAT activity in
response to cadmium-induced oxidative stress [39]. 
Moreover, neither application of DMBA/TPA, curcumin nor
TQF in the current study resulted in significant change in
SOD levels as compared to the vehicle control. Similar
findings have been reported by Guangwei et al. who found
insignificant change in SOD levels in rats intoxicated with
acrylonitrile and those pretreated with curcumin [40].
Transcription factors, particularly NF-κB, AP-1 and
Nrf2, are signaling molecules with vital roles in 
mediating inflammatory response, cellular proliferation and 
either antioxidative or detoxification systems. From our
analyses, it is ubiquitous that application of DMBA/TPA
on mouse skin resulted in activation of NF-κB, as 
similarly reported previously [41]. As a transcription factor
that plays major role in inflammation, down regulation
of NF-κB conferred by curcumin or TQF as a 
consequence of their anti-inflammatory action is highly 
suggestive. Indeed, curcumin was shown to down regulate
NF-κB via inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα 
degradation, p65 phosphorylation and p65 nuclear 
trans-location which subsequently correlated with down
regulation of downstream cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2)
expression [42] Likewise, TQF which contains COX-2
inhibitor (quinone compound) is also supposed to act
through similar mechanism of NF-κB suppression [43].
Such postulation is based on the presence of a functional
group (phenyl methoxy group) common to both agents.
Curcumin possesses two phenyl methoxy groups
(-OCH3) in its chemical structure and it was found to
confer the most active suppressive effect against NF-κB
activation. The extent of inhibition diminished when 
de-methoxycurcumin (one phenyl methoxy group) was
applied and the least suppression was exhibited by 
bisde-methoxycurcumin (no phenyl methoxy group). These
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 10 of 11
findings infer the importance of phenyl methoxy moiety,
which is essentially present in the quinone compound
(Fig. 1b) of TQF, at suppressing NF-κB activation albeit
a lack of understanding in the reaction(s) involved [44].
Although simultaneous inhibition of AP-1/c-Jun along
with down regulation of NF-κB is commonly exhibited
by chemopreventive agents including curcumin, this is
not always the case. Dickinson et al. reported that the
total c-Jun content (phosphor- and non-phosphorylated)
did not change significantly upon exposure to curcumin,
but a dramatic two-fold increase in phosphorylated (acti-
vated) c-Jun was noted [34]. As revealed by Sabapathy et
al., different c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) isoforms
act antagonistically in mediating c-Jun expression. JNK1
is more efficient in phosphorylating c-Jun whilst JNK2
appears to target c-Jun for degradation [45]. Under such
circumstances, curcumin and TQF are postulated to
stimulate activation of both JNKs isoforms, leading to an
increased c-Jun phosphorylation along with concomitant
depletion of c-Jun protein and thus, resulted in 
insignifi-cantly modulated total c-Jun content (Fig. 4).
Nrf2 is another transcription factor that is inevitably
needed in preventing oncogenic response via regulation
of antioxidants or detoxifying genes. Down regulation of
endogenous Nrf2 expression has been implicated upon
DMBA/TPA treatment in mice skin [46]. Curcumin, as
well as triterpenoid and quinone compounds, contains
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety that is capable of
interacting with thiol group (-SH) in Kelch-like 
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) via Michael addition 
reaction [47-49]. This dissociates Nrf2 from Keap1-Nrf2
complex, saving it from ubiquitin-target degradation and
thus, increases its level. Whilst low concentration of
Michael acceptor binds preferentially to Keap1, high
concentration of the agent was found to target and 
inhibit proteins with lower binding affinity [50]. Under
such condition, Nrf2-Keap1 complex remains 
uninterrupted and Nrf2 is destabilized through rapid 
degradation which resulted in its reduced detectable levels, as
exhibited by mice treated with 100 mg/kg TQF (Fig. 4).
Conclusions
Compiling findings from the present study, it is 
noteworthy that in vivo antitumor promoting activity of TQF
was restricted by dosage whereby lower dose of TQF
(10 mg/kg) suppressed DMBA/TPA-induced mice skin
papilloma; whilst higher dose of TQF (100 mg/kg) was
found to potentiate tumor development. This was 
further reinforced by mechanism studies in which the lower
dose (10 mg/kg) was shown to confer antitumor 
promoting effect via significant (P < 0.05) suppression
against LPO, apoptotic index (DNA damage) and 
NF-κB, along with reduction of keratinocyte proliferation.
Based on these results, it is suggested that TQF be
examined at much lower doses in subsequent in vivo
tumorigenesis study until the lowest possible therapeutic
dose is attained.

Abstract
Background: Drastic increment of skin cancer incidence has driven natural product-based chemoprevention as a
promising approach in anticancer drug development. Apart from its traditional usages against various ailments,
Ardisia crispa (Family: Myrsinaceae) specifically its triterpene-quinone fraction (TQF) which was isolated from the root
hexane extract (ACRH) was recently reported to exert antitumor promoting activity in vitro. This study aimed at
determining chemopreventive effect of TQF against chemically-induced mouse skin tumorigenesis as well as
elucidating its possible pathway(s).
Methods: Mice (n = 10) were initiated with single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) (390 nmol/100 μl)
followed by, a week later, repeated promotion (twice weekly; 20 weeks) with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) (1.7 nmol/100 μl). TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) and curcumin (10 mg/kg; reference) were, respectively, applied
topically to DMBA/TPA-induced mice 30 min before each TPA application. Upon termination, histopathological and
biochemical analysis, as well as Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and
transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were performed to elucidate the
potential mechanism of TQF.
Results: With comparison to the carcinogen control, results revealed that lower dose of TQF (10 mg/kg) conferred
antitumor promoting effect via significant (P < 0.05) suppression against lipid peroxidation (LPO), apoptotic index (cell
death) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), along with reduction of keratinocyte proliferation; whilst its higher dose
(100 mg/kg) was found to promote tumorigenesis by significantly (P < 0.05) increasing LPO and apoptotic index, in
addition to aggravating keratinocyte proliferation.
Conclusions: This study evidenced that TQF, particularly at its lower dosage (10 mg/kg), ameliorated DMBA/TPA-
induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. Though, future investigations are warranted to determine the lowest possible
therapeutic dose of TQF in subsequent in vivo chemopreventive studies.

Background
Skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers
(NMSCs) which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), appears as one of the
most prevalent health concerns worldwide. 
Approximately 2 to 3 million cases of NMSCs and 132,000 cases
of melanoma are reported globally per annum [1]. In
addition to extensive exposure to sunlight and skin
diseases, long term exposure to environmental or 
occupational carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been commonly associated with
skin cancer. In this regard, chemical-induced 
carcinogenesis model serves vital roles in identification of novel
chemopreventive agents which may target either one or
plausibly multiple signaling pathways. An array of 
inter-linking biological changes, including but not limited to
epidermal hyperplasia, inflammation, proliferation and
oxidative stress, are key events implicated in skin tumor
promotion [2].
Ardisia crispa (Family: Myrsinaceae) or locally known
as “hen’s eyes” is an evergreen shrub that has been 
traditionally used as treatment for rheumatism, earache,
cough, fever, as well as for reduction of pain and 
swellings [3-5]. These traditional claims formed the basis
that the plant, specifically Ardisia crispa root hexane
(ACRH) extract, possesses anti-inflammatory, 
anti-hyperalgesia and anti-pyretic effects [6, 7]. In view of the
close association between inflammation and cancer,
ACRH and its isolated quinone-rich fraction was later
proven to exhibit chemopreventive effect against mouse
skin tumorigenesis [8-11]. A triterpene-quinone fraction
(TQF) isolated from ACRH was also recently reported
to exert antitumor promoting activity in vitro, whereby
the effect was attributed to the synergistic action 
between triterpene (isomeric mixture of viminalol; Fig. 1a)
and quinone compounds (2-methoxy-6-undecyl-1,4-
benzoquinone; Fig. 1b) [12].
Considering these, the current in vivo study was 
performed to determine chemopreventive effect of different
dosages (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) of TQF from Ardisia
crispa roots on chemical-induced mouse skin tumor
promotion. Elucidation of possible underlying 
mechanism(s) was focused on several molecular targets 
including apoptosis and biochemical/antioxidant (oxidative
stress) levels [lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced 
glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase
(SOD)] which are under control of nuclear factor-kappa
B (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
Chemoprevention employs naturally occurring or 
synthetic chemical agents to block, suppress or reverse 
carcinogenesis at an early stage before invasion or
metastasis occur [19, 20]. In comparison to the initiation
stage which is an irreversible event, the promotion stage
occurs over an extended period of time that may be 
reversible during the course of tumor development [21]
Thus, prevention of tumor promotion is customarily
regarded as a more efficient approach in cancer 
chemoprevention. In recent years, research has shifted towards
developing novel chemopreventive agent from natural
products, especially plants. For they represent a vast
vault of phytochemicals with diverse medicinal usages
that have been exploited since the ancient times, as seen
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 8 of 11
in traditional medicines such as Ayurveda (India) and
Acupuncture (China).
Years of inflammatory-related research have led to 
surprising discovery that Ardisia cirspa indeed possesses
potential antitumor property, despite a lack of 
understanding on the possible mechanism(s) involved [8-11].
In our present effort to explore, for the very first time,
the mechanism(s) underlying antitumor property of
Ardisia crispa, focus has been put on exploring its effect
of cellular apoptosis, biochemical/antioxidant markers
(oxidative stress) levels and the associated transcription
factors (NF-κB, AP-1 and Nrf2). Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are highly indicative as one of many causative 
factors in tumour promotion whereas antioxidants such as
GSH, SOD and CAT are indispensable for protection
against the deteriorating effects.
In response to repetitive treatment with carcinogen, 
sustained epidermal hyperplasia or cell proliferation occurs
preceded by inflammation and followed by formation of
papillomas that may eventually lead to SCC [21, 22].
Though, a large proportion of tumors formed over a
period of 20 weeks are merely papillomas that rarely 
progress into SCC [22, 23]. Shishodia et al. documented that
activation of NF-κB upon DMBA/TPA stimulation is
closely associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation
[24]. From our study, we found that TQF suppressed
tumor promotion at lower dosage (10 mg/kg) but 
potentiated tumor formation with increasing dosages (30 mg/kg
and 100 mg/kg) in DMBA/TPA-induced mice. We 
postulate that 10 mg/kg TQF modulated cellular proliferation
in similar manner as curcumin did by causing profound
inhibition against NF-κB-regulated cyclin D1, as 
evidenced by their significant suppression on NF-κB (Fig. 4)
[24]. Nevertheless, study has also reported that tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
may interact with either TRAF for NF-κB (TANK) or
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK1).
Thus, instead of interacting with TANK, we further 
postulate that higher dosage of TQF could have interact with
the latter (MEKK1) and caused activation of AP-1, as well
as subsequent cell proliferation [25].
We also investigated on the effect of TQF on cellular
apoptosis. Application of tumor promoter has been 
reported to augment cellular ROS levels and cause 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand breaks, which
may ultimately lead to apoptosis if cells suffer from 
extensive DNA damage [26-28]. In this regard, increased
apoptotic index (Fig. 3a) upon application of DMBA/
TPA in the current study is strongly believed to arise
from carcinogen-induced oxidative stress, as exemplified
by a significant increase in LPO level (Table 2). 
Intervention with curcumin caused noticeable protective role
against DNA damage-induced apoptosis by reducing
oxidative stress (significant diminution of LPO and up
regulation of GSH), as previously reported [29]. These
effects were mediated via down regulation of 
oxidant-generating genes such as NF-κB [30]. Considering that,
it is reasonable to deduce that 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg
TQF mediated protection against apoptosis via similar
manner. i.e reduction of oxidative stress (lowered LPO
and increased GSH) (Table 2) and suppression of NF-κB
(Fig. 4).
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 9 of 11
On the contrary, increasing TQF dosage (100 mg/kg)
seems to confer toxic effects attributable to the 
increasing amount of quinone compound present. Aside from
its vital biological function, as in endogenous 
biomole-cules such as phylloquinone (vitamin K) and ubiquinone
(coenzyme Q10), quinone is generally cytotoxic and/or
genotoxic. Quinones are Michael acceptors that are
capable of alkylating effectively at nucleophilic sites on
macromolecules such as DNA or proteins. They are also
found to react spontaneously with GSH to produce 
GS-hydroquinones that are readily autoxidized to form
semiquinones, superoxide anion (O2•−) and H2O2 [31].
This reaction not only depletes cellular GSH levels, but
also leads to increased production of ROS which are
both devastating factors to cells. Alternatively, quinones
are redox active compounds that are prone to reductive
activation. An electron is transferred from reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-
cytochrome P450 reductase to quinone, leading to 
production of semiquinone which are readily oxidized back
to the parent quinone, in the presence of oxygen, via 
reduction of oxygen to O2•− [32]. This redox cycling leads
to massive production of O2•− and eventual generation of
oxidative stress condition.
LPO is a renowned marker of oxidative stress as it is
known to increase production of epoxides, 
hydroperox-ides, and MDA that may interact with protein and DNA,
thus leading to tumor formation. Ursolic acid, a type of
triterpene compound that shows close structural 
resemblance to the triterpene compounds (amyrins) under
study, was evidenced to protect human lymphocytes
against ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced oxidative stress
through its significant reductive effect on LPO [33]. This
suggests that the presence of amyrins in TQF may, at
least in part, confer similar protective effect. Meanwhile,
antioxidants, both non-enzymatic (GSH) and enzymatic
(SOD and CAT), are reputable for protection against
oxidative stress. Our findings indicate that pretreatment
with curcumin and TQF not only restored the depleted
GSH levels (Table 2), but might have also induced GSH
synthesis. This is supported by Dickinson et al. and
Biswas et al. who reported that curcumin was capable of
increasing expression of both catalytic and modifier 
subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) that are needed
for GSH biosynthesis [34, 35] Whilst, reduction of GSH
level in mice treated with TQF alone (without DMBA/
TPA application) as a result of TQF-induced 
pro-oxidant environment that causes oxidation of GSH to
glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is highly indicative [36].
Although diminished levels of antioxidants are 
frequently implicated under oxidative stress condition, 
exceptions to the widely accepted statement have been
previously reported. Rats exposed to acute intoxication
with chlorfenvinphos were reported to significantly
increase hepatic CAT activity, as compared to the control
(untreated) group. It was explicated that the increased
CAT level was due to response of the liver to high levels
of H2O2 [37]. Such an increased CAT activity is in 
agreement with the current findings in DMBA/TPA-induced
mice (Table 2). Nonetheless, it is supremely important to
note that elimination of H2O2 does not occur solely via
CATactivity, for GPx also possesses essential role in 
exerting similar effect. Both GPx and CAT are known to act
under different conditions of H2O2 wherein low 
concentration of H2O2 is principally acted upon by GPx whereas
CAT is indispensable when GPx reaches saturation in the
presence of high amount of H2O2 [38]. In this regard, 
curcumin and TQF (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) are postulated
to cause greater inhibition against H2O2 production than
that in the vehicle control along with prominent up 
regulation of GPx expression to an extent that prevailed the
amount of H2O2. This is parallel to previous findings by
Sevgiler et al. whom reported that curcumin increased
GPx levels while concomitantly lowered CAT activity in
response to cadmium-induced oxidative stress [39]. 
Moreover, neither application of DMBA/TPA, curcumin nor
TQF in the current study resulted in significant change in
SOD levels as compared to the vehicle control. Similar
findings have been reported by Guangwei et al. who found
insignificant change in SOD levels in rats intoxicated with
acrylonitrile and those pretreated with curcumin [40].
Transcription factors, particularly NF-κB, AP-1 and
Nrf2, are signaling molecules with vital roles in 
mediating inflammatory response, cellular proliferation and 
either antioxidative or detoxification systems. From our
analyses, it is ubiquitous that application of DMBA/TPA
on mouse skin resulted in activation of NF-κB, as 
similarly reported previously [41]. As a transcription factor
that plays major role in inflammation, down regulation
of NF-κB conferred by curcumin or TQF as a 
consequence of their anti-inflammatory action is highly 
suggestive. Indeed, curcumin was shown to down regulate
NF-κB via inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα 
degradation, p65 phosphorylation and p65 nuclear 
trans-location which subsequently correlated with down
regulation of downstream cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2)
expression [42] Likewise, TQF which contains COX-2
inhibitor (quinone compound) is also supposed to act
through similar mechanism of NF-κB suppression [43].
Such postulation is based on the presence of a functional
group (phenyl methoxy group) common to both agents.
Curcumin possesses two phenyl methoxy groups
(-OCH3) in its chemical structure and it was found to
confer the most active suppressive effect against NF-κB
activation. The extent of inhibition diminished when 
de-methoxycurcumin (one phenyl methoxy group) was
applied and the least suppression was exhibited by 
bisde-methoxycurcumin (no phenyl methoxy group). These
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 10 of 11
findings infer the importance of phenyl methoxy moiety,
which is essentially present in the quinone compound
(Fig. 1b) of TQF, at suppressing NF-κB activation albeit
a lack of understanding in the reaction(s) involved [44].
Although simultaneous inhibition of AP-1/c-Jun along
with down regulation of NF-κB is commonly exhibited
by chemopreventive agents including curcumin, this is
not always the case. Dickinson et al. reported that the
total c-Jun content (phosphor- and non-phosphorylated)
did not change significantly upon exposure to curcumin,
but a dramatic two-fold increase in phosphorylated (acti-
vated) c-Jun was noted [34]. As revealed by Sabapathy et
al., different c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) isoforms
act antagonistically in mediating c-Jun expression. JNK1
is more efficient in phosphorylating c-Jun whilst JNK2
appears to target c-Jun for degradation [45]. Under such
circumstances, curcumin and TQF are postulated to
stimulate activation of both JNKs isoforms, leading to an
increased c-Jun phosphorylation along with concomitant
depletion of c-Jun protein and thus, resulted in 
insignifi-cantly modulated total c-Jun content (Fig. 4).
Nrf2 is another transcription factor that is inevitably
needed in preventing oncogenic response via regulation
of antioxidants or detoxifying genes. Down regulation of
endogenous Nrf2 expression has been implicated upon
DMBA/TPA treatment in mice skin [46]. Curcumin, as
well as triterpenoid and quinone compounds, contains
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety that is capable of
interacting with thiol group (-SH) in Kelch-like 
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) via Michael addition 
reaction [47-49]. This dissociates Nrf2 from Keap1-Nrf2
complex, saving it from ubiquitin-target degradation and
thus, increases its level. Whilst low concentration of
Michael acceptor binds preferentially to Keap1, high
concentration of the agent was found to target and 
inhibit proteins with lower binding affinity [50]. Under
such condition, Nrf2-Keap1 complex remains 
uninterrupted and Nrf2 is destabilized through rapid 
degradation which resulted in its reduced detectable levels, as
exhibited by mice treated with 100 mg/kg TQF (Fig. 4).

Results
Antitumor promoting effects of TQF (10, 30 and 100 mg/
kg) in two-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis model
Protective effect of topical application of TQF (10, 30
and 100 mg/kg) in DMBA/TPA-induced mouse skin
tumors during the ‘promotion’ stage was evaluated
and the findings were summarized in Table 1. It is
prominent that topical application of TQF for
20 weeks in mice did not result in remarkable 
difference in body weight among all groups. There was
also an absence of observable tumor development in
group I (vehicle control) and groups VII-IX (treat-
ment control). Though, mice in the carcinogen 
control group (group II) exhibited tumor development
beginning from week 9 (data not shown). A 
distinguishing delay in tumor formation was noted in mice
treated with 30 mg/kg TQF (group V, week 11) and
10 mg/kg TQF (group IV, week 14). Surprisingly,
increasing TQF dosage seems to promote tumor 
development in which tumor was documented as early
as week 6 in mice treated with 100 mg/kg TQF
(group VI).
We also observed that, at the end of the study, group
IV (33.3 %) exhibited significantly lower (P < 0.05) 
percentage of tumor incidence than group II (60 %); whilst
the values escalated in mice treated with higher dosages
of TQF, accounting for 77.8 % and 100 % tumor 
incidence in groups V and VI, respectively. As the reference
compound, curcumin-treated group (group III) showed
only 25 % tumor incidence. Group IV (1.00 ± 0.00) also
showed significantly lower (P < 0.05) tumor burden than
group II (2.00 ± 0.37) and group III (1.50 ± 0.50); whilst
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 5 of 11
its tumor volume (1.48 ± 0.37 mm3) was comparable to
that of group III (4.59 ± 3.58 mm3), but at significantly
lower value (P < 0.05) than group II (7.62 ± 3.51 mm3).
Histopathological analysis
Microscopic examination of treated skin, with or 
without tumor formation, after 20 weeks of promotion
period showed presence of hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis
and/or parakeratosis, except for group I (Fig. 2). Tumors
formed showed papillomatous growth of benign 
characteristic with well-bordered basement membrane and no
evidence of invasion to indicate malignant changes. As
carcinogen control, group II showed hyperplastic 
epidermal layer along with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and
mild increment in the number of keratin pearls. Group
III, though, exhibited only mild epidermal hyperplasia.
Among TQF-treatment groups (groups IV-VI), the least
hyperplastic epidermal layer was observed in group IV,
followed by groups V and VI. Hyperkeratosis and 
parakeratosis were also observed in group VI; whilst group V
displayed only mild hyperkeratosis and group IV showed
an absence of both features. Increased formation of
keratin pearls was also noted in both groups V and VI.
Mild hyperplasia were observed in all treatment control
groups (groups VII-IX), in addition to mild 
hyperkeratosis and mild increment in the amount of keratin pearls
in group VIII, as well as mild hyperkeratosis, 
parakeratosis and severe increment in the number of keratin pearls
in group IX.
In situ cell death detection
Apoptotic effect of TQF on mouse skin tumor 
promotion was determined by using TUNEL assay, as depicted
in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b (representative micrographs). Upon
stimulation by carcinogens, we noticed an increase in
apoptotic index in group II (9.19 ± 0.76 %) in 
comparison to group I (5.39 ± 0.40 %). Conversely, group III
(6.72 ± 0.80 %) showed significantly reduced apoptotic
index (P < 0.05), whereas an approximate reduction of
1.6- and 1.3-fold were observed in group IV (5.92 ±
0.69 %) and group V (7.11 ± 0.55 %) respectively, with
respect to group II. Yet, an inconsequential to group II
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 6 of 11
apoptotic index was noted in group VI (8.26 ± 0.39 %). It
was also interesting to note that treatment with TQF
alone, without DMBA/TPA induction, increased 
apoptosis dose-dependently. Such findings infer a dual role of
TQF in modulating apoptotic effect in which lower
doses of TQF (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) provided 
safeguard against DMBA/TPA-induced apoptosis; whereas
higher dose of TQF (100 mg/kg) was found to potently

mediate DNA damage, even though in the absence of
carcinogens.
Biochemical analysis
In comparison to the carcinogen control [group II, 1.82
± 0.09 nmol malondialdehyde (MDA)/g tissue; Table 2],
we found that topical application of 10 mg/kg TQF
(group IV, 1.37 ± 0.16 nmol MDA/g tissue) significantly
Yeong et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:431 Page 7 of 11
reduced (P < 0.05) MDA production to a level that was
comparable to that of group III (1.30 ± 0.23 nmol MDA/
g tissue). Though, prominent deterioration of LPO was
demonstrated by mice in group VI (2.26 ± 0.19 nmol
MDA/g tissue). A similar trend was also observed in the
treatment control groups (groups VII-IX).
On the other hand, considerable depletion of GSH was
noted in group II (0.61 ± 0.06 μg/mg liver tissue), in 
relative to group I (0.84 ± 0.05 μg/mg liver tissue). 
Pretreatment with TQF on DMBA/TPA-induced mice restored
the depletion in dose-dependent manner, reporting 0.77,
0.89 and 0.95 μg/mg liver tissue for groups IV, V and VI
respectively, with insignificant difference among the
groups. Such protective effect by TQF was comparable to
those exerted by curcumin (group III, 0.95 ± 0.07 μg/mg
liver tissue). Though, treatment with TQF alone seems to
exert toxicity in mice wherein depleting GSH activities
were observed with parallel increment of TQF dosages.
Yet, astonishingly, high level of CAT was found in group
II (2.33 ± 0.14 U/μg protein). This could be an adaptive 
response of the mice to increasing oxidative stress induced
by DMBA/TPA application. The adaptive response was
apparently reduced with topical application of TQF
(groups IV-IX) and curcumin (group III), as indicated by
significant reduction of CAT activity (P < 0.05) in these
groups. We also observed an overall absence of significant
difference between groups in SOD activity which is 
indicative of an inconsequential protective role of such enzyme
in mediating antitumor promoting activity of TQF.
Protein expression of transcription factor via ELISA
Our results (Fig. 4) on the possible involvement of 
transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-1/c-jun, Nrf2) in mediating
antitumor promoting effect of TQF showed that TQF
inhibited tumor promotion in mouse skin by suppressing
NF-κB. This was indicated by marked reduction of 
ab-sorbance in NF-κB level in groups IV-IX in comparison to
group II (0.132 ± 0.003). The most noteworthy reduction
of NF-κB expression was seen in group V (0.103 ± 0.003),
at comparable level to that of group III (0.099 ± 0.004). As
a transcription factor that mainly governs cellular 
proliferation, AP-1/c-Jun protein expression was augmented in
group II (0.129 ± 0.008). The expression was also raised
with topical application of TQF (groups IV-VI) and 
curcumin (group III) at insignificant difference with respect to
group II. Such findings imply the restricted impact of
those treatments on AP-1 protein, viz. the treatments
caused neither further proliferation nor inhibition towards
mouse skin tumors development. On the other hand,
there was an overall insignificant difference of Nrf2 
protein expression level between groups. Though the 
difference is not statistically significant, decreased expressions
were noted in group II (0.108 ± 0.003) and group VI
(0.109 ± 0.007) when compared to group I (0.117 ± 0.010).
In comparison to group II, the Nrf2 protein level was 
increased upon treatment with 30 mg/kg TQF (group V,
0.128 ± 0.019) and was further augmented when 10 mg/kg
TQF (group IV, 0.150 ± 0.010) was applied to DMBA/
TPA-induced mice, thus suggesting a promising role of
TQF in up regulating Nrf2 expression at low dosages.
