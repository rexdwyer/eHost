Conclusions
In summary, CNX-010-49 is a selective and ‘pan’ tissue
acting, orally bioavailable 11β-HSD1 inhibitor. 
Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 with CNX-010-49 has
normalized most of metabolic dysregulations like 
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia along with
body weight.

>>>section: methods
Methods
Cell culture and treatment
C2C12 cells (Mouse myoblasts, ATCC) were maintained
in 24-well plates (3X104 cells/well) at 37°C in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) containing 25 mM
glucose and 10% FBS. When cells reached confluence, the
media was supplemented with 25 mM Glucose and 2% FBS
for myotubes formation. After 4 days of differentiation and
myotubes formation, cells were treated with media 
containing GPCI (25 mM glucose, 500 μM palmitate, 500 nM 
cortisone, 10 ng/ml of TNFα, IL-1β & IFγ) with or without
1 μM of CNX-010-49 for 18 h. Post 18 h, cells were frozen
in TRIZOL (Sigma, USA) for further analysis.
3T3-L1 cells (Mouse embryonic fibroblast, ATCC) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf
serum and 25 mM glucose. To induce the differentiation
of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, two days of post-confluence
cells were treated with complete differentiated media
(CDM) which contains 100 nM insulin, 400 nM 
cortisone or 1 μM dexamethasone, 500 μM IBMX (isobutyl-
methylxanthine) with or without 1 μM of CNX-010-49.
Media was changed for every 2 days with fresh media
containing 100 nM insulin and CNX-010-49 till day 6.
On day 7 cells were cultured in regular culture media
and after 24 h, triglyceride content of the cells were 
estimated (Diagnostic systems, Germany). One set of cells
were processed for Oil red O staining. Treated cells were
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed
in 10% formalin for 1 h and washed once with 60% 
isopropanol. Cells were then stained with 60% of filtered oil
red O stock solution (0.35 g of oil red O (Sigma, USA)
in 100 ml of 100% isopropanol) for 15 min. Cells were
washed thrice with water for 5 min each and later 
visualized under microscope.
For the measurement of adipocytes hypertrophy, mature
adipocytes were treated with media containing GPCI
(25 mM glucose, 500 μM palmitate, 500 nM cortisone,
Page 3 of 15
10 ng/ml of TNFα, IL-1β & IFγ) with or without 1 μM of
CNX-010-49 for 48 h. Post 48 h, cells were lysed and 
triglyceride content of the cells was estimated (Diagnostics
system, Germany).
For lipolysis assay, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells
(mature adipocytes) were treated with 1 μM of 
iso-proterenol and 100 nM cortisone with or without 1 μM
CNX-010-49 for 18 h. Glycerol released in the medium
was assayed using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma, USA).
Lipolysis data was normalized to total protein.
Isolation, culturing and hepatic glucose release in primary
hepatocytes
Hepatocytes from Swiss albino mice were prepared as
per the method of Seglen [33]. Hepatocytes were 
collected by centrifugation at 300 rpm for 3 min at 4°C.
The viability of the hepatocytes was measured by Trypan
blue exclusion and then seeded onto collagen coated 6
well/96-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing
20% FBS and 10 mM Nicotinamide and maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. After 3 h
of attachment, the medium was replaced with fresh
growth medium.
To measure glucose release from the hepatocytes, cells
were treated with gluconeogenesis inducing media (glu-
cose free DMEM media with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM 
pyruvate, 1 μM cortisone, 10 μM forskolin, 1% FBS with or
without 1 μM of CNX-010-49) for 18 h. Glucose 
released in the media was measured using GOD method
(Diagnostic systems, Germany). Values were normalized
to total protein. Also one set of treatment was processed
for gene expression analysis.
11β-HSD1 cell-based enzymatic activity assay
CHO-K1 (ATCC) cells stably expressing human 11β-
HSD1 gene (OriGene Technologies, USA) and fully 
differentiated subcutaneous human adipocytes (Zen-Bio,
Inc, USA) were used for determination of half-maximum
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of CNX-010-49 towards
human 11β-HSD1 isoform. Fully differentiated C2C12
cells (expressing native 11β-HSD1 protein) were used to
determine IC50 towards the mouse isoform.
For determination of IC50, CHO-K1 cells were seeded
in a serum free Ham’s F-12 media containing 400 nM 
cortisone and 500 μM NADPH with or without CNX-010-49.
Inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in media
serially to get different concentration to determine IC50
(8 concentrations were used starting from 0.001 nM to
3 μM). Post 18 h treatment, the culture media was 
analyzed for the inhibition of cortisone to cortisol conversion
using LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP). Similar protocol
was followed with C2C12 cells to determine IC50 (from 1
nM to 3 μM) for mouse isoform.

HSD-related enzymes cell-based activity assay
CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing human 11β-HSD2
and 17β-HSD3 gene (OriGene Technologies, USA) and
T47D (ATCC) breast cancer cell line that expresses 17β-
HSD1 were used to determine inhibitory constants 
towards the respective enzymes.
For determination of inhibition towards HSD-related
enzymes; cortisol was used as substrate for 11β-HSD2
(which will be converted to cortisone), androstenedione
for 17β-HSD3 (converted to testosterone) and estrone
for 17β-HSD1 (converted to estradiol). Post 18 h of
treatment, the culture media was analyzed and inhibition
of respective substrate conversion was analyzed using
LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP).
11β-HSD1 reductase and dehydrogenase enzymatic assay
N-terminal deleted human 11β-HSD1 pure protein
(cloned, expressed using pET27b vector in bacteria and
later purified in-house using Ni-NTA agarose beads) was
used to evaluate both reductase and dehydrogenase 
enzymatic activity. For reductase activity, the reaction 
buffer contained 200 nM cortisone and 500 μM NADPH.
For dehydrogenase activity, the reaction buffer contain
200 nM cortisol and 500 μM NADP. After 4 h 
incubation at 37°C, converted cortisol or cortisone was 
analyzed using LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP).
In vivo efficacy studies in C57BL/6j mice on high fat diet
Six week old male C57BL/6 J mice were housed 2 per
polypropylene cage, maintained at 23 ± 1°C, 60 ± 10%
humidity, exposed to 12 h cycles of light and dark. 
Control group (n =8) animals were fed a standard chow diet
(D10001; 10% kcal from fat); HFD (high fat diet) group
(n = 16) fed high fat diet (D12492; 60% kcal from
Research Diets, Inc., New Jersey, USA). After 11 weeks
of diet intervention, the HFD fed animals were 
randomized to either vehicle (HFD control) or CNX-01-49
(30 mg/kg, orally twice a day in 0.5% Carboxy methyl
cellulose) treatment groups (n = 8) based upon body
weight, glucose AUC during OGTT and fasting blood
glucose. The treatment was further continued for 
another 10 weeks. Body weight, glucose in fasting (6 h)
and fed state, triglycerides in fasting (12 h) state were
measured weekly and plasma insulin was measured at
the end of study. At the end of the study, blood was 
collected for determination of plasma glycerol and leptin
levels following which the mice were euthanized under
isoflurane anaesthesia and necropsied. Adipose tissues
were weighed and a portion was immediately collected
in formalin and processed for histological examination.
Animal experiment protocols and experimental procedures
were approved by the Connexios Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee which is in accordance with the 
ARRIVE guidelines (Additional file 1) [34].

Quantitative PCR analysis
At the end of treatment periods, total RNA was extracted
from different tissues using TRIZOL. Equal amount of
RNA was reverse transcribed and later amplified using
specific primers. Beta-actin was used as an internal 
control for the quantitative analysis. The primer sequence is
available upon request.
DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR assay for
mitochondrial copy number
DNA from C2C12 myotubes was isolated using Phenol
extraction method. Quantitative real-time PCR was 
performed for mtND1 (mitochondrial gene) using DNA as
template and normalized to HPRT (nuclear gene) gene.
Blood and plasma assay
Blood glucose was measured using hand-held 
Accu-check glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). An
ultra-sensitive insulin enzyme-linked 
immunosorb-ent assay (ELISA) kit (Downers Grove, USA) was
used to determine plasma insulin levels. Circulating
serum TG, plasma glycerol and leptin were estimated
using the TG estimation kit (Diagnostic systems,
Germany), glycerol estimation kit (Sigma, USA) and
Leptin estimation kit (R & D systems, USA) 
respectively as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Ex vivo 11β-HSD1 inhibition assay
The duration and percent inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity
by CNX-010-49 (30 mg/kg, single dose orally) in different
tissues (liver, adipose, skeletal muscle and brain) in Swiss
albino mice was evaluated by an ex vivo 11β-HSD1 
inhibition assay. We have used 4 animals for every time point
in the study. After dosing the animals orally, animals were
sacrificed at each time point and different tissues (liver,
skeletal muscle, adipose and brain) were removed, minced
and incubated with cortisone for 16 h. Converted cortisol
was measured by LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP) and the
percent inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity relative to
vehicle-treated controls was calculated.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
After a 6 h fast, CNX-010-49 or vehicle was administered
60 min prior to administration of glucose (2 g/kg body wt)
by oral gavage. Blood samples were collected from the tail
vein 60 min before treatment and at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90
and 120 min after glucose load for estimating glucose.
Insulin tolerance test (ITT)
ITT was performed in 6 h fasted mice during 9th week
of treatment. Blood samples were collected prior to and
at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after insulin (human R Insulin,
Eli Lilly) administration (2 IU/kg, i.p.) for glucose
estimation.

Pyruvate tolerance test (PTT)
Pyruvate Tolerance Test (PTT) was performed in 
overnight fasted mice during 10th week of treatment. Blood
samples were collected from the tail vein 60 min before
treatment and at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after
pyruvate load (2 g/kg, intraperitonial) for estimating 
glucose. The data was analyzed for change in glucose levels
in CNX-010-49 treated animals when compared with
HFD control.
Measurement of thermogenesis
For the cold exposure experiment, mice were housed 
individually and transferred to a cold environment with an
ambient temperature of 4°C. Body temperature was
assessed at the end of treatment period using a rectal
probe. Temperature was measured for every 15 min for
60-75 min and animals were then brought to room
temperature.
Estimation of liver TG
Liver TG was extracted according to Folch’s method.
The TG from liver homogenate was extracted with
chloroform: methanol (2:1) mixture, the organic layer
dried in a speed vac, re-suspended in isopropyl alcohol
and liver TG content was analyzed by using TG 
estimation kit (Diagnostic systems, Germany).
Adipose tissue collection, immunofluorescence and image
analysis
Subcutaneous adipose tissue was removed and was fixed
in 10% buffered neutral formalin. It was then embedded
in paraffin, sectioned and stained. All adipose sections
were viewed at 40X magnification, and images were 
captured using Zeiss microscope connected via camera to a
computer (progres® capture pro 2.1 camera). Adipocytes
size measurement was performed using a 
computer-assisted image analysis progres® capture pro software.
From each animal 10 images were measured. The area of
each adipocyte was measured by tracing the cell boundary
on the images captured. All adipocytes that had complete
cell boundary were measured. Data obtained after 
measurement were averaged to individual animal and later
group mean and SEM were calculated.
For PRDM16 and UCP1 immuno staining, 
subcutaneous adipose sections were de-paraffinized and blocked in
1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT and incubated with
PRDM16 (ProSci, USA) or UCP1(Abcam, USA) primary
antibodies for 90 min at RT, followed by washing with
PBS. Sections were then incubated with secondary 
antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 secondary 
antibody, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 30 min at RT and
mounted using fluromount. Localization of PRDM16 and
UCP1 were assessed and the images were captured at 40X
magnification.

Assessment of JNK and eIF2α phosphorylation
At the end of treatment period, 10 mg of muscle (soleus)
and subcutaneous adipose tissues were collected from
each animal in respective groups. Lysates were prepared
by homogenization and 50 μg lysate from each group
was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto 
nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies against
phospho-JNK, phospho-eIF2α, total JNK and Actin (Cell
signaling, USA) and developed by enhanced 
chemilu-minescence (West Pico, Thermo Scientific, USA).
Estimation of serum biomarkers
Serum was collected at the end of the study and ELISA
(Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) was performed
as per the kit protocol to measure changes in leptin
(R&D system), PAI-1 (Invitrogen), Fetuin-A (Uscn Life
Science Inc) and IL-6 (R&D systems) levels in the
serum.
Statistical analysis
Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA)
was used for statistical analysis. All the values are
expressed as Mean ± SEM and ‘n’ indicates the number
of animals in each group. When only two groups were
analyzed, statistical comparison was conducted by 
One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. Repeated 
measure based parameters (such as weekly fasting glucose,
serum triglycerides and body weight) were analyzed
using two-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed
by Bonferroni correction (with time and diet/inhibitor
treatment as factors). Statistical details (p-value, F, and
degree of freedom (Df)) are provided in the figure 
legends along with the results of the two-way ANOVA 
testing. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Abstract
Background: 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type1 (11β-HSD1) converts inactive glucocorticoids to active
glucocorticoids which, in excess, leads to development of the various risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.
Recent studies clearly suggest that both increased expression and activity of 11β-HSD1 in metabolically active tissues
such as liver, muscle and adipose are implicated in tissue specific dysregulation which collectively contribute to the
whole body pathology seen in metabolic syndrome. In the present study we have evaluated CNX-010-49, a highly
potent, selective and ‘pan tissue’ acting 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, for its potential to modulate multiple risk factors of
the metabolic syndrome.
Methods: Male C57B6/J mice on high fat diet (DIO mice) were orally dosed with CNX-010-49 (30 mg/kg twice
daily; n = 8) or vehicle for 10 weeks. Fasting glucose, triglycerides, glycerol, free fatty acids, body weight and feed
intake were measured at selected time points. At the end of the treatment an OGTT and subsequently organ
histology was performed. In vitro, CNX-010-49 was evaluated in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to assess impact on
adipocytes differentiation, hypertrophy and lipolysis whereas in fully differentiated C2C12 cells and in primary
mouse hepatocytes to assess the impact on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose output respectively.
Results: CNX-010-49 a highly potent and selective pan tissue acting 11β-HSD1 inhibitor (EC50 = 6 nM) significantly
inhibits glucocorticoids and isoproterenol mediated lipolysis in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, improves muscle
glucose oxidation, reduces proteolysis and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. Also a significant inhibition of
gluconeogenesis in primary mouse hepatocytes was observed. The treatment with CNX-010-49 resulted in a
significant decrease in fasting glucose, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Treatment also resulted
in a significant decrease in serum triglycerides levels and a complete inhibition of body weight gain without
affecting feed consumption. A significant reduction in the serum biomarkers like Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Fetuin-A with CNX-010-49 treatment was observed indicating a potential to modulate
processes implicated in cardiovascular benefits.

Conclusions: These results indicate that inhibition of 11β-HSD1 with CNX-010-49 can give a potential benefit in the
management of metabolic dysregulations that are seen in type 2 diabetes.
Keywords: 11β-HSD1, CNX-010-49, Glucose, Insulin sensitivity, Triglycerides, Adipogenesis and Body weight,
Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular risks
Background
Glucocorticoids (GCs) play a critical role in multiple
metabolic processes, including glucose homeostasis, 
insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Also it is well
established that elevated glucocorticoid levels is linked
with increased cardiovascular events [1]. Metabolic 
syndrome and Cushing’s syndrome have some similar 
phenotypes that include hyperglycemia, visceral obesity,
dyslipidemia and insulin resistance [2].
There are two isoforms of 11β-Hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase. 11β-HSD1 which converts the inactive 11β-keto
form (cortisone in humans and 11-dehydrocorticosterone
in rodents) to the active 11β-hydroxylated GCs (cortisol in
human and corticosterone in mice) [3]. It is expressed
primarily in GC target tissues such as liver, skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue and in the central nervous system
where it amplifies local GC action [4]. 11βHSD2 is
highly expressed in classical aldosterone-selective target
tissues, such as kidney [5] and prevents the 
inappropriate activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol.
In conditions of excess NADPH, as seen in metabolic
overload; 11β-HSD1 functions as a reductase and 
generates active cortisol while in situations of low levels of
NADPH it functions as a dehydrogenase and generates
inactive cortisone [6]. In humans, in vivo dehydrogenase
activity of 11β-HSD1 has been demonstrated [7].
Animals administered GCs show similar dysregulation
in phenotype as seen in metabolic syndrome or T2DM
where they observed increased fasting hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia and impaired β-cell response to oral 
glucose challenge. These animals have shown hepatic 
steato-sis and increased ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle [8].
In adipocytes GCs increase lipolysis and hypertrophy in
mature adipocytes [9] whereas in muscle GCs can 
increase proteolysis and insulin resistance. In another study,
infusion of GCs has also shown in addition to the above
observations hyperleptinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
significant decrease in uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 and
UCP-3 expression [10]. The loss of UCP1 expression is
shown to be attendant with decrease in non-shivering
thermogenesis [11,12].
In metabolic syndrome, the pathology is due to 
enhanced tissue level glucocorticoids [13]. Targeted 
disruption of the 11β-HSD1 leads to improvement in glucose
tolerance, improved lipid profile along with decreased 
gluconeogenic response [14]. Mice over expressing adipose
Page 2 of 15
11β-HSD1 develop visceral obesity which is further 
exacerbated by feeding high fat diet. These mice later 
developed all the phenotypes of metabolic syndrome including
hypertension [15,16].
11β-HSD1 expression and activity are significantly 
increased in both skeletal muscle and fat tissue from
obese type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients and also in
rodent models of disease suggesting a role for local 
glucocorticoids re-amplification in the development of
obesity and the metabolic syndrome [13,17-20]. Also 
increased 11β-HSD1 expression and activation in liver
and adipose has demonstrated a clear link between its
roles to T2DM as seen with glucose intolerance, 
increased insulin resistance, increased adiposity and body
weight gain [21,22]. The concomitant increase in 
glucocorticoids in adipose leads to decreased adiponectin
levels, increased TNFα and fasting glucose whereas 
hepatic overexpression increased insulinemia, LDL cholesterol
and serum glucose levels. One study established the 
association impaired insulin signaling and 11β-HSD1 
ex-pression/activity in skeletal muscle where dexamethasone
treated myotubes showed reduced IRS1 expression, 
increased Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 and reduced
downstream pSer473 Akt/PKB [23].
Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 in different
rodent models has demonstrated an improvement in
glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity as well as reduced
body weight gain [24-30]. Also 11β-HSD1 inhibition 
reduced serum triglycerides, cholesterol and frees fatty
acids levels. Importantly, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 
reduces plaque progression and aortic cholesterol 
accumulation murine model of atherosclerosis.
To date a few small molecule inhibitors of 11β-HSD1
have entered clinical studies. INCB13739 displayed 
statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and glucose in
T2DM patients where metformin monotherapy was 
inadequate [31]. MK-0916 decreased both blood pressure
and body weight with a trend to reduce waist 
circumference and had no significant effect on blood glucose [32].
So far none of these interventions provided significant
overall protection from metabolic syndrome. One can
attribute this lack efficacy of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors may
be due to potential reversibility of the 11β-HSD1 
enzymatic reaction. Selection of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors which 
inhibit reductase activity than dehydrogenase activity and
getting maximum inhibition in skeletal muscle apart
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
from adipose and liver is very important. So there is still
a need for intervention that alters 11β-HSD1 enzyme 
activity and thereby provides a significant benefit in the
management of metabolic syndrome.
Our understanding of 11β-HSD1 biology linking to
metabolic syndrome suggests that inhibition of 11β-HSD1
with highly potent compound in all the metabolically 
active tissues like adipose, skeletal muscle and liver, will 
provide a complete benefit in controlling the disease. Also we
screened and selected the compounds that have shown
more inhibition of reductase activity than dehydrogenase
activity along with good tissue distribution and inhibition
in the above mentioned tissues. In this study, we have
evaluated CNX-010-49 (MW= 408.5), a highly potent and
selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor for its potential to control
multiple facets of metabolic syndrome.
Methods
Cell culture and treatment
C2C12 cells (Mouse myoblasts, ATCC) were maintained
in 24-well plates (3X104 cells/well) at 37°C in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) containing 25 mM
glucose and 10% FBS. When cells reached confluence, the
media was supplemented with 25 mM Glucose and 2% FBS
for myotubes formation. After 4 days of differentiation and
myotubes formation, cells were treated with media 
containing GPCI (25 mM glucose, 500 μM palmitate, 500 nM 
cortisone, 10 ng/ml of TNFα, IL-1β & IFγ) with or without
1 μM of CNX-010-49 for 18 h. Post 18 h, cells were frozen
in TRIZOL (Sigma, USA) for further analysis.
3T3-L1 cells (Mouse embryonic fibroblast, ATCC) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf
serum and 25 mM glucose. To induce the differentiation
of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, two days of post-confluence
cells were treated with complete differentiated media
(CDM) which contains 100 nM insulin, 400 nM 
cortisone or 1 μM dexamethasone, 500 μM IBMX (isobutyl-
methylxanthine) with or without 1 μM of CNX-010-49.
Media was changed for every 2 days with fresh media
containing 100 nM insulin and CNX-010-49 till day 6.
On day 7 cells were cultured in regular culture media
and after 24 h, triglyceride content of the cells were 
estimated (Diagnostic systems, Germany). One set of cells
were processed for Oil red O staining. Treated cells were
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed
in 10% formalin for 1 h and washed once with 60% 
isopropanol. Cells were then stained with 60% of filtered oil
red O stock solution (0.35 g of oil red O (Sigma, USA)
in 100 ml of 100% isopropanol) for 15 min. Cells were
washed thrice with water for 5 min each and later 
visualized under microscope.
For the measurement of adipocytes hypertrophy, mature
adipocytes were treated with media containing GPCI
(25 mM glucose, 500 μM palmitate, 500 nM cortisone,
Page 3 of 15
10 ng/ml of TNFα, IL-1β & IFγ) with or without 1 μM of
CNX-010-49 for 48 h. Post 48 h, cells were lysed and 
triglyceride content of the cells was estimated (Diagnostics
system, Germany).
For lipolysis assay, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells
(mature adipocytes) were treated with 1 μM of 
isoproterenol and 100 nM cortisone with or without 1 μM
CNX-010-49 for 18 h. Glycerol released in the medium
was assayed using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma, USA).
Lipolysis data was normalized to total protein.
Isolation, culturing and hepatic glucose release in primary
hepatocytes
Hepatocytes from Swiss albino mice were prepared as
per the method of Seglen [33]. Hepatocytes were 
collected by centrifugation at 300 rpm for 3 min at 4°C.
The viability of the hepatocytes was measured by Trypan
blue exclusion and then seeded onto collagen coated 6
well/96-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing
20% FBS and 10 mM Nicotinamide and maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. After 3 h
of attachment, the medium was replaced with fresh
growth medium.
To measure glucose release from the hepatocytes, cells
were treated with gluconeogenesis inducing media (glu-
cose free DMEM media with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM 
pyruvate, 1 μM cortisone, 10 μM forskolin, 1% FBS with or
without 1 μM of CNX-010-49) for 18 h. Glucose 
released in the media was measured using GOD method
(Diagnostic systems, Germany). Values were normalized
to total protein. Also one set of treatment was processed
for gene expression analysis.
11β-HSD1 cell-based enzymatic activity assay
CHO-K1 (ATCC) cells stably expressing human 11β-
HSD1 gene (OriGene Technologies, USA) and fully 
differentiated subcutaneous human adipocytes (Zen-Bio,
Inc, USA) were used for determination of half-maximum
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of CNX-010-49 towards
human 11β-HSD1 isoform. Fully differentiated C2C12
cells (expressing native 11β-HSD1 protein) were used to
determine IC50 towards the mouse isoform.
For determination of IC50, CHO-K1 cells were seeded
in a serum free Ham’s F-12 media containing 400 nM 
cortisone and 500 μM NADPH with or without CNX-010-49.
Inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in media
serially to get different concentration to determine IC50
(8 concentrations were used starting from 0.001 nM to
3 μM). Post 18 h treatment, the culture media was 
analyzed for the inhibition of cortisone to cortisol conversion
using LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP). Similar protocol
was followed with C2C12 cells to determine IC50 (from 1
nM to 3 μM) for mouse isoform.

HSD-related enzymes cell-based activity assay
CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing human 11β-HSD2
and 17β-HSD3 gene (OriGene Technologies, USA) and
T47D (ATCC) breast cancer cell line that expresses 17β-
HSD1 were used to determine inhibitory constants 
towards the respective enzymes.
For determination of inhibition towards HSD-related
enzymes; cortisol was used as substrate for 11β-HSD2
(which will be converted to cortisone), androstenedione
for 17β-HSD3 (converted to testosterone) and estrone
for 17β-HSD1 (converted to estradiol). Post 18 h of
treatment, the culture media was analyzed and inhibition
of respective substrate conversion was analyzed using
LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP).
11β-HSD1 reductase and dehydrogenase enzymatic assay
N-terminal deleted human 11β-HSD1 pure protein
(cloned, expressed using pET27b vector in bacteria and
later purified in-house using Ni-NTA agarose beads) was
used to evaluate both reductase and dehydrogenase 
enzymatic activity. For reductase activity, the reaction 
buffer contained 200 nM cortisone and 500 μM NADPH.
For dehydrogenase activity, the reaction buffer contain
200 nM cortisol and 500 μM NADP. After 4 h 
incubation at 37°C, converted cortisol or cortisone was 
analyzed using LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP).
In vivo efficacy studies in C57BL/6j mice on high fat diet
Six week old male C57BL/6 J mice were housed 2 per
polypropylene cage, maintained at 23 ± 1°C, 60 ± 10%
humidity, exposed to 12 h cycles of light and dark. 
Control group (n =8) animals were fed a standard chow diet
(D10001; 10% kcal from fat); HFD (high fat diet) group
(n = 16) fed high fat diet (D12492; 60% kcal from
Research Diets, Inc., New Jersey, USA). After 11 weeks
of diet intervention, the HFD fed animals were 
randomized to either vehicle (HFD control) or CNX-01-49
(30 mg/kg, orally twice a day in 0.5% Carboxy methyl
cellulose) treatment groups (n = 8) based upon body
weight, glucose AUC during OGTT and fasting blood
glucose. The treatment was further continued for 
another 10 weeks. Body weight, glucose in fasting (6 h)
and fed state, triglycerides in fasting (12 h) state were
measured weekly and plasma insulin was measured at
the end of study. At the end of the study, blood was 
collected for determination of plasma glycerol and leptin
levels following which the mice were euthanized under
isoflurane anaesthesia and necropsied. Adipose tissues
were weighed and a portion was immediately collected
in formalin and processed for histological examination.
Animal experiment protocols and experimental procedures
were approved by the Connexios Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee which is in accordance with the 
ARRIVE guidelines (Additional file 1) [34].

Quantitative PCR analysis
At the end of treatment periods, total RNA was extracted
from different tissues using TRIZOL. Equal amount of
RNA was reverse transcribed and later amplified using
specific primers. Beta-actin was used as an internal 
control for the quantitative analysis. The primer sequence is
available upon request.
DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR assay for
mitochondrial copy number
DNA from C2C12 myotubes was isolated using Phenol
extraction method. Quantitative real-time PCR was 
performed for mtND1 (mitochondrial gene) using DNA as
template and normalized to HPRT (nuclear gene) gene.
Blood and plasma assay
Blood glucose was measured using hand-held 
Accu-check glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). An
ultra-sensitive insulin enzyme-linked 
immunosorb-ent assay (ELISA) kit (Downers Grove, USA) was
used to determine plasma insulin levels. Circulating
serum TG, plasma glycerol and leptin were estimated
using the TG estimation kit (Diagnostic systems,
Germany), glycerol estimation kit (Sigma, USA) and
Leptin estimation kit (R & D systems, USA) 
respectively as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Ex vivo 11β-HSD1 inhibition assay
The duration and percent inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity
by CNX-010-49 (30 mg/kg, single dose orally) in different
tissues (liver, adipose, skeletal muscle and brain) in Swiss
albino mice was evaluated by an ex vivo 11β-HSD1 
inhibition assay. We have used 4 animals for every time point
in the study. After dosing the animals orally, animals were
sacrificed at each time point and different tissues (liver,
skeletal muscle, adipose and brain) were removed, minced
and incubated with cortisone for 16 h. Converted cortisol
was measured by LCMS/MS (ABI-4000 QTRAP) and the
percent inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity relative to
vehicle-treated controls was calculated.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
After a 6 h fast, CNX-010-49 or vehicle was administered
60 min prior to administration of glucose (2 g/kg body wt)
by oral gavage. Blood samples were collected from the tail
vein 60 min before treatment and at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90
and 120 min after glucose load for estimating glucose.
Insulin tolerance test (ITT)
ITT was performed in 6 h fasted mice during 9th week
of treatment. Blood samples were collected prior to and
at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after insulin (human R Insulin,
Eli Lilly) administration (2 IU/kg, i.p.) for glucose
estimation.

Pyruvate tolerance test (PTT)
Pyruvate Tolerance Test (PTT) was performed in 
overnight fasted mice during 10th week of treatment. Blood
samples were collected from the tail vein 60 min before
treatment and at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after
pyruvate load (2 g/kg, intraperitonial) for estimating 
glucose. The data was analyzed for change in glucose levels
in CNX-010-49 treated animals when compared with
HFD control.
Measurement of thermogenesis
For the cold exposure experiment, mice were housed 
individually and transferred to a cold environment with an
ambient temperature of 4°C. Body temperature was
assessed at the end of treatment period using a rectal
probe. Temperature was measured for every 15 min for
60-75 min and animals were then brought to room
temperature.
Estimation of liver TG
Liver TG was extracted according to Folch’s method.
The TG from liver homogenate was extracted with
chloroform: methanol (2:1) mixture, the organic layer
dried in a speed vac, re-suspended in isopropyl alcohol
and liver TG content was analyzed by using TG 
estimation kit (Diagnostic systems, Germany).
Adipose tissue collection, immunofluorescence and image
analysis
Subcutaneous adipose tissue was removed and was fixed
in 10% buffered neutral formalin. It was then embedded
in paraffin, sectioned and stained. All adipose sections
were viewed at 40X magnification, and images were 
captured using Zeiss microscope connected via camera to a
computer (progres® capture pro 2.1 camera). Adipocytes
size measurement was performed using a 
computer-assisted image analysis progres® capture pro software.
From each animal 10 images were measured. The area of
each adipocyte was measured by tracing the cell boundary
on the images captured. All adipocytes that had complete
cell boundary were measured. Data obtained after 
measurement were averaged to individual animal and later
group mean and SEM were calculated.
For PRDM16 and UCP1 immuno staining, 
subcutaneous adipose sections were de-paraffinized and blocked in
1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT and incubated with
PRDM16 (ProSci, USA) or UCP1(Abcam, USA) primary
antibodies for 90 min at RT, followed by washing with
PBS. Sections were then incubated with secondary 
antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 secondary 
antibody, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 30 min at RT and
mounted using fluromount. Localization of PRDM16 and
UCP1 were assessed and the images were captured at 40X
magnification.

Assessment of JNK and eIF2α phosphorylation
At the end of treatment period, 10 mg of muscle (soleus)
and subcutaneous adipose tissues were collected from
each animal in respective groups. Lysates were prepared
by homogenization and 50 μg lysate from each group
was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto 
nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies against
phospho-JNK, phospho-eIF2α, total JNK and Actin (Cell
signaling, USA) and developed by enhanced 
chemilu-minescence (West Pico, Thermo Scientific, USA).
Estimation of serum biomarkers
Serum was collected at the end of the study and ELISA
(Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) was performed
as per the kit protocol to measure changes in leptin
(R&D system), PAI-1 (Invitrogen), Fetuin-A (Uscn Life
Science Inc) and IL-6 (R&D systems) levels in the
serum.
Statistical analysis
Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA)
was used for statistical analysis. All the values are
expressed as Mean ± SEM and ‘n’ indicates the number
of animals in each group. When only two groups were
analyzed, statistical comparison was conducted by 
One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. Repeated 
measure based parameters (such as weekly fasting glucose,
serum triglycerides and body weight) were analyzed
using two-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed
by Bonferroni correction (with time and diet/inhibitor
treatment as factors). Statistical details (p-value, F, and
degree of freedom (Df)) are provided in the figure 
legends along with the results of the two-way ANOVA 
testing. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
CNX-010-49 is a highly potent, selective inhibitor and has
a good pharmacodynamic activity
CNX-010-49 is a highly potent 11β-HSD1 inhibitor 
towards both human and mouse isoforms with an IC50 of
6 nM and 64 nM respectively (Figure 1A & B) as 
established from cells over expressing human 11β-HSD1 in
CHO-K1 cell and fully differentiated mouse C2C12 
myotubes respectively. IC50 for CNX-010-49 in primary
human mature adipocytes is 13 nM (Figure 1C). 
CNX-010-49 inhibits reductase activity more than 
dehydrogenase activity (>100X, Figure 1D). CNX-010-49 is highly 
selective inhibitor with no inhibition up to 100 μM towards
11β-HSD2, 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD3 (Figure 1E, F & G).
In a single dose pharmacodynamic activity evaluation in
Swiss albino mice, oral administration of CNX-010-49 at
30 mg/kg inhibited 11β-HSD1 activity by 58% and 24% at
1 h and 7 h respectively in liver. In adipose, the inhibition
was 41% at 1 h and continued to be same till 7 h. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
skeletal muscle, the inhibition was ~38% at 1 h and 7 h.
At end of 24 h, there was no inhibition of 11β-HSD1
observed (data not shown). However there was no 
inhibition observed in brain (Table 1).
CNX-010-49 decreases liver gluconeogenic activity in
primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes and hence has a
potential to control fasting glucose
In the presence of gluconeogenic substrates (lactate and
pyruvate) along with signaling molecules (forskolin and
glucocorticoids), mouse hepatocytes showed a significant
increase in hepatic glucose release along with increase in
mRNA expression of both G6PC (glucose-6-phosphat-
ase, catalytic subunit) and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase) (5 and 9 fold increase respectively against
control cells) which are the key mediators of hepatic 
glucose production. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by 1 μM of
CNX-010-49 significantly reduced hepatic glucose 
release by ~45% and mRNA expression of both G6PC and
After oral administration of CNX-010-49 at 30 mg/kg (single dose) to Swiss albino mice (n = 4 per time point), pharmacodynamic activity of CNX-010-49 at different
time points was measured in liver, muscle, adipose and brain tissues ex vivo as described in Methods.

PEPCK (40% and 70% respectively) indicating a potential
of CNX-010-49 to reduce fasting glucose (Figure 2A-C).
CNX-010-49 increases muscle glucose oxidation, reduces
muscle proteolysis and increases mitochondrial biogenesis
In C2C12 myotubes, the presence of excess free fatty
acids, inflammatory cytokines and cortisone (in vitro 
disease mimicking condition); PDK4 (pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase 4) mRNA expression was increased by more
than 4 fold as compared to vehicle control. Inhibition of
11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 reduced PDK4 expression by
40% (Figure 3A). Under the similar condition, we 
observed around 2 fold increase in mRNA expression of
TRIM63 (tripartite motif containing 63; an E3 
ubiquitin-protein ligase which is known to enhance muscle 
prote-olysis) as compared to vehicle control. Treatment with
CNX-010-49 reduced the expression by 30% (Figure 3B).
Mitochondrial copy number was decreased by ~75%
under disease mimicking condition compared to vehicle

control. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 
restored the mitochondrial number (Figure 3C).
CNX-010-49 inhibits both adipocytes differentiation,
lipolysis and hypertrophy
Conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol by
11β-HSD1 favors adipogenesis. CNX-010-49 treatment
reduced the differentiation/adipogenesis capacity by 34%
as measured by accumulation of triglycerides in 
adipocytes as well as by oil red O staining (Figure 4A & B).
Both cortisone and isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis by 2
fold in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes as measured by the 
release of glycerol in the culture medium. CNX-010-49
treatment reduced adipocytes lipolysis by 25% (Figure 4C).
Excess metabolic overload and inflammation mediated
hypertrophy of adipocytes as measured by enhanced 
triglyceride accumulation, was reduced by 35% with 
CNX-010-49 treatment (Figure 4D).
CNX-010-49 reduces fasting blood glucose in DIO mice
Compared to the lean control animals the HFD control
animals exhibited a significant increase in fasting glucose
(136 ± 6 vs. 200 ± 8 mg/dl; P < 0.001) during the entire
study period, indicating development of insulin resistance
and hyperglycemia (Figure 5A). In CNX-010-49 treated
animals, fasting glucose started decreasing from week 5 of
Page 8 of 15
treatment and by the end of treatment period reached a
significant 15% reduction (170 ± 6 vs 200 ± 5 mg/dl; P <
0.01) when compared with the HFD control mice.
We evaluated the gluconeogenic state of liver before
terminations of the study by performing a pyruvate 
tolerance test where animals were challenged with 
gluconeogenic substrate pyruvate and glucose levels in serum
was measured. Compared to lean control animals, HFD
animals showed an increase in serum glucose AUC
(20736 ± 1013 vs 26511 ± 2057) upon pyruvate challenge.
When compared with HFD control animals, CNX-01-49
treatment resulted in significant decrease in glucose
AUC (26511 ± 2057 vs 22775 ± 97) amounting to a ~15%
suggesting decreased gluconeogenesis (Figure 5B).
The HFD control animals showed an ~25% and ~50%
increase in fasting glycerol and free fatty acid levels 
respectively when compared to lean control animals. 
CNX-010-49 treated animals showed ~18% and 20% (P < 0.05)
decrease in fasting glycerol and free fatty acids respectively
(Figure 5C & D). This indicates that treatment with 
CNX-010-49 modulates adipocytes physiology and reduces 
supply of pro-gluconeogenic substrates to the liver.
CNX-010-49 improves glucose tolerance in DIO mice
To examine whether glucose intolerance in HFD mice
was improved by the CNX-010-49 treatment, an oral
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
glucose tolerance test was performed at the end of the
treatment. Upon oral glucose challenge, a significant 
increase in the glucose excursion in HFD mice were 
observed when compared to lean control (AUC of 57376 ±
1382 in HFD control vs 33803 ± 1919 in lean control; P <
0.001). However CNX-010-49 treatment showed ~13%
decrease in glucose levels (49680 ± 734 in treatment vs
57376 ± 1382 in HFD control; P < 0.05) indicating the 
potential of CNX-010-49 to reduce post prandial 
hyperglycemia (Figure 6B).
CNX-010-49 reduces hyper insulinemia and improves
peripheral insulin sensitivity
In comparison with the lean control animals, HFD control
animals showed significant increase in fasting insulin
levels (0.59 ± 0.07 vs 1.94 ± 0.29 ng/ml; P < 0.001). 
Treatment with CNX-010-49 significantly lowered plasma 
insulin levels by ~40% (0.89 ± 0.11 vs 1.94 ± 0.29 ng/ml; P <
0.05) when compared with the hyperinsulinemic HFD
animals (Figure 6A). A similar trend was observed with
fed insulin. Along with reduced insulin levels, insulin
sensitivity was significantly improved in CNX-010-49
treated animals as evident from improved insulin 
tolerance test, reduced skeletal muscle phospho-JNK and
reduced subcutaneous adipose phospho-eIF2α levels
(Figure 6C, D & E). Also we observed a significant
decrease in mRNA expressions of PDK4 and TRIM63
in muscle tissue of CNX-010-49 treated animals 
indicating a possible improvement in glucose oxidation
(Figure 6F & G).
CNX-010-49 improves lipid profile in DIO mice
The effect of treatment on circulating TG levels is 
represented in Figure 7A.
In HFD control animals, the TG was increased by ~1.7
fold (210 ± 8 mg/dl; P < 0.001) when compared to lean
control (128 ± 8 mg/dl) during the study period. On the
other hand, the HFD fed animals treated with CNX-010-
49 showed ~20% reduction in TG levels (165 ± 9 mg/dl;
P < 0.001) when compared to HFD control. The decrease
in plasma TG upon CNX-010-49 treatment was 
observed from week 1 and was maintained throughout the
study period. Also CNX-010-49 treatment has shown a
non-significant reduction in the liver TG levels as 
compared to HFD control (Figure 7B).
We analyzed expression of fatty acid transporter CD36
and PPARα which is involved in fat oxidation in liver 
tissue. As expected expression of CD36 increased by ~1.5
fold and a significant decrease in PPARα in HFD animals
as compared to lean control indicating increased fat
Page 9 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
uptake and decreased fatty acid oxidation. Treatment
with CNX-010-49 showed a decrease in CD36 and 
increased PPARα expression indicating a decreased fat 
uptake and improved fat oxidation in liver as evident from
decreased liver and serum TG levels (Figure 7C & D).
CNX-010-49 has a potential to improve thermogenesis
and reduce body weight
In the lean control animals, a gradual increase in body
weight was observed during the 10 weeks study period
(25.6 g to 28.1 g). In contrast, body weight of HFD 
control animals showed a rapid increase and recorded ~18%
increase by end of the study (34.7 g to 41 g). Treatment
with CNX-010-49 prevented the weight gain by ~20%
(Figure 8A) without any change in the feed consumption
(data not shown). We did not observe any significant 
increase in body weight from week 1 rather CNX-010-49
treatment decreased the body weight gradually till week
5 and later maintained the same during complete 
treatment period.
Histological analysis of white adipose tissue revealed
an increase in adipocytes size in HFD animals compared
to that of lean control. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced adipocytes size significantly by ~30% (Figure 8C
& D). Compared to HFD control animals, CNX-010-
49 treatment enhanced non-shivering thermogenesis
(Figure 8B). We observed a significant decrease in markers
of brown fat phenotype and thermogenesis; positive 
regulatory domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and uncoupling 
protein 1 (UCP1) in HFD control adipocytes. CNX-010-49
Page 10 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
treatment restored both PRDM16 and UCP1 protein 
expression thus shown a potential to enhance brown fat
phenotype and thermogenesis (Figure 8C).
Serum leptin levels were elevated in HFD control 
animals compared to lean control (43 ng/ml vs 1.24 ng/ml).
Treatment with CNX-010-49 reduced serum leptin levels
significantly by ~50% (22 ng/ml vs 43 ng/ml) (Figure 8E)
in comparison with the HFD control animals.
CNX-010-49 has a potential reduce markers associated
with cardio vascular risks
Serum IL6 and PAI-1 levels (markers that are involved
in stress and cardio protection) in HFD control animals
were elevated significantly by 3 fold (161 pg/ml vs
50 pg/ml) and 3.5 fold (375 ng/ml vs 94 ng/ml) 
respectively compared to lean controls. Also we observed a 
nonsignificant decrease (~30%) in serum Fetuin-A levels in
HFD control animals compared to lean controls. 
Treatment with CNX-010-49 decreased serum IL6 and PAI-1
levels significantly by ~75% (34 pg/ml vs 161 pg/ml)
and ~60% (148 ng/ml vs 375 ng/ml) in comparison with
HFD control animals. CNX-010-49 treatment increased
serum Fetuin levels as compared to HFD control (3.2 ng/ml
vs 1.2 ng/ml) (Figure 9A-C).
Discussion
It is evident from multiple studies that glucocorticoids
excess plays an important role in the development of
metabolic syndrome, in particular T2DM [13]. Also it is
confirmed from many recent studies that tissue specific
glucocorticoids are involved in obesity and insulin 
resistance against the circulatory glucocorticoids [35-37].
The effect seen in these studies is an evidence to
strengthen the understanding that tissue specific 
glucocorticoids play a major role in controlling metabolic 
syndrome. The pathology observed was not restricted to a
particular tissue rather from multiple tissues. The 
therapeutic potential will be appreciated when we restrict/re-
duce the tissue level cortisol, an active glucocorticoid in
multiple tissues.
In the present study, we have used a highly potent and
selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor CNX-010-49 to study the
multiple aspects of the metabolic dysregulations as seen
in the metabolic syndrome in DIO mice on HFD. 
CNX-010-49 is an orally dosable small molecule inhibitor of
11β-HSD1 which has a half-life of 7 h. It has shown a
good tissue distribution and 11β-HSD1inhbition in 
multiple tissues like liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.
We did not observe brain 11β-HSD1 inhibition with
CNX-010-49 indicating there is no safety concerns in
Page 11 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis)
activation [38]. Since several previous studies from both
T2DM humans and rodents have demonstrated elevated
tissue specific glucocorticoids [13,18-20], we did not
measure the tissue cortisol levels in our study.
Gluconeogenesis is one of the basic features of 
hepatocytes. Abnormal gluconeogenesis will lead to both 
fasting and non-fasting glucose release in patients with type
2 diabetes. It is well established that 11β-HSD1 controls
key gluconeogenic genes PEPCK and G6PC expression
[39,40]. Our data clearly demonstrate that inhibition of
hepatic 11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 suppress hepatic 
glucose output significantly along with reduced expression
of PEPCK and G6PC in cultured mouse hepatocytes.
DIO mice have shown a significant increase in fasting
glucose which was inhibited by treatment with 
CNX-010-49. When challenged with pyruvate, CNX-010-49
treated animals had shown a reduction in glucose levels
indicating reduced gluconeogenic state of liver. These
data from both in vitro and in vivo clearly demonstrate
the role of 11β-HSD1 in hyperglycemia and inhibition
can give a potential benefit in controlling both fasting
and non-fasting hyperglycemia.
Glucocorticoid excess is known to induce insulin 
resistance in skeletal muscle. This has a significant effect
on the glucose clearance in the periphery. It has been
shown that activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 in 
skeletal muscle has a significant impact on muscle insulin
resistance [23]. Also recent studies have shown that 
insulin resistance can accelerate muscle protein degradation
by activating ubiquitin-proteasome system [41]. 
Glucocorticoids are known to increase PDK4 [42,43] and TRIM63
(an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase also known as MuRF1) in
skeletal muscle cells [44]. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced hyperinsulinemia (both fasting and fed plasma 
insulin levels) and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity as
evident from improved insulin tolerance test which was
further supported by reduced glucose intolerance. This
improvement in insulin sensitivity was further supported
by reduced phospho-JNK and phospho-eIF2α levels in
skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of treated animals 
respectively. Treatment with CNX-010-49 reduced both
PDK4 and TRIM63 expression along with restoration of
mitochondrial copy number both in vitro and in vivo. In
adipose tissue, treatment with CNX-010-49 inhibited 
lipolysis. Collectively these data suggests an overall 
improvement in the insulin sensitivity in the periphery.
Elevated tissue specific glucocorticoids are known to
cause dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. They increase
circulating triglyceride levels, hepatic de novo TAG
synthesis and storage [45,46]. Elevated CD36 expression
is known to increase hepatic triglyceride storage and
Page 12 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
secretion [47]. Serum TG levels were very high in the
HFD control mice. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced serum TG significantly indicating the role of 11β-
HSD1 in dyslipidemia. A non-significant reduction in
hepatic triglyceride content was observed with 
CNX-010-49 treatment along with decreased CD36 expression
indicating that reduced serum TG is not because of 
accumulation in liver. We also observed a significant 
increase in PPARα expression in liver indicating treatment
might have increased fatty acid oxidation. It is reported
in the literature that activation of PPARα reduces 11β-
HSD1 expression and activity in liver [48].
The role of 11β-HSD1 in obesity is well established
both by pharmacological interventions and also by 
knockout studies [28,30,32,49,50]. In agreement with the 
previous reports, we observed a significant decrease in body
weight with CNX-010-49 treatment without altering the
feed consumption rate (data not shown). CNX-010-49
treatment has reduced both adipocyte size and serum 
leptin levels significantly. Glucocorticoids are known to
decrease non-shivering thermogenesis and favors lipid
storage in adipose tissue along with significant decrease in
UCP1 expression [51]. Recently it has been shown that
PRDM16 induces brown fat phenotype in white adipose
tissue [52]. Also it induces many other genes including
UCP1 which are directly involved in uncoupled cellular
respiration and energy expenditure [53]. Treatment with
Page 13 of 15
CNX-010-49 restores the expression of both PRDM16
and UCP1 in white adipose tissue. The relation between
glucocorticoids and PRDM16 is still needs to be
established.
Vascular calcification is known to be associated with
cardiovascular disease. Recently it has been shown that
serum Fetuin-A inhibits calcification [54,55]. 
Dexamethasone has been shown to suppress the expression
of genes that inhibit calcification [56]. Elevated plasma
levels of PAI-1 are known to associate with 
athero-thrombosis and insulin resistance [57]. Glucocorticoids
are known to increase the production of PAI-1 from 
adipose tissue [58]. Systemic chronic inflammation is a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease where IL-6 act as 
central regulator [59]. CNX-010-49 treatment increased the
serum Fetuin-A levels and decreased PAI-1 and IL-6
levels significantly indicating a potential cardiovascular
benefit.
Conclusions
In summary, CNX-010-49 is a selective and ‘pan’ tissue
acting, orally bioavailable 11β-HSD1 inhibitor. 
Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 with CNX-010-49 has
normalized most of metabolic dysregulations like 
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia along with
body weight.

Abstract
Background: 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type1 (11β-HSD1) converts inactive glucocorticoids to active
glucocorticoids which, in excess, leads to development of the various risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.
Recent studies clearly suggest that both increased expression and activity of 11β-HSD1 in metabolically active tissues
such as liver, muscle and adipose are implicated in tissue specific dysregulation which collectively contribute to the
whole body pathology seen in metabolic syndrome. In the present study we have evaluated CNX-010-49, a highly
potent, selective and ‘pan tissue’ acting 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, for its potential to modulate multiple risk factors of
the metabolic syndrome.
Methods: Male C57B6/J mice on high fat diet (DIO mice) were orally dosed with CNX-010-49 (30 mg/kg twice
daily; n = 8) or vehicle for 10 weeks. Fasting glucose, triglycerides, glycerol, free fatty acids, body weight and feed
intake were measured at selected time points. At the end of the treatment an OGTT and subsequently organ
histology was performed. In vitro, CNX-010-49 was evaluated in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to assess impact on
adipocytes differentiation, hypertrophy and lipolysis whereas in fully differentiated C2C12 cells and in primary
mouse hepatocytes to assess the impact on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose output respectively.
Results: CNX-010-49 a highly potent and selective pan tissue acting 11β-HSD1 inhibitor (EC50 = 6 nM) significantly
inhibits glucocorticoids and isoproterenol mediated lipolysis in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, improves muscle
glucose oxidation, reduces proteolysis and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. Also a significant inhibition of
gluconeogenesis in primary mouse hepatocytes was observed. The treatment with CNX-010-49 resulted in a
significant decrease in fasting glucose, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Treatment also resulted
in a significant decrease in serum triglycerides levels and a complete inhibition of body weight gain without
affecting feed consumption. A significant reduction in the serum biomarkers like Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Fetuin-A with CNX-010-49 treatment was observed indicating a potential to modulate
processes implicated in cardiovascular benefits.

Background
Glucocorticoids (GCs) play a critical role in multiple
metabolic processes, including glucose homeostasis, 
insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Also it is well
established that elevated glucocorticoid levels is linked
with increased cardiovascular events [1]. Metabolic 
syndrome and Cushing’s syndrome have some similar 
phenotypes that include hyperglycemia, visceral obesity,
dyslipidemia and insulin resistance [2].
There are two isoforms of 11β-Hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase. 11β-HSD1 which converts the inactive 11β-keto
form (cortisone in humans and 11-dehydrocorticosterone
in rodents) to the active 11β-hydroxylated GCs (cortisol in
human and corticosterone in mice) [3]. It is expressed
primarily in GC target tissues such as liver, skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue and in the central nervous system
where it amplifies local GC action [4]. 11βHSD2 is
highly expressed in classical aldosterone-selective target
tissues, such as kidney [5] and prevents the 
inappropriate activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol.
In conditions of excess NADPH, as seen in metabolic
overload; 11β-HSD1 functions as a reductase and 
generates active cortisol while in situations of low levels of
NADPH it functions as a dehydrogenase and generates
inactive cortisone [6]. In humans, in vivo dehydrogenase
activity of 11β-HSD1 has been demonstrated [7].
Animals administered GCs show similar dysregulation
in phenotype as seen in metabolic syndrome or T2DM
where they observed increased fasting hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia and impaired β-cell response to oral 
glucose challenge. These animals have shown hepatic 
steato-sis and increased ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle [8].
In adipocytes GCs increase lipolysis and hypertrophy in
mature adipocytes [9] whereas in muscle GCs can 
increase proteolysis and insulin resistance. In another study,
infusion of GCs has also shown in addition to the above
observations hyperleptinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
significant decrease in uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 and
UCP-3 expression [10]. The loss of UCP1 expression is
shown to be attendant with decrease in non-shivering
thermogenesis [11,12].
In metabolic syndrome, the pathology is due to 
enhanced tissue level glucocorticoids [13]. Targeted 
disruption of the 11β-HSD1 leads to improvement in glucose
tolerance, improved lipid profile along with decreased 
gluconeogenic response [14]. Mice over expressing adipose
Page 2 of 15
11β-HSD1 develop visceral obesity which is further 
exacerbated by feeding high fat diet. These mice later 
developed all the phenotypes of metabolic syndrome including
hypertension [15,16].
11β-HSD1 expression and activity are significantly 
increased in both skeletal muscle and fat tissue from
obese type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients and also in
rodent models of disease suggesting a role for local 
glucocorticoids re-amplification in the development of
obesity and the metabolic syndrome [13,17-20]. Also 
increased 11β-HSD1 expression and activation in liver
and adipose has demonstrated a clear link between its
roles to T2DM as seen with glucose intolerance, 
increased insulin resistance, increased adiposity and body
weight gain [21,22]. The concomitant increase in 
glucocorticoids in adipose leads to decreased adiponectin
levels, increased TNFα and fasting glucose whereas 
hepatic overexpression increased insulinemia, LDL cholesterol
and serum glucose levels. One study established the 
association impaired insulin signaling and 11β-HSD1 
ex-pression/activity in skeletal muscle where dexamethasone
treated myotubes showed reduced IRS1 expression, 
increased Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 and reduced
downstream pSer473 Akt/PKB [23].
Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 in different
rodent models has demonstrated an improvement in
glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity as well as reduced
body weight gain [24-30]. Also 11β-HSD1 inhibition 
reduced serum triglycerides, cholesterol and frees fatty
acids levels. Importantly, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 
reduces plaque progression and aortic cholesterol 
accumulation murine model of atherosclerosis.
To date a few small molecule inhibitors of 11β-HSD1
have entered clinical studies. INCB13739 displayed 
statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and glucose in
T2DM patients where metformin monotherapy was 
inadequate [31]. MK-0916 decreased both blood pressure
and body weight with a trend to reduce waist 
circumference and had no significant effect on blood glucose [32].
So far none of these interventions provided significant
overall protection from metabolic syndrome. One can
attribute this lack efficacy of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors may
be due to potential reversibility of the 11β-HSD1 
enzymatic reaction. Selection of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors which 
inhibit reductase activity than dehydrogenase activity and
getting maximum inhibition in skeletal muscle apart
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
from adipose and liver is very important. So there is still
a need for intervention that alters 11β-HSD1 enzyme 
activity and thereby provides a significant benefit in the
management of metabolic syndrome.
Our understanding of 11β-HSD1 biology linking to
metabolic syndrome suggests that inhibition of 11β-HSD1
with highly potent compound in all the metabolically 
active tissues like adipose, skeletal muscle and liver, will 
provide a complete benefit in controlling the disease. Also we
screened and selected the compounds that have shown
more inhibition of reductase activity than dehydrogenase
activity along with good tissue distribution and inhibition
in the above mentioned tissues. In this study, we have
evaluated CNX-010-49 (MW= 408.5), a highly potent and
selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor for its potential to control
multiple facets of metabolic syndrome.

>>>section: discussion
Discussion
It is evident from multiple studies that glucocorticoids
excess plays an important role in the development of
metabolic syndrome, in particular T2DM [13]. Also it is
confirmed from many recent studies that tissue specific
glucocorticoids are involved in obesity and insulin 
resistance against the circulatory glucocorticoids [35-37].
The effect seen in these studies is an evidence to
strengthen the understanding that tissue specific 
glucocorticoids play a major role in controlling metabolic 
syndrome. The pathology observed was not restricted to a
particular tissue rather from multiple tissues. The 
therapeutic potential will be appreciated when we restrict/re-
duce the tissue level cortisol, an active glucocorticoid in
multiple tissues.
In the present study, we have used a highly potent and
selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor CNX-010-49 to study the
multiple aspects of the metabolic dysregulations as seen
in the metabolic syndrome in DIO mice on HFD. 
CNX-010-49 is an orally dosable small molecule inhibitor of
11β-HSD1 which has a half-life of 7 h. It has shown a
good tissue distribution and 11β-HSD1inhbition in 
multiple tissues like liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.
We did not observe brain 11β-HSD1 inhibition with
CNX-010-49 indicating there is no safety concerns in
Page 11 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis)
activation [38]. Since several previous studies from both
T2DM humans and rodents have demonstrated elevated
tissue specific glucocorticoids [13,18-20], we did not
measure the tissue cortisol levels in our study.
Gluconeogenesis is one of the basic features of 
hepatocytes. Abnormal gluconeogenesis will lead to both 
fasting and non-fasting glucose release in patients with type
2 diabetes. It is well established that 11β-HSD1 controls
key gluconeogenic genes PEPCK and G6PC expression
[39,40]. Our data clearly demonstrate that inhibition of
hepatic 11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 suppress hepatic 
glucose output significantly along with reduced expression
of PEPCK and G6PC in cultured mouse hepatocytes.
DIO mice have shown a significant increase in fasting
glucose which was inhibited by treatment with 
CNX-010-49. When challenged with pyruvate, CNX-010-49
treated animals had shown a reduction in glucose levels
indicating reduced gluconeogenic state of liver. These
data from both in vitro and in vivo clearly demonstrate
the role of 11β-HSD1 in hyperglycemia and inhibition
can give a potential benefit in controlling both fasting
and non-fasting hyperglycemia.
Glucocorticoid excess is known to induce insulin 
resistance in skeletal muscle. This has a significant effect
on the glucose clearance in the periphery. It has been
shown that activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 in 
skeletal muscle has a significant impact on muscle insulin
resistance [23]. Also recent studies have shown that 
insulin resistance can accelerate muscle protein degradation
by activating ubiquitin-proteasome system [41]. 
Glucocorticoids are known to increase PDK4 [42,43] and TRIM63
(an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase also known as MuRF1) in
skeletal muscle cells [44]. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced hyperinsulinemia (both fasting and fed plasma 
insulin levels) and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity as
evident from improved insulin tolerance test which was
further supported by reduced glucose intolerance. This
improvement in insulin sensitivity was further supported
by reduced phospho-JNK and phospho-eIF2α levels in
skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of treated animals 
respectively. Treatment with CNX-010-49 reduced both
PDK4 and TRIM63 expression along with restoration of
mitochondrial copy number both in vitro and in vivo. In
adipose tissue, treatment with CNX-010-49 inhibited 
lipolysis. Collectively these data suggests an overall 
improvement in the insulin sensitivity in the periphery.
Elevated tissue specific glucocorticoids are known to
cause dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. They increase
circulating triglyceride levels, hepatic de novo TAG
synthesis and storage [45,46]. Elevated CD36 expression
is known to increase hepatic triglyceride storage and
Page 12 of 15

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
secretion [47]. Serum TG levels were very high in the
HFD control mice. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced serum TG significantly indicating the role of 11β-
HSD1 in dyslipidemia. A non-significant reduction in
hepatic triglyceride content was observed with 
CNX-010-49 treatment along with decreased CD36 expression
indicating that reduced serum TG is not because of 
accumulation in liver. We also observed a significant 
increase in PPARα expression in liver indicating treatment
might have increased fatty acid oxidation. It is reported
in the literature that activation of PPARα reduces 11β-
HSD1 expression and activity in liver [48].
The role of 11β-HSD1 in obesity is well established
both by pharmacological interventions and also by 
knockout studies [28,30,32,49,50]. In agreement with the 
previous reports, we observed a significant decrease in body
weight with CNX-010-49 treatment without altering the
feed consumption rate (data not shown). CNX-010-49
treatment has reduced both adipocyte size and serum 
leptin levels significantly. Glucocorticoids are known to
decrease non-shivering thermogenesis and favors lipid
storage in adipose tissue along with significant decrease in
UCP1 expression [51]. Recently it has been shown that
PRDM16 induces brown fat phenotype in white adipose
tissue [52]. Also it induces many other genes including
UCP1 which are directly involved in uncoupled cellular
respiration and energy expenditure [53]. Treatment with
Page 13 of 15
CNX-010-49 restores the expression of both PRDM16
and UCP1 in white adipose tissue. The relation between
glucocorticoids and PRDM16 is still needs to be
established.
Vascular calcification is known to be associated with
cardiovascular disease. Recently it has been shown that
serum Fetuin-A inhibits calcification [54,55]. 
Dexamethasone has been shown to suppress the expression
of genes that inhibit calcification [56]. Elevated plasma
levels of PAI-1 are known to associate with 
athero-thrombosis and insulin resistance [57]. Glucocorticoids
are known to increase the production of PAI-1 from 
adipose tissue [58]. Systemic chronic inflammation is a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease where IL-6 act as 
central regulator [59]. CNX-010-49 treatment increased the
serum Fetuin-A levels and decreased PAI-1 and IL-6
levels significantly indicating a potential cardiovascular
benefit.

Results
CNX-010-49 is a highly potent, selective inhibitor and has
a good pharmacodynamic activity
CNX-010-49 is a highly potent 11β-HSD1 inhibitor 
towards both human and mouse isoforms with an IC50 of
6 nM and 64 nM respectively (Figure 1A & B) as 
established from cells over expressing human 11β-HSD1 in
CHO-K1 cell and fully differentiated mouse C2C12 
myotubes respectively. IC50 for CNX-010-49 in primary
human mature adipocytes is 13 nM (Figure 1C). 
CNX-010-49 inhibits reductase activity more than 
dehydrogenase activity (>100X, Figure 1D). CNX-010-49 is highly 
selective inhibitor with no inhibition up to 100 μM towards
11β-HSD2, 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD3 (Figure 1E, F & G).
In a single dose pharmacodynamic activity evaluation in
Swiss albino mice, oral administration of CNX-010-49 at
30 mg/kg inhibited 11β-HSD1 activity by 58% and 24% at
1 h and 7 h respectively in liver. In adipose, the inhibition
was 41% at 1 h and continued to be same till 7 h. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
skeletal muscle, the inhibition was ~38% at 1 h and 7 h.
At end of 24 h, there was no inhibition of 11β-HSD1
observed (data not shown). However there was no 
inhibition observed in brain (Table 1).
CNX-010-49 decreases liver gluconeogenic activity in
primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes and hence has a
potential to control fasting glucose
In the presence of gluconeogenic substrates (lactate and
pyruvate) along with signaling molecules (forskolin and
glucocorticoids), mouse hepatocytes showed a significant
increase in hepatic glucose release along with increase in
mRNA expression of both G6PC (glucose-6-phosphat-
ase, catalytic subunit) and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase) (5 and 9 fold increase respectively against
control cells) which are the key mediators of hepatic 
glucose production. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by 1 μM of
CNX-010-49 significantly reduced hepatic glucose 
release by ~45% and mRNA expression of both G6PC and
After oral administration of CNX-010-49 at 30 mg/kg (single dose) to Swiss albino mice (n = 4 per time point), pharmacodynamic activity of CNX-010-49 at different
time points was measured in liver, muscle, adipose and brain tissues ex vivo as described in Methods.

PEPCK (40% and 70% respectively) indicating a potential
of CNX-010-49 to reduce fasting glucose (Figure 2A-C).
CNX-010-49 increases muscle glucose oxidation, reduces
muscle proteolysis and increases mitochondrial biogenesis
In C2C12 myotubes, the presence of excess free fatty
acids, inflammatory cytokines and cortisone (in vitro 
disease mimicking condition); PDK4 (pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase 4) mRNA expression was increased by more
than 4 fold as compared to vehicle control. Inhibition of
11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 reduced PDK4 expression by
40% (Figure 3A). Under the similar condition, we 
observed around 2 fold increase in mRNA expression of
TRIM63 (tripartite motif containing 63; an E3 
ubiquitin-protein ligase which is known to enhance muscle 
prote-olysis) as compared to vehicle control. Treatment with
CNX-010-49 reduced the expression by 30% (Figure 3B).
Mitochondrial copy number was decreased by ~75%
under disease mimicking condition compared to vehicle

control. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by CNX-010-49 
restored the mitochondrial number (Figure 3C).
CNX-010-49 inhibits both adipocytes differentiation,
lipolysis and hypertrophy
Conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol by
11β-HSD1 favors adipogenesis. CNX-010-49 treatment
reduced the differentiation/adipogenesis capacity by 34%
as measured by accumulation of triglycerides in 
adipocytes as well as by oil red O staining (Figure 4A & B).
Both cortisone and isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis by 2
fold in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes as measured by the 
release of glycerol in the culture medium. CNX-010-49
treatment reduced adipocytes lipolysis by 25% (Figure 4C).
Excess metabolic overload and inflammation mediated
hypertrophy of adipocytes as measured by enhanced 
triglyceride accumulation, was reduced by 35% with 
CNX-010-49 treatment (Figure 4D).
CNX-010-49 reduces fasting blood glucose in DIO mice
Compared to the lean control animals the HFD control
animals exhibited a significant increase in fasting glucose
(136 ± 6 vs. 200 ± 8 mg/dl; P < 0.001) during the entire
study period, indicating development of insulin resistance
and hyperglycemia (Figure 5A). In CNX-010-49 treated
animals, fasting glucose started decreasing from week 5 of
Page 8 of 15
treatment and by the end of treatment period reached a
significant 15% reduction (170 ± 6 vs 200 ± 5 mg/dl; P <
0.01) when compared with the HFD control mice.
We evaluated the gluconeogenic state of liver before
terminations of the study by performing a pyruvate 
tolerance test where animals were challenged with 
gluconeogenic substrate pyruvate and glucose levels in serum
was measured. Compared to lean control animals, HFD
animals showed an increase in serum glucose AUC
(20736 ± 1013 vs 26511 ± 2057) upon pyruvate challenge.
When compared with HFD control animals, CNX-01-49
treatment resulted in significant decrease in glucose
AUC (26511 ± 2057 vs 22775 ± 97) amounting to a ~15%
suggesting decreased gluconeogenesis (Figure 5B).
The HFD control animals showed an ~25% and ~50%
increase in fasting glycerol and free fatty acid levels 
respectively when compared to lean control animals. 
CNX-010-49 treated animals showed ~18% and 20% (P < 0.05)
decrease in fasting glycerol and free fatty acids respectively
(Figure 5C & D). This indicates that treatment with 
CNX-010-49 modulates adipocytes physiology and reduces 
supply of pro-gluconeogenic substrates to the liver.
CNX-010-49 improves glucose tolerance in DIO mice
To examine whether glucose intolerance in HFD mice
was improved by the CNX-010-49 treatment, an oral
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
glucose tolerance test was performed at the end of the
treatment. Upon oral glucose challenge, a significant 
increase in the glucose excursion in HFD mice were 
observed when compared to lean control (AUC of 57376 ±
1382 in HFD control vs 33803 ± 1919 in lean control; P <
0.001). However CNX-010-49 treatment showed ~13%
decrease in glucose levels (49680 ± 734 in treatment vs
57376 ± 1382 in HFD control; P < 0.05) indicating the 
potential of CNX-010-49 to reduce post prandial 
hyperglycemia (Figure 6B).
CNX-010-49 reduces hyper insulinemia and improves
peripheral insulin sensitivity
In comparison with the lean control animals, HFD control
animals showed significant increase in fasting insulin
levels (0.59 ± 0.07 vs 1.94 ± 0.29 ng/ml; P < 0.001). 
Treatment with CNX-010-49 significantly lowered plasma 
insulin levels by ~40% (0.89 ± 0.11 vs 1.94 ± 0.29 ng/ml; P <
0.05) when compared with the hyperinsulinemic HFD
animals (Figure 6A). A similar trend was observed with
fed insulin. Along with reduced insulin levels, insulin
sensitivity was significantly improved in CNX-010-49
treated animals as evident from improved insulin 
tolerance test, reduced skeletal muscle phospho-JNK and
reduced subcutaneous adipose phospho-eIF2α levels
(Figure 6C, D & E). Also we observed a significant
decrease in mRNA expressions of PDK4 and TRIM63
in muscle tissue of CNX-010-49 treated animals 
indicating a possible improvement in glucose oxidation
(Figure 6F & G).
CNX-010-49 improves lipid profile in DIO mice
The effect of treatment on circulating TG levels is 
represented in Figure 7A.
In HFD control animals, the TG was increased by ~1.7
fold (210 ± 8 mg/dl; P < 0.001) when compared to lean
control (128 ± 8 mg/dl) during the study period. On the
other hand, the HFD fed animals treated with CNX-010-
49 showed ~20% reduction in TG levels (165 ± 9 mg/dl;
P < 0.001) when compared to HFD control. The decrease
in plasma TG upon CNX-010-49 treatment was 
observed from week 1 and was maintained throughout the
study period. Also CNX-010-49 treatment has shown a
non-significant reduction in the liver TG levels as 
compared to HFD control (Figure 7B).
We analyzed expression of fatty acid transporter CD36
and PPARα which is involved in fat oxidation in liver 
tissue. As expected expression of CD36 increased by ~1.5
fold and a significant decrease in PPARα in HFD animals
as compared to lean control indicating increased fat
Page 9 of 15

http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
uptake and decreased fatty acid oxidation. Treatment
with CNX-010-49 showed a decrease in CD36 and 
increased PPARα expression indicating a decreased fat 
uptake and improved fat oxidation in liver as evident from
decreased liver and serum TG levels (Figure 7C & D).
CNX-010-49 has a potential to improve thermogenesis
and reduce body weight
In the lean control animals, a gradual increase in body
weight was observed during the 10 weeks study period
(25.6 g to 28.1 g). In contrast, body weight of HFD 
control animals showed a rapid increase and recorded ~18%
increase by end of the study (34.7 g to 41 g). Treatment
with CNX-010-49 prevented the weight gain by ~20%
(Figure 8A) without any change in the feed consumption
(data not shown). We did not observe any significant 
increase in body weight from week 1 rather CNX-010-49
treatment decreased the body weight gradually till week
5 and later maintained the same during complete 
treatment period.
Histological analysis of white adipose tissue revealed
an increase in adipocytes size in HFD animals compared
to that of lean control. Treatment with CNX-010-49 
reduced adipocytes size significantly by ~30% (Figure 8C
& D). Compared to HFD control animals, CNX-010-
49 treatment enhanced non-shivering thermogenesis
(Figure 8B). We observed a significant decrease in markers
of brown fat phenotype and thermogenesis; positive 
regulatory domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and uncoupling 
protein 1 (UCP1) in HFD control adipocytes. CNX-010-49
Page 10 of 15
Anil et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology 2014, 15:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/2050-6511/15/43
treatment restored both PRDM16 and UCP1 protein 
expression thus shown a potential to enhance brown fat
phenotype and thermogenesis (Figure 8C).
Serum leptin levels were elevated in HFD control 
animals compared to lean control (43 ng/ml vs 1.24 ng/ml).
Treatment with CNX-010-49 reduced serum leptin levels
significantly by ~50% (22 ng/ml vs 43 ng/ml) (Figure 8E)
in comparison with the HFD control animals.
CNX-010-49 has a potential reduce markers associated
with cardio vascular risks
Serum IL6 and PAI-1 levels (markers that are involved
in stress and cardio protection) in HFD control animals
were elevated significantly by 3 fold (161 pg/ml vs
50 pg/ml) and 3.5 fold (375 ng/ml vs 94 ng/ml) 
respectively compared to lean controls. Also we observed a 
nonsignificant decrease (~30%) in serum Fetuin-A levels in
HFD control animals compared to lean controls. 
Treatment with CNX-010-49 decreased serum IL6 and PAI-1
levels significantly by ~75% (34 pg/ml vs 161 pg/ml)
and ~60% (148 ng/ml vs 375 ng/ml) in comparison with
HFD control animals. CNX-010-49 treatment increased
serum Fetuin levels as compared to HFD control (3.2 ng/ml
vs 1.2 ng/ml) (Figure 9A-C).
