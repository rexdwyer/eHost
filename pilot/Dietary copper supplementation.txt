mitochondrial dysfunction
as well as proinflammatory cytokines have been
suggested to contribute to reduced glucose-stimulated insulin 
secretion (GSIS) in type 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated that Cohen
diabetic sensitive (CDs) rats fed a high-sucrose, low-copper diet
(HSD) developed hyperglycemia and reduced GSIS in association
with peri-islet infiltration of fat and interleukin (IL)-1-expressing
macrophages, whereas CD resistant (CDr) rats remained 
normoglycemic on HSD. We examined: 1) the correlation between copper
concentration in the HSD and progression, prevention, and reversion
of hyperglycemia in CDs rats, 2) the relationship between activity of
the copper-dependent, respiratory-chain enzyme cytochrome c 
oxidase (COX), infiltration of fat, IL-1-expressing macrophages, and
defective GSIS in hyperglycemic CDs rats. CDs and CDr rats
were
fed HSD or copper-supplemented HSD before and during 
hyperglycemia development. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were
measured during glucose tolerance tests. Macrophage infiltration and
IL-1 expression were evaluated in pancreatic sections by 
electron-microscopy and immunostaining. COX activity was measured in
pancreatic sections and isolated islets. In CDs rats fed HSD, GSIS and
islet COX activity decreased, while blood glucose and infiltration of
fat and IL-1-expressing macrophages increased with time on HSD
(P
0.01 vs. CDr-HSD rats, all parameters, respectively). CDs rats
maintained on copper-supplemented HSD did not develop 
hyperglycemia, and in hyperglycemic CDs
rats, copper supplementation 
restored GSIS and COX activity, reversed hyperglycemia and 
infiltration of fat and IL-1-expressing macrophages (P  0.01 vs. 
hyperglycemic CDs-HSD rats, all parameters, respectively). We provide
novel evidence for a critical role of low dietary copper in diminished
GSIS of susceptible CDs rats involving the combined consequence of
reduced islet COX activity and pancreatic low-grade inflammation.

role in the development of type 2 diabetes (11, 18). Copper is
an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for 
met-alloenzymes, in particular the mitochondrial respiratory chain
enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (17, 30, 36). Proper
COX activity crucial for ATP generation couples respiratory
chain flux to physiological insulin secretion by pancreatic
-cells (17, 30, 36, 46). Copper deficiency has been shown to
be associated with an increased frequency of glucose 
intolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, hypertension, and
disturbances in lipid metabolism (33, 39, 46). In rats, copper
deficiency has been shown to induce increased lipid storage in
liver and pancreas and to cause degeneration and apoptosis of
pancreatic acinar cells (14, 24, 49), sparing the islets, ducts,
and nerves (48, 49). Restricting dietary copper combined with a
high concentration of dietary sucrose induced lipid peroxidation,
atrophy of pancreatic acinar tissue, and compromised 
mitochondrial function (14). Conversely, copper administration in mice
prior to diabetes induction by streptozotocin reduced the incidence
of diabetes, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and expression of
cytokines in mononuclear cells (43).
The Cohen diabetic rat model (5, 50, 51) comprises two
genetically derived contrasting strains. The sensitive (CDs)
strain develops postprandial hyperglycemia when fed the 
dia-betogenic low-copper high-sucrose diet (HSD) but maintains
normoglycemia on regular diet (RD); and the resistant (CDr)
strain that does not develop hyperglycemia when exposed to
HSD. Hyperglycemic CDs rats have normal fasting glucose
levels (50) without insulin resistance, but their pancreatic -cells
exhibit markedly reduced capacity to secrete insulin in response to
glucose (GSIS) (50). Furthermore, a pancreatic infiltration with
macrophages expressing the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 is
present in histologic sections and is associated with reduced GSIS.
Resistant CDr rats fed HSD remained normoglycemic and did not
exhibit these deleterious effects (50).
In this study, we studied the mechanism by which the
diabetogenic low-copper diet (HSD) induces hyperglycemia in
the genetically derived CDs rats. We examined 1) the 
correlation between copper concentration in HSD and progression,
prevention, and reversal of hyperglycemia in CDs rats and
2) the relationship between the copper-dependent, 
mitochondrial respiratory enzyme COX activity, infiltration of IL-1-
expressing macrophages, and defective GSIS in hyperglycemic
CDs rats fed HSD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Studies were performed on male CDs and CDr rats of similar initial
weight, aged 8 wk. Breeding and experimentation received approval of
the Animal Care Committee of Hebrew University Hadassah Medical
School.
Diets
A regular rat diet (RD; Teklad 2918; Harlan Laboratories, 
Indianapolis, IN) contained 15-22% soy as protein and 16 ppm copper
(50). In previous studies (5, 50), CDs rats were fed RD obtained from
Koffolk, Petach-Tikva, Israel, that contained as protein 21% skimmed
milk powder. Comparing the two different RDs, we found that CDs
rats fed either RD exhibited normoglycemia regardless of the protein
origin in the diet. The HSD (low-copper high-sucrose diet; MP
Biomedicals, Solon, OH) contained a low copper concentration (1.2
ppm), 72% sucrose, 18% vitamin-free casein, 5% salt mixture no. II
USP butter (4.5%), corn oil (0.5%), and vitamins (5, 50, 51). The
copper-supplemented HSD (HSDCu) contained HSD supplemented
with 16 ppm copper. This copper concentration is similar to that
measured in the regular rat diet.
Study Design
Three study protocols
were designed (Fig. 1).
Study protocol 1: diabetes progression. CDs and CDr
rats were fed
RD for 8 wk and switched
to HSD for periods of 10, 20, or 30 days. Of
note, this protocol is not a copper-deficient protocol, as the HSD is only
copper poor and the body copper stores were not eliminated using a
copper chelator. As previously shown, this protocol initiated 
hyperglycemia within a period of 1 mo only in CDs but not in CDr rats (5, 50, 51).
Study protocol 2: diabetes prevention. CDs- and CDr-rats were fed
RD for 8 wk and switched to HSDCu for a period of 30 days.
Study protocol 3: diabetes reversal. Hyperglycemic CDs rats were
fed HSD for 30 days and switched to HSDCu for periods of 10, 20, or
40 days. The hyperglycemia of CDs rats fed HSD for 30 days was
COPPER RESTORES -CELL AND COX FUNCTION
confirmed by a 2-h postprandial blood glucose test of200 mg/dl (5, 50,
51) before the onset of HSDCu feeding. The 40-day HSDCu group
was designed to confirm the persistence of reversal to normoglycemia.
OGTT and IVGTT
Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured during
oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance tests. Blood
glucose was measured using a glucometer (Elite, Bayer, Leverkusen,
Germany) and serum-insulin with an ELISA assay (Mercodia, 
Upp-sala, Sweden). At the different time points in the different study
protocols, the rats were killed, and the organs were removed and
processed. Pancreases were fixed, and pancreatic morphology, fat, and
macrophage infiltration as well as -cell function were evaluated.
COX activity was evaluated during diabetes progression (study 
protocol 1) and diabetes reversal (study protocol 3).
In the OGTT, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in
overnight-fasted rats in tail vein blood obtained before and after an
oral bolus administration of glucose (3.5 g/kg) (5, 50, 51). In the
IVGTT, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in 
over-night-fasted rats in blood drawn from the carotid artery before and
after intravenous glucose bolus (0.75 g/kg) administration into the
jugular vein (50). IVGTT required complicated surgery to insert
catheters into the right jugular vein and left carotid artery of 
anesthetized rats. Therefore, in study protocol 3, using a large number of
hyperglycemic CDs rats, we performed an OGTT. This was based on
our previous study (50) showing that IVGTT and OGTT exhibited
comparable phenotypes. Nevertheless, in the current study, the OGTT
phenotype was confirmed in 40-day CDs-HSDCu by IVGTT.
Collection of Tissues
Liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and pancreas were removed and weighed.
The entire pancreas was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at80°C
for insulin and TG measurement or for cryostat sections. Alternatively,
the pancreas was fixed by immersion either in buffered 4% 
paraformal-dehyde for light microscopy or in a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and
2% glutaraldehyde for ultrastructural analysis.

determined using a GPO-Trinder kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 
Nonesteri-fied fatty acids were measured in serum of overnight fasted rats using a
NEFA kit (Randox Laboratories, Crumlin, County Antrim, UK).
Immunohistochemistry and Morphological Evaluation
Immunohistochemistry used the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) or a
double immunofluorescence method to identify -cells, CD68 
macrophages, and IL-1 expression (20, 50) with the following primary
antibodies: insulin (A565; DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), CD68 
macrophages (clone ED1), and IL-1 (clone silk6; both from Serotec, Düssel-
dorf, Germany) (21, 50). Sections were examined using bright-field
illumination or fluorescence illumination with a Bx61 Olympus 
microscope. Areas of acinar cells and adipocytes were morphometrically
determined, and the proportion of adipose tissue was expressed as a
percentage of the total pancreas tissue
on the section. Macrophages and
their IL-1 expression
were quantified in eight consecutive sections of
four different areas in each animal for the different experimental groups.
Results are expressed per square millimeter of pancreatic parenchyma.
COX Activity in Freshly Isolated Islets and Pancreas Sections
COX activity
was determined spectrophotometrically (40) in 
ho-mogenates of 200-300 islets freshly isolated from CDs or CDr rats
fed for 30 days on HSD (study protocol 1) or from hyperglycemic
CDs rats fed for 20 days on HSDCu (study protocol 3). COX
activity was expressed per milligram of protein or per activity of the
mitochondrial matrix enzyme citrate synthase (CS). Histochemical
COX activity staining was performed in cryostat pancreatic sections
(11 m). COX activity was depicted by oxidative polymerization of
3,3=-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
in response to an osmiophilic reaction
product allowing the localization of COX in the mitochondria of
different organs (41). Briefly, pancreatic sections were incubated in
fresh incubation solution containing DAB and cytochrome C (type II)
in phosphate buffer (41, 42). Sections from the different groups were
stained in parallel to avoid variations in the intensity of the brown
staining. COX activity in islets was determined densitometrically and
calculated
as a percentage of COX activity in CDr rats fed 30-day
HSD, which
was taken as 100%. We analyzed 20-40 islets 
densito-metrically in each experimental group.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Ultrathin sections
were contrast-stained with saturated solutions of
lead citrate and uranyl acetate and evaluated by electron microscopy
(EM 9 S2; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) (21). Twenty islets were
analyzed in each experimental group.
Data Analysis
Data
are means  SE. Statistical significance of differences 
between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by the
Tukey test using the Sigmastat program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). A
two-tailed paired t-test was used to compare data from tests performed
on the same animal or in isolated-islets.
RESULTS
Glucose Tolerance Tests
HSD gradually induced hyperglycemia in CDs rats. In study
protocol 1 (Fig. 1), the glucoseAUC of CDs rats fed 10 days
HSD was not significantly different from the glucose area
under IVGTT curve (glucoseAUC) of CDr rats fed 10-day HSD
(Fig. 2C) or CDs rats fed RD (Fig. 2E), but maximal insulin
secretion was already reduced in CDs rats compared with CDr

rats (Fig. 2, B and D), indicating that the impairment in GSIS
in the CDs rats preceded the development of hyperglycemia.
The insulin area under the IVGTT curve (insulinAUC) markedly
decreased, whereas the glucoseAUC markedly increased in
relation to the duration on HSD (insulinAUC 19,134  1,352,
12,669  2,242, and 4,350  1,218 pmol·l1·120 min; 
gluco-seAUC 935  105, 1,400  144, and 1,500  160 mmol·l1·120
min for 10, 20, and 30 days on HSD, respectively; Fig. 2, A and
B). CDr rats fed HSD exhibited a small reduction (25%) in
insulinAUC only after 30 days on HSD (Fig. 2D), whereas 
gluco-seAUC did not significantly change with time on HSD (Fig. 2C).
Copper supplementation to the HSD (HSDCu; study 
protocol 2; Fig. 1) prevented the increase in glucoseAUC and the
decrease in insulinAUC (Fig. 2, E and F), thus eliminating the
difference in glucose and insulin tolerance curves exhibited by
CDs-HSD and CDr-HSD rats. In fact, blood glucose of CDs
rats fed HSDCu rose less than in normoglycemic CDs-RD
rats (Fig. 2E), while insulin secretion was comparable (Fig.
2F). Moreover the IVGTT curve of CDs rats fed HSDCu was
characterized by a large insulin-secretory response to glucose
followed by a prompt reduction in blood glucose concentration
(Fig. 2, E and F). HSDCu also reversed the diabetic OGTT
exhibited by hyperglycemic CDs rats (study protocol 3; Fig. 1).
After 10 days on HSDCu, hyperglycemic CDs rats exhibited
a 50% recovery of the glucoseAUC and insulinAUC (not shown).
Full reversal, i.e glucose levels and insulinAUC as found in
normoglycemic CDs rats (Fig. 2, G and H), was achieved after
20 days on HSDCu and maintained for a total of 40 days as
demonstrated by OGTT (Fig. 2, G and H) and IVGTT (Fig. 2I).
Pancreas Weight
Based on the fact that CDs rats fed 30-day HSD exhibited a
marked reduction in pancreatic weight and enhanced 
pancreatic lesions in our previous studies (50), we studied the relation
between the time of exposure to HSD and pancreatic weight
(study protocol 1; Fig. 1). A significant decrease in pancreatic
weight of CDs rats was initiated only after 20 days on HSD.
Pancreas weight was further reduced after 30 days on HSD
(Fig. 3A, P  0.05 vs. CDr-HSD Fig. 3B). After 10 days of
HSD, the pancreas weight of CDs was not significantly 
different from that of CDr-HSD (Fig. 3B) or CDs-RD (not shown).
The reduction in pancreatic weight was prevented (study 
protocol 2; Fig. 1) when the CDs rats were fed HSDCu (Fig.
3C). Thus, pancreas weight of CDs rats fed HSDCu was
comparable to that of CDr rats fed HSDCu (Fig. 3D). The
pancreas weight of hyperglycemic CDs rats fed 20-day
HSDCu (study protocol 3; Fig. 1) increased by 40% (Fig.
3E). The increased weight was maintained for 20 additional
days (hyperglycemic CDs rats fed 40-day HSDCu; Fig. 3E).
No differences were detected in the weight of liver, spleen,
heart, or kidney of rats in the different studies (not shown).
Pancreas weight of CDr rats did not change with time on HSD
or HSDCu (Fig. 3, B and D).
Immunostaining of Insulin in -Cells and IL-1 in
Macrophages
HSD gradually increased the number of macrophages infiltrating
the exocrine pancreas and the intraislet capillary system as well as the
extent of their activation (study protocol 1; Figs. 1 and 4, A and B).
After 10 days on HSD, the pancreas of CDs rats was infiltrated
E1026
with a small number of macrophages (0.6  0.2 macrophages/ macrophages/mm2, respectively (Fig. 4A), and 85% expressed
mm2), most of which (0.5  0.0 macrophages/mm2) expressed IL-1 (1.2  0.1 and 2.4  0.3, respectively; Fig. 4B). In the
IL-1. After 20 and 30 days on HSD, the number of infiltrating pancreas of CDr rats fed 30-day HSD, only a negligible
macrophages increased gradually to 1.4  0.3 and 2.8  0.3 number of macrophages (0.3  0.1 macrophages/mm2) was

through quantitative analyses. After only 10 days on HSDCu,
the number of macrophages decreased by 46% (1.8  0.3

organelles including the mitochondria in exocrine pancreas and
islets (not shown). After 20 days on HSD, the exocrine 
parenchyma of the CDs rats showed an advanced process of acinar
degeneration and fat infiltration (not shown). After 30 days on
HSD, macrophages showing ultrastructural signs of activation
(i.e., increased cytoplasmic volume; Fig. 5C) and fat (Fig. 6C)
were seen in the transition zone between exocrine and 
endocrine parenchyma. -Cells in the islet periphery exhibited
swollen mitochondria as a sign of cellular damage (Fig. 5D and

Ref. 50). The pancreas of CDr rats fed 30-day HSD did not
show any signs of lesions in either exocrine parenchyma or in
the islets (50). Feeding CDs rats 30-day HSDCu (study
protocol 2) prevented these pancreatic lesions, preserving a
normally appearing parenchyma (Fig. 5A) and intact cellular
organelles including the mitochondria in the exocrine pancreas
and in the -cells (Fig. 5B). Copper supplementation (study
protocol 3) reversed the deleterious effect seen in 
hyperglycemic CDs rats in a gradual manner depending on the time on
HSDCu. After 10 days on HSDCu, the recovery of the
exocrine parenchyma was underway, with complete restoration

in a few of the acinar lobules (Fig. 6, A and B). The full
recovery of both the exocrine parenchyma and -cells was
apparent after 20 days on HSDCu and persisted also after 40
days of HSDCu (Fig. 6, D, G, and H). Some cells in the
restored areas of the exocrine parenchyma were still smaller
compared with the controls, whereas all -cells showed 
well-preserved cellular organelles, particularly the mitochondria
(Fig. 6, E and F).
Blood NEFA Concentration and Infiltration of Adipose
Tissue in the Exocrine Pancreas
The previously reported increase in blood NEFA 
concentration and in infiltration of adipose tissue in the exocrine 
pancreas of CDs rats fed 30-day HSD (50) was also demonstrated
in the current study as a gradual increase. In CDs fed HSD
(study protocol 1, Fig. 1), the proportion of pancreatic lesions
and infiltration of adipose tissue increased in relation to time on
HSD. Pancreatic TGs increased by 11  4, 23  5, and 36
3% after 10, 20, and 30 days on HSD, respectively (P  0.05
vs. CDs-RD). Copper supplementation (study protocol 2, Fig.
2) prevented the increase in blood NEFA and pancreatic TG
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00036.2013 • www.ajpendo.org
(Fig. 3, F and G) to levels that were comparable to those
observed in CDs-RD pancreas (not shown). The proportion of
adipose tissue observed in the exocrine parenchyma of 
hyperglycemic CDs rats decreased in relation to time on HSDCu
(24  3, 18  4, and 5  1% for 10, 20, and 40 days on
HSDCu, respectively, P  0.05 vs. 30 days on HSD, study
protocol 3; Fig. 1). The pancreas of CDs-RD and 
CDr-HSDCu rats exhibited tiny amounts of TGs.
COX Activity
As copper intake seemed to be highly associated with GSIS
capacity and with the pancreatic histopathology changes 
exhibited by CDs hyperglycemic rats, we chose to study whether
there is a correlation between the diabetic phenotype in these
rats and the activity of the copper-dependent, mitochondrial
respiratory enzyme COX in -cells. Islets isolated from 
hyperglycemic CDs-HSD rats (study protocol 1), exhibiting a markedly
reduced GSIS during IVGTT (reduced insulinAUC in Fig. 7A)
demonstrated a 60% reduction in COX activity (COX 
measured in islet homogenates; Fig. 7, B and C), suggesting that
low copper induced the reduction in COX activity. Likewise,
E1030
the histochemical enzyme staining of pancreatic sections of
CDs rats fed HSD (study protocol 1) showed light-brown
staining, indicating low COX activity (Fig. 7D) compared with
dense-brown staining, indicative of high COX activity in islets
of CDr-HSD-rats (Fig. 7E). The densitometric analysis of the
histochemical enzyme staining confirmed the significantly

lower COX activity in the islets of CDs rats fed 30-day HSD
compared with the islets of CDr rats fed 30-day HSD (61.8
1.8 vs. 100.0  2.7, respectively, n  9 islets in each study
group, P 0.05; Fig. 7, E and D). Hyperglycemic CDs rats fed
20-day HSDCu (study protocol 3) shown in previous 
sections of this study to exhibit a substantial recovery of their
GSIS capacity and pancreatic exocrine damage also exhibited
a substantial recovery of their islet COX activity (Fig. 7, A-C).
Likewise, the histochemical enzyme staining of pancreatic
sections of hyperglycemic CDs rats fed 20-day HSDCu
(study protocol 3) exhibited dense-brown staining, indicative
of high COX activity (Fig. 7F), suggesting that dietary copper
supplementation may restore islet COX activity. The 
densito-metric analysis of the histochemical enzyme staining 
confirmed the significant recovery of COX activity in islets of
hyperglycemic CDs rats fed 20-day HSDCu (120.4 2.5 vs.
61.8 1.8 units in islets of hyperglycemic CDs rats, P 0.01,
n  20-40 islets per group; Fig. 7, D and F).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we analyzed the mechanisms 
underlying -cell dysfunction in genetically susceptible 
hyperglycemic CDs rats and the specific role of copper intake in this
process. We demonstrated that exposure of CDs rats to a
low-copper HSD induced a sequence of deleterious events
resulting in inhibition of GSIS. Exposure to HSD markedly
reduced the activity of the mitochondrial copper-dependent-
enzyme COX, increased lipolysis, and the peri-islet infiltration
of lipids and macrophages secreting IL-1. On the other hand,
we showed that feeding CDs rats a copper-supplemented HSD
prevented and reversed -cell dysfunction and the vicious
cycle of deleterious events.
As these deleterious events occurred exclusively in 
susceptible CDs rats and not in CDr rats fed the same diet (HSD), and
considering that GSIS is dependent on mitochondrial ATP
generation via COX (3, 29, 35), we hypothesize that 1) a latent
inherited aberration in -cell function, probably in COX 
activity, is stimulated in CDs rats following a short exposure to
low-copper HSD; 2) longer exposure to the copper-deficient
HSD leads to further reduction in COX activity, inducing the
deterioration of GSIS and causing the concurrent exocrine
pancreatic damage, increased lipolysis, pancreatic fat 
deposi-Fig. 6. Structure of exocrine parenchyma and islets of hyperglycemic rats fed

recovery of the exocrine parenchyma was in process; macrophages (asterisks
in A) were still present in the transition zone of the islets but were absent in
areas (B) in which the exocrine pancreatic parenchyma was fully recovered.
D: after 20 days of HSDCu, the exocrine pancreas of these rats exhibited full
recovery of the exocrine parenchyma with only a small reminiscence of
adipocyte tissue shown on a semithin section in the vicinity of the islets (dotted
line). In these rats, -cells in the periphery (E) and in the center (F) of the islets
were ultrastructurally well preserved. Cellular organelles, especially 
mitochondria (arrows), had a normal shape. Single macrophages (asterisk in F) still
remained, mostly in the interlobular region (G) of the exocrine parenchyma
(asterisks in G). H: in these rats, some exocrine parenchymal cells were still
decreased in size. C: in CDs rats fed 30-day HSD, a high degree of exocrine
pancreatic atrophy was demonstrated as well as a large amount of adipose
tissue in close vicinity to islets, as shown on this semithin section (dotted line).

tion, and macrophage infiltration and activation; and 3) the
combined effect of reduced COX activity and macrophage
infiltration establishes a deleterious microenvironment for 
pancreatic -cells.
The first pathological event observed in CDs rats occurring
after only 10 days on HSD was a reduction in GSIS that
preceded hyperglycemia and all other deleterious events. The
initial reduction in GSIS could therefore explain the particular
sensitivity of CDs rats to developing hyperglycemia following
longer exposure to low-copper HSD.
How may copper deficiency alter -cell function? Copper is
a necessary cofactor for several enzymes, including the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme COX (2-4, 17, 30, 36). We
therefore assumed that copper deficiency could impair islet
COX activity, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP generation,
thereby diminishing GSIS. The data presented in the current
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00036.2013 • www.ajpendo.org
study demonstrating a parallel decrease in COX activity and
GSIS in islets isolated from hyperglycemic CDs rats fed HSD
that was reversed when the rats were fed a copper-supple-
mented HSD support this assumption.
Other investigators also demonstrated a beneficial effect of
copper supplementation on streptozotocin-diabetic mice 
preventing -cell death and diabetes development (43). Copper
deficiency has been shown to reduce COX activity in cardiac
mitochondria of nondiabetic rats, associating copper 
insufficiency with disruption of mitochondrial architecture (8, 28, 32,
33, 52), impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,
and reduced mitochondrial respiration (2, 4, 19). The finding
that mitochondrial dysfunction is a factor in the development
of diabetes has been assigned higher importance in the last
decade, since mitochondrial DNA mutations in humans and
-cell-specific deletions of mitochondrial genes in animal
E1032
models have been shown to cause diabetes (35, 42, 44). It is of
interest to note that the relationship of diabetes and 
mitochondrial dysfunction has recently also been reported in 
lymphocytes of type 2 diabetic patients exhibiting reduced COX
activity, and reduced copper was observed in diabetic patients
(1, 22, 35, 46).
Copper deficiency has also been implicated in lipolysis and
fat accumulation in nonadipose tissues (7, 14, 25, 37, 45). A
copper-deficient diet containing high concentrations of simple
sugars such as sucrose and fructose has been reported to be
associated with abnormal glucose tolerance, 
hypertriglyceride-COPPER RESTORES -CELL AND COX FUNCTION
AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00036.2013 • www.ajpendo.org
mia, and pancreatic atrophy (7, 13, 14). In previous studies
performed in CDs rats, several lipogenic enzymes have been
shown to be elevated in both liver and adipocytes (6). 
Consequently, increased lipolysis could be partially due to the
marked decrease in insulin secretion, which could lead to the
high levels of NEFA in the serum and the ectopic accumulation
of TGs in nonadipose tissues, as suggested by others (23, 38)
and demonstrated in the current study.
In close association with exocrine pancreatic damage and fat
accumulation, we observed pancreatic local inflammation 
characterized by the infiltration of macrophages expressing 
exclusively IL-1 (50). During the past decade, it has become clear
that inflammation is a key feature of diabetes (9-11, 18, 31,
34). Cytokines released by both T-lymphocytes and activated
macrophages, in particular IL-1, have been implicated as
immunological effector molecules in the development of type
2 diabetes, reducing insulin secretion and causing -cell 
dysfunction (9, 10, 12, 18). In our study, swollen mitochondria
within the -cells in the islet periphery and the infiltrating
macrophages expressing exclusively IL-1 (50) were gradually
observed during copper deprivation (HSD diet) and prevented
or reversed to normal with copper supplementation. The extent
of the change in islet COX activity and GSIS at each period of
time during diabetes progression and reversal paralleled the
extent of pancreatic lesions and peri-islet infiltration of 
macrophages expressing IL-1. Similarly, copper supplementation
has been shown to prevent the inhibitory effect of IL-1 on
GSIS of isolated rat -cells (47). We assumed that exposure to
IL-1 alone, demonstrated in our study, has a substantial effect
on -cell function due to a particular vulnerability and 
sensitivity of the -cells
to oxidative stress (26, 27). Thus, our data
in conjunction with observations from other studies support the
assumption that the combination of reduced COX activity and
the deleterious islet microenvironment caused by IL-1 results
in the inhibition of GSIS and hyperglycemia. IL-1 can induce
the production of the free radical nitric oxide (9, 16) that may
cause endoplasmic reticulum stress and further inactivation of
COX. The question of how IL-1 originating from 
macrophages residing in the exocrine pancreas in the vicinity of the
islets and in intraislet capillaries affects -cells in the islets can
be explained based on the literature (9) and on our data (50) by
the ability of activated macrophages to affect -cell function in
a paracrine fashion (10, 12). The inflammatory element does
suggest a close functional relationship between endocrine and
exocrine pancreas, yet the exact nature of such interaction and
the way in which it may affect -cell function are important
questions to be further clarified in future studies. Overall, the
above support
a link among low-copper HSD, local 
inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced GSIS.
Finally, we propose that glucose intolerance in the CDs rat
resulted from the combined effect of genetic predisposition
exacerbated by low-copper HSD. The genetic profile protected
the CDr rat, enabling the maintenance of adequate COX
activity despite the low-copper HSD, whereas the genetic
sensitivity of CDs rats initiated the following sequence of
events (Fig. 8, A-C). After 10 days on low-copper HSD, islet
COX activity and GSIS
were reduced (Fig. 8A). Following 20
days on HSD (Fig. 8B), COX was reduced in both islets and the
exocrine tissue, inducing acinar apoptosis (50), additional 
reduction in GSIS, lipolysis, fat accumulation in the exocrine
pancreas, and peri-islet macrophage infiltration and activation.
Thirty days on HSD (Fig. 8C), GSIS is nearly abolished and
acinar apoptosis is aggravated, while peri-islet fat 
accumulation and macrophage infiltration and activation are 
substantially increased. This vicious sequence of events resulted in a
marked reduction of COX activity and complete inhibition of
GSIS and hyperglycemia.
In conclusion, our new findings demonstrate the need for
both genetic and environmental elements to cause marked
-cell dysfunction and hyperglycemia. We demonstrated
crucial-link among low dietary copper, reduced islet COX
activity, pancreatic low-grade inflammation, and diminished

GSIS. We also demonstrated the beneficial effect of copper
supplementation in preventing and restoring -cell function,
suggesting that dietary copper supplementation could hold
promising potential for a therapeutic approach.

Fig. 1. Study groups. Rats fed regular diet (RD) 
were switched to one of the following feeding 
protocols: 1) study protocol 1 (diabetes progres- 
sion): Cohen diabetic sensitive (CDs) and resistant 
(CDr) rats fed 10-, 20-, or 30-day low-copper 
high-sucrose diet (HSD; copper content 1.2 ppm); 
2) study protocol 2 (diabetes prevention): CDs and 
CDr rats fed 30-day HSD or HSDCu (HSD 
containing adequate 16 ppm copper concentration); 
3) study protocol 3 (diabetes reversal): CDs rats fed 
30-day HSD. Hyperglycemia (200 mg/dl) was 
confirmed in these rats by 2-h postprandial glucose 
test. Hyperglycemic CDs rats were fed HSDCu 
for 10, 20, and 40 days.

Fig. 3. Effect of the different dietary protocols on pancreas 
weight (A-E), blood NEFA (F), and pancreas TG concentra- 
tions (G). Study protocol 1: body weight (open bars) and 
pancreas weight (filled bars) of CDs (A), CDr rats (B) fed 10- 
(n  6), 20- (n  6), and 30- (n  6) day HSD. Study 
protocol 2: body weight (open bars) and pancreas weight 
(filled bars) of CDs (C) and CDr rats (D) fed HSD 
or 
HSDCu (n  6). Study protocol 3: E: body weight (open 
bars) and pancreas weight (filled bars) of CDs rats fed 30 
days HSD and hyperglycemic CDs-HSD rats fed 20- (n 9), 
and 40- (n  12) days HSDCu. Study protocol 2: serum 
NEFA (mmol/l; F) and pancreatic TG content (mg/g tissue; G) of 
CDs rats fed 30-day HSD (open bars, n 6), CDr rats fed 30-day 
HSD (filled bars, n 6), and CDs rats fed 30-day HSDCu (gray 
bar, n  6). Data are presented as means  SE.

Fig. 4. Effect of different dietary protocols on 
immunostaining for insulin, macrophages, 
and IL-1. A-F: immunostaining for insulin 
(green), (A, C, and E) CD68 infiltrating mac- 
rophages (red) and (B, D, and F) IL-1 in 
macrophages (orange-yellow) in pancreases 
of CDs rats fed 30-day HSD (A and B, study 
protocol 1), CDs rats fed 30-day HSDCu 
(C and D, study protocol 2), and CDr rats fed 
30-day HSDCu (E and F, study protocol 
2). A-F: counterstaining with DAPI (blue). 
Dense green insulin immunostaining was ob- 
served in the islets of rats in all groups. A: red 
immunostaining for infiltrating CD68 macro- 
phages; B: orange-yellow immunostaining 
for IL-1 expression. Macrophages were 
identified in the vicinity of the islets and in 
the pancreatic capillary system (white ar- 
rows) of CDs-HSD rats. A and B: macro- 
phages expressing both CD68 and IL-1 are 
marked in orange-yellow as an overlay of 
CD68 macrophage and IL-1 staining in 
consecutive sections. B and D: only a few 
macrophages were observed in the pancreas of 
CDs-HSDCu rats (red), and very few (or- 
ange-yellow in D) expressed IL-1. E and F: 
macrophages were not found in the pancreas of 
CDr-HSDCu rats (study protocol 2). 

Fig. 5. Effect of study protocols 1 and 2 on 
ultrastructure of the exocrine pancreas and 
-cells. Ultrastructure of the pancreas of CDs 
rats fed 30-day HSDCu (A and B, study 
protocol 2) or 30-day HSD (C and D, study 
protocol 1). A: CDs rats fed HSDCu exhib- 
ited well-preserved exocrine pancreatic pa- 
renchyma (arrowheads). B: -cell mitochon- 
dria showed normal structure (arrows in B and 
inset). Macrophages were rarely seen in the 
pancreas of these rats. Single macrophages 
found (asterisk in A), showed only mild signs 
of activation (cytoplasmic rim). C: exocrine 
pancreas of CDs-HSD rats exhibited atrophic 
parenchyma (arrowheads). Activated macro- 
phages (large cytoplasmic volume, asterisks 
in C) were observed in the transition zone 
between the islets and exocrine pancreas. In 
the islet periphery, some -cells exhibited 
swollen mitochondria (arrows in D and inset). 

Fig. 7. Effect of copper concentration in 
HSD on cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activ- 
ity in freshly isolated islets and in pancreas 
sections. A: insulinAUC of the IVGTT curve 
and COX activity normalized (B) per protein 
and (C) per CS (citrate synthase, an ubiqui- 
tous mitochondrial matrix enzyme) in freshly 
isolated islets of CDr-HSD (open bars), 
CDs-HSD (filled bars), and hyperglycemic 
CDs rats fed 20-day HSDCu (gray bars). 
Comparable data were observed for COX 
activity calculated as activity per protein (B), 
normalized per CS (C) or measured by im- 
munohistochemistry. Data are presented as 
means  SE. Brown enzyme histochemical 
staining COX activity in pancreatic cryostat 
sections of CDs-HSD (D), CDr-HSD (E), 
and hyperglycemic CDs rats (F) fed 20-day 
HSDCu. Islets are marked by dashed black 
circles. Results of densitometric measure- 
ments are expressed as gray values/m2 with 
the highest gray value of 68.4  4.3/m2 in 
CDr-HSD rats set as 100%. 

Fig. 8. Working hypothesis. A vicious se- 
quence is triggered when CDs rats are exposed 
to low-copper HSD. A: after 10-days of HSD, 
CDs rats (compared to CDr progression 10- 
day rats) exhibited a 25% reduction in GSIS 
(black arrow) resulting from COX malfunc- 
tion. At that time, the exocrine parenchyma 
was still unaffected (not shown). After 20 
days of HSD, a larger reduction in GSIS 
(larger black arrows) and acinar apoptosis 
(dark gray arrow) were observed. Copper 
also induced an excess of NEFA in the 
blood, which probably results in accumula- 
tion of peri-islet fat (light gray arrows) and 
macrophages expressing IL-1. IL-1 (gray 
flash arrow) caused the reduction in COX 
activity resulting in substantial reduction of 
GSIS and increased apoptosis of acinar cells. 
Thirty days of HSD induced a major GSIS 
reduction (larger black arrows), additional 
acinar apoptosis (larger gray arrow), peri- 
islet infiltration of adipose tissue, and further 
activation of macrophages expressing larger 
amounts of IL-1 (larger gray flash arrow). 
Consequently, GSIS was completely inhib- 
ited. M, mitochondria.
