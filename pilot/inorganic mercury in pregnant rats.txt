Abstract
Environmental toxicants such as methylmercury have been shown to negatively impact fetal
health. Despite the prevalence of inorganic mercury (Hg2+) in the environment and the ability of
methylmercury to biotransform into Hg2+, little is known about the ability of Hg2+ to cross the
placenta into fetal tissues. Therefore, it is important to understand the handing and disposition of
Hg2+ in the reproductive system. The purpose of the current study was to assess the disposition
and transport of Hg2+ in placental and fetal tissues, and to test the hypothesis that acute renal
injury in dams can alter the accumulation of Hg2+ in fetal tissues. Pregnant Wistar rats were
injected intravenously with 0.5 or 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 6 or 48 h and the disposition of Hg2+
was measured. Accumulation of Hg2+ in the placenta was rapid and dose-dependent. Very little
Hg2+ was eliminated during the initial 48 h after exposure. When dams were exposed to the low
dose of HgCl2, fetal accumulation of Hg2+ increased between 6 h and 48 h, while at the higher
dose, accumulation was similar at each time point. Within fetal organs, the greatest concentration
of Hg2+ (nmol/g) was localized in the kidneys, followed by the liver and brain. A dose-dependent
increase in the accumulation of Hg2+ in fetal organs was observed, suggesting that continued
maternal exposure may lead to increased fetal exposure. Taken together, these data indicate that
Hg2+ is capable of crossing the placenta and gaining access to fetal organs in a dose-dependent
manner.

1. Introduction
There is significant risk of humans being exposed to inorganic (Hg2+) and/or methylmercury
(CH3Hg+) through environmental, occupational or dietary means. Exposure to Hg2+ and
CH3Hg+ can lead to serious toxicological consequences in the renal, hepatic, cardiovascular,
reproductive, and nervous systems (ATSDR, 2008; Bridges and Zalups, 2010). Of particular

concern is the effect of mercuric species on the reproductive system and the developing
fetus. Despite guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), certain
populations of pregnant women continue to consume more than the recommended amount
of seafood (Nair et al., 2014; Soon et al., 2014; Xu and Newman, 2014). Interestingly, the
content of CH3Hg+ in certain species of fish is increasing (Drevnick et al., 2015), which
further increases the risk of mercury (Hg) exposure in fish-eating human populations.
Numerous studies have shown that following ingestion of CH3Hg+, mercuric ions can
readily cross the placenta and accumulate in the fetus (Bridges et al., 2009, 2012; Sakamoto
et al., 2013; Yorifuji et al., 2009). In contrast, little is known about the ability of Hg2+ to
cross the placenta despite evidence that CH3Hg+ can be biotransformed to Hg2+, either in
plasma or target cells (Lorscheider et al., 1995; Norseth and Clarkson, 1970a; Norseth and
Clarkson, 1971). It has been suggested indirectly that Hg2+ is unable to gain access to fetal
tissues even though Hg2+ has been shown to accumulate in the placenta (Ask et al., 2002;
Chehimi et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2004; Oliveira et al., 2012; Yang et al., 1996; Yoshida,
2002). Considering the placental accumulation of Hg2+, it seems possible that Hg2+ may
also gain access to fetal tissues and organs. Therefore, one aim of the current study was to
determine the nature and pattern of accumulation and disposition of Hg2+ in placental and
fetal tissues.
Given that the biotransformation of CH3Hg+−Hg2+ probably occurs primarily in maternal
blood and organs, it is important to understand how Hg2+ is handled in maternal organs, as
well those of the fetus. In adults, the primary site of Hg2+ accumulation and toxicity is the
kidney, specifically the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule (Zalups, 2000). In fact, in as
little as three hours after intravenous exposure to Hg2+ (as HgCl2), approximately 55% of
the administrated dose can be detected in the kidneys (Zalups, 1993). In animals exposed to
nephrotoxic doses of HgCl2, pathological changes such as cellular necrosis, tubular
dilatation and atrophy, proteinaceous casts, inflammation, and interstitial collagen
deposition have been identified in and around proximal tubules (Bridges et al., 2014; Favero
et al., 2014b). Increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine levels have also
been reported, which suggests that glomerular filtration rate (e.g., renal function) is reduced
following exposure to highly nephrotoxic doses of HgCl2 (Bridges et al., 2014; Zalups et al.,
2014). When maternal exposure to HgCl2 is great enough to cause reductions in renal
function, it is possible that the maternal burden and corporal disposition of Hg2+ is altered
because of a reduced ability to eliminate mercuric ions in urine. Consequently, it is possible
that the placental and fetal burden of Hg will also be altered, leading to greater toxicological
consequences in the fetus. Therefore, a second aim of this study was to test the hypothesis
that acute renal injury in pregnant dams alters the fetal accumulation of Hg2+.
In the present study, we exposed pregnant Wistar rats to either a non-nephrotoxic or a
nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 and assessed the disposition and toxicity of mercuric ions not
only in placental tissues, but also in fetal organs, either six or 48 h after exposure to Hg2+.
Understanding how mercuric ions accumulate in the placenta and fetus will provide insight
into the toxicity and the mechanisms by which mercuric ions are handled fetuses.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Page 3
Male and female Wistar rats were obtained from our breeding colony housed in the Mercer
University School of Medicine animal facility. Female Wistar rats, weighing 275-300 g,
were mated with male Wistar rats in our facility for 36 h in order to obtain pregnant dams.
All animals were provided a commercial laboratory diet (Tekland 6% rat diet, Harlan
Laboratories) and water ad libitum throughout all aspects of experimentation. The animal
protocol for the current study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Animals were handled in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted by the National Institutes of Health.
2.2. Exposure of animals to HgCl2
Four groups of pregnant dams were injected intravenously with HgCl2. Dams in Group A
were injected intravenously (i.v.) with a non-nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 (0.5 μmol kg−12 mL
0.9% NaCl containing 1 μCi of [203Hg2+] per rat) (Zalups, 1997) while dams in Group B
were injected with a nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 (2.5 μmol kg−1 2 mL saline containing 1
μCi of [203Hg2+] per rat) (Zalups et al., 1991). Groups A and B were injected with HgCl2 on
day 20 of gestation (ED20) and were euthanized 6 h later in order to assess the disposition of
Hg2+ prior to or near the time of the induction of renal injury. Dams in Group C were
injected intravenously (i.v.) with a non-nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 (0.5 μmol kg−1 2 mL
0.9% NaCl containing 1 μCi of [203Hg2+] per rat) while dams in Group D were injected with
a nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 (2.5 μmol kg−1 2 mL saline containing 1
μCiof[203Hg2+]perrat). Rats in groups C and D were injected on ED18 and were euthanized
on ED 20 in order to assess the disposition of Hg2+ in dams with acute nephrotoxic injury.
There were no obvious physiological or pathological changes in any of the rats at the time of
injection.
At the time of injection, each animal was anesthetized with 2-5% isoflurane and a small
incision was made in the skin in the midventral region of the thigh to expose the femoral
vein and artery. The dose of HgCl2 was administered into the femoral vein and then the
wound was closed with two 9-mm wound clips. Subsequently, all animals were housed
individually in plastic metabolic cages.
2.3. Radioactive Hg [203Hg2+]
Radioactive Hg [203Hg2+] was produced by neutron activation of mercuric oxide (enriched
with Hg202) at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) facility as described
previously (Belanger et al., 2001; Bridges et al., 2004). Briefly, a 3-mg sample of mercuric
oxide was irradiated for 4 weeks at MURR. Following irradiation, the sample was dissolved
in 1 mL of 1 N HCl and the activity was measured using a Fluka ion chamber. The specific
activities ranged from 10 to 15mCi/mg.
2.4. Collection of tissues and organs
At the time of euthanasia, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
ketamine and xylazine (70/30 mg kg−1 in 2mL saline). A 3-mL sample of blood was first

obtained from the inferior vena cava and 1 mL was placed in a polystyrene tube for
estimation of [203Hg2+] content. Approximately 0.5 mL of blood was placed in a blood
separation tube in order to separate plasma from the cellular contents of blood. Total blood
volume was estimated to be 6% of body weight (Lee and Blaufox, 1985).
Right and left kidneys were then removed and each kidney was trimmed of fat and fascia,
weighed, and cut in half along the mid-traverse plane. One-half of the right kidney was
placed in fixative (40% formaldehyde, 50% glutaraldehyde in 96.7 mM NaH2PO4 and 67.5
mM NaOH) in preparation for histological analyses. The remaining half was frozen in liquid
nitrogen for future RNA analyses. A 3-mm transverse slice of the left kidney was utilized to
obtain samples of cortex, outer stripe of outer medulla (OSOM), inner stripe of outer
medulla (ISOM) and inner medulla. Each zone of the kidney was weighed and placed in a
separate polystyrene tube for estimation of [203Hg2+] content. The liver was then excised,
weighed, and a 1-g section was removed for determination of [203Hg2+] content.
In groups A and B, urine and feces were collected 6 h after injection with HgCl2. In groups
C and D, urine and feces were collected for 24-h periods with the first collection taking
place 24 h after the injection with HgCl2. The second 24-h collection occurred 48 h after the
injection with HgCl2. For all groups, urine from each animal was mixed and a 1-mL sample
was weighed and placed in a polystyrene tube for estimation of [203Hg2+] content. All of the
feces excreted by each animal during each collection period were counted to determine
accurately the total fecal content of [203Hg2+]. The content of [203Hg2+] in each sample was
determined by counting in a Wallac Wizard 3 automatic gamma counter (PerkinElmer).
2.5. Collection of amniotic fluid, placentas, and fetuses
The uterus of each pregnant rat was removed and each fetus and placenta was extracted.
Each placenta was weighed and placed in a polystyrene tube for estimation of [203Hg2+]
content. Amniotic fluid was collected on a piece of Whatman paper which was placed in a
polystyrene tube. Each fetus was weighed, decapitated, and placed in 5mL of 80% ethanol
(w/v) in a glass scintillation vial. After the entire fetus was counted, the brain, kidneys and
liver of each fetus were removed. Each organ was weighed and placed in a separate
polystyrene tube. The content of [203Hg2+] in each sample was determined by counting in a
Wallac Wizard 3 automatic gamma counter. The amount of Hg in each sample was
estimated using standard computational methods.
2.6. Measurement of plasma creatinine
For determination of plasma creatinine, 30 μL of plasma was utilized and the concentration
of creatinine was assessed using the QuantiChrome creatinine assay (BioAssay).
2.7. Real-time PCR
Analysis of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) was performed with an ABI Prism 7000
Detection System as described previously (Bridges et al., 2014). A Gene Expression Assay
was utilized to detect Kim-1 (Kim-1: Rn00597701_m1) in samples. Glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh; Rn01775763_g1) was used as a reference gene.

exposure than after 48 h. At both exposure periods, the hepatic burden of Hg2+ of fetuses
from dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 was significantly greater than that of fetuses
harvested from corresponding dams exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose.
The amount of Hg2+ in the brain (Fig. 2C) of fetuses from dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1
HgCl2 for 6 h was not significantly different from that of fetuses from dams exposed to the
same dose for 48 h. In contrast, the burden of Hg2+ in fetal brains from dams exposed to 2.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 6 h was significantly greater than that from corresponding dams
exposed for 48 h. The burden of Hg2+ in fetal brain was significantly greater in dams
exposed to the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose of HgCl2 than in dams exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1
dose. This was true at both periods of study.
3.5. Disposition of Hg2+ in maternal tissues
3.5.1. Content of Hg2+ in uterus, placenta, and amniotic fluid-In dams exposed
to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the uterine burden (Fig. 3A) of Hg2+ was significantly lower after
48 h than after 6h. Similarly, the uterine content of Hg2+ in the dams exposed to 2.5 μmol
kg−1 HgCl2 was significantly greater 6 h after exposure to HgCl2 than after 48 h after
exposure. The uterine burden of Hg2+ was significantly greater in dams exposed to 2.5 μmol
kg−1 HgCl2 than in corresponding dams exposed to the 0.5 μmol kg−1 dose at both, 6 h and
48 h after exposure to HgCl2.
The total placental burden of Hg2+ per dam is shown in Fig. 3B. In dams exposed to 0.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the placental burden of Hg2+ was significantly greater 6 h after exposure
than after 48 h. A similar pattern was observed when dams were exposed to the 2.5-μmol
kg−1 dose of HgCl2. As might be expected, the burden of Hg2+ was significantly greater in
placentas from dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 than in placentas from corresponding
dams exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose, at both exposure times.
The amount of Hg2+ in the total volume of amniotic fluid per dam is shown in Fig. 3C. In
dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the amount of Hg2+ in the amniotic fluid was
significantly greater after 6 h of exposure than after 48 h. Similarly, when dams were
exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the content of Hg2+ in amniotic fluid was greater after 6 h
than after 48 h. The content of Hg2+ in amniotic fluid was greater in dams exposed to 2.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2 than in corresponding dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 after 6 h and 48 h.
3.6. Content of Hg2+ in the total renal mass and urine of dams
The burden of Hg2+ in the total renal mass of dams exposed to HgCl2 is shown in Fig. 4A.
The majority of the administered dose was detected in maternal kidneys. When dams were
exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the renal burden of Hg2+ 6 h after exposure was not
significantly different from that 48 h after exposure. In dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1
HgCl2, the renal burden of Hg2+ was significantly greater 6 h after exposure than after 48 h.
The renal burden of Hg2+ of dams exposed to 2.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1 for either 6 h or 48 h
was significantly greater than that of corresponding dams exposed to 0.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1.

The amount of Hg2+ excreted in urine of dams is shown in Fig. 4B. The 24-h collection
represents the initial 24 h after injection with HgCl2 while the 48-h collection represents the
second 24-h after injection with HgCl2. When dams were exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2,
the urinary excretion of Hg2+ after 6 h of exposure was significantly lower than that detected
in the 24-h and 48-h collections. A similar pattern of urinary excretion of Hg2+ was
observed in dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2. The amount of Hg2+ excreted in urine
by the dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 was significantly greater than that excreted by
the corresponding rats exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose at each time measured after
exposure to HgCl2.
3.7. Concentration of Hg2+ in renal zones
The concentration of Hg2+ detected in the renal cortex (nmol g−1; Fig. 5A) 6 h after
exposure of dams to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 was not significantly different from that detected
48 h after exposure. In contrast, the concentration of Hg2+ in the renal cortex of dams 6 h
after exposure to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 was significantly greater than that in the cortex of
corresponding dams 48 h after exposure. The cortical concentration of Hg2+ was
significantly greater in dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 than in dams exposed to 0.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2 after either 6 h or 48 h.
The concentration of Hg2+ detected in the OSOM (nmol g−1; Fig. 5B) 6 h after dams were
exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 was significantly lower from that detected 48 h after
exposure. The concentration of Hg in the OSOM of dams 6 h after exposure to the 2.5-μmol
kg−1 dose was significantly greater than that in the OSOM of corresponding dams 48 h after
exposure. The concentration of Hg2+ in the OSOM of dams exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2
was significantly greater than that of dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 for either exposure
period. The amount of Hg2+ detected in the ISOM and the inner medulla was minimal (data
not shown).
3.8. Content of Hg2+ in liver and feces
The hepatic burden of Hg2+ of dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1− HgCl2 was significantly
greater after 6 h of exposure than after 48 h (Fig. 6A). A similar pattern of accumulation was
observed in dams that were exposed to the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose. When dams were exposed to
2.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1, the hepatic burden of Hg2+ was significantly greater than that in
corresponding dams exposed to 0.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1 at both 6 h and 48 h after exposure.
The amount of Hg2+ excreted in feces by dams is shown in Fig. 6B. The 24-h collection
represents the initial 24 h after injection with HgCl2 while the 48-h collection represents the
second 24-h after injection with HgCl2. It should be noted that the fecal mass varied among
rats. The amount of Hg2+ excreted in feces by dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 6 h
was significantly lower than that excreted in either of the 24-h periods of the 48-exposure to
HgCl2. A similar pattern of fecal excretion was observed in dams exposed to the 2.5-μmol
kg−1 dose of HgCl2. There was no significant difference in the fecal excretion of Hg2+
between rats exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 and rats exposed to 2.5-μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for
6 h. Moreover, the fecal excretion of Hg2+ during the first 24-h period of the 48-h exposure
period was not significantly different between dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 and

those exposed to the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose. However, during the second 24-h period of the 
48-h exposure period, the fecal excretion of Hg2+ was significantly greater in dams exposed to
the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose than in dams exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose.
The hematologic burden of Hg2+ in dams exposed to either dose of HgCl2 was significantly
greater after 6 h of exposure than after 48 h (Fig. 7A). Exposure of dams to 2.5 μmol HgCl2
kg−1 resulted in a hematologic burden of Hg2+ that was significantly greater than that in
corresponding dams exposed to 0.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1 at 6 h and 48 h.
The amount of Hg2+ detected in the brain of dams was low but detectable (Fig. 7B). In dams
exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the burden of Hg2+ in the brain was not significantly
different between dams exposed for 6 h and those exposed for 48 h. In dams exposed to 2.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the amount of Hg2+ in brain was significantly greater after 6 h of
exposure than after 48 h.
3.10. Assessment of Hg2+-induced nephropathy
Real-time PCR analyses (Fig. 8) were performed in order to evaluate the expression of
Kim-1, a biomarker of renal injury, in kidneys of dams exposed to 0.5 or 2.5 μmol kg−1
HgCl2. The expression of Kim-1 was significantly greater in kidneys of dams exposed to
either dose of HgCl2 for 48 h than in kidneys of corresponding dams exposed for 6 h. The
expression of Kim-1 was significantly greater in kidneys isolated from dams exposed to 2.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2 than in kidneys from corresponding dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1
HgCl2. This observation was true for both exposure periods.
Analyses of plasma creatinine levels (Table 2) support the results of the PCR analyses.
Samples of plasma, collected from dams 6 or 48 h after injection with either dose of HgCl2,
were utilized for analysis of plasma creatinine. In dams exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2,
plasma creatinine levels were similar to that reported previously for normal Wistar rats
(Amini et al., 2012; Bridges et al., 2014; Moeini et al., 2013; Palm and Lundblad, 2005).
Exposure of dams to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 48 h led to plasma creatinine levels that were
significantly greater than those measured after exposure to the same dose of HgCl2 for 6h.
Furthermore, exposure of dams to either dose of HgCl2 for 48 h resulted in levels of plasma
creatinine that were significantly greater than that detected after 6 h of exposure.
Fig. 9 shows the histological features of kidneys from dams exposed to 0.5 μmol or 2.5 μmol
kg−1 HgCl2 for 48 h. No histological alterations were observed in kidneys from dams
exposed to either dose of Hg2+ for 6 h (data not shown). In kidneys of dams exposed to 0.5
μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the renal structures in the cortex (Fig. 9A) and OSOM (Fig. 9B) appeared
normal. Similarly, in kidneys of dams exposed to the 2.5-μmol dose of HgCl2, significant
pathological alterations were not observed in the cortex (Fig. 9C). However, the OSOM
(Fig. 9D) exhibited significant cellular injury and necrosis throughout, particularly at the
cortico-medullary junction. Approximately 50% of proximal tubules located in the OSOM
displayed signs of complete tubular necrosis, which is characterized by eosinophilic
cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, and death and shedding of epithelial cells. Tubular lumens were
filled with proteinaceous material and numerous leukocytes were present in the interstitial

4. Discussion
A strong body of scientific evidence indicates that CH3Hg+ can cross the placental barrier
and compromise fetal health (ATSDR, 2008; Bridges et al., 2009, 2012; Castoldi et al.,
2001; Chehimi et al., 2012; Clarkson et al., 2003; Myers et al., 2000). However, little is
known about the ability of Hg2+ to cross the placenta. Since CH3Hg+ can be biotransformed
to Hg2+ within biological systems (Daniel, 1972; Gage, 1964; Norseth and Clarkson,
1970a,b), it is important to understand how Hg2+ is handled by placental and fetal tissues.
Therefore, the principal aims of the current study were to (1) test the hypothesis that Hg2+
can accumulate in the placenta and fetus following maternal exposure to HgCl2 and (2) to
test the hypothesis that maternal exposure to a nephrotoxic dose of HgCl2 alters the maternal
and fetal disposition of Hg2+. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the
disposition of Hg2+ in fetal tissues following maternal exposure to a nephrotoxic or 
non-nephrotoxic dose of Hg2+.
The findings of the current study provide important insight into the handling of Hg2+ in
placental and fetal tissues. Following exposure to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the placental burden
of Hg2+ 6 h after exposure was similar to that 48 h after exposure. This finding suggests that
(1) placental accumulation of Hg2+ is rapid and (2) the placenta does not have efficient
mechanisms to eliminate mercuric ions. In addition, the placental accumulation of Hg2+
appeared to be directly dependent upon the dose of HgCl2 to which dams were exposed
(e.g., a higher dose led to increased accumulation). Hg2+ has been shown previously to be
retained in the placenta (Ask et al., 2002), which may be due, in part, to the binding of Hg2+
in blood to the endothelium of placental blood vessels. The present data, however, indicate
that at least a fraction of the Hg2+ that gains access to the placenta subsequently enters fetal
tissues. The Hg2+ that is transported into fetal tissues likely exists as a conjugate of a 
thiol-containing biomolecule (Bridges et al., 2009; Bridges and Zalups, 2010), which may utilize
a number of various transport proteins to cross the placenta and access fetal organs/tissues.
When the fetal burden of Hg2+ was examined in dams exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose of
HgCl2, the total fetal accumulation of Hg2+ was greater 48 h after exposure than 6 h after
exposure. This finding suggests that fetal accumulation of Hg2+ continues to increase during
Page 9
space. In addition, about 25% of proximal tubules displayed the initial stages of cellular
necrosis, which are characterized by swelling and blebbing of epithelial cells and
condensation of nuclear chromatin. This pattern of injury is similar to that reported
previously for HgCl2-induced nephrotoxicity.
the initial 48 h after exposure to HgCl2. Interestingly, when dams were exposed to the higher
dose of HgCl2, there was no difference in fetal burden between 6-h and 48-h of exposure.
This lack of difference may be due to saturation of transport mechanisms involved in the
transplacental movement and fetal accumulation of Hg2+. Collectively, these findings tend
to suggest that even acute exposure to HgCl2 can lead to measureable accumulation of Hg2+
in fetal tissues. Furthermore, regular and/or continuous exposure of pregnant women to
mercuric compounds, either through environmental or dietary exposure, may lead to
significant exposure of the fetus to Hg2+. It should also be noted that fetal organs,
particularly the brain, may be more susceptible to low-level exposure to Hg. Indeed,

induced fetal neurotoxicity has been reported at doses that did not result in toxicological
consequences in the mother (Grandjean and Herz, 2011; Karagas et al., 2012).
To our knowledge, the current findings represent the first report of the distribution of
mercuric ions in fetal organs following maternal exposure to Hg2+. Among fetal organs, the
total renal mass had the greatest amount of Hg2+ per gram of tissue, followed by liver and
brain. This pattern of accumulation is similar to that observed previously when dams were
exposed to methylmercury (Bridges et al., 2009, 2012). This similarity may be due to the
biotransformation of a fraction of methylmercury to Hg2+ resulting in accumulation of Hg2+
in addition to methylmercury. Since the kidney is the primary site of accumulation of Hg2+
in dams (Bridges and Zalups, 2010; Favero et al., 2014a; Zalups, 2000), it is not surprising
that it is also the primary site of accumulation in the fetus. Furthermore, these findings
indicate that accumulation of Hg2+ in fetal organs is dependent upon the dose of Hg2+
received by the dam. Previous reports also suggest that the fetal burden of Hg correlates
directly with the maternal dose and that continued maternal exposure to mercuric species
can lead to neurological deficits in fetuses (Debes et al., 2006; Karagas et al., 2012). The
inefficient elimination of Hg2+ from fetal tissues and the enhanced sensitivity of these
tissues to the effects of Hg2+ may lead to significant deleterious effects in the fetuses
without manifestation of clinical symptoms in the mother (Grandjean and Herz, 2011;
Karagas et al., 2012). Moreover, in the current study, when renal injury was evident in dams
(following exposure to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 48 h), the burden of Hg2+ in fetal organs
was decreased, possibly due to an increase in urinary excretion of Hg2+ by dams.
It should be noted that when dams were exposed to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2, the accumulation
of Hg2+ in maternal kidneys was similar 6 and 48 h after exposure. In other words, the renal
accumulation of Hg2+ was rapid and the elimination of Hg2+ from the kidney was minimal.
The rapid accumulation of Hg2+ in the kidney corresponds with previous findings indicating
that 40% of the administered dose of Hg2+ is present in the kidney within 3 h of exposure
(Zalups, 1993; Zalups and Minor, 1995). The lack of elimination is likely due to complex
intracellular binding reactions between mercuric ions and intracellular proteins and 
non-protein thiols, which consequently restricts movement of mercuric ions out of proximal
tubular cells (Barbier et al., 2005; Zalups, 2000).
When the accumulation of Hg2+ was measured in each renal zone, we discovered that the
majority of accumulation occurred in the cortex and OSOM. This pattern of renal
accumulation of Hg2+ is significant in that known carriers of Hg2+ are present in proximal
tubular segments located in the cortex and OSOM (Bridges and Zalups, 2010).
The results of the current study also show clear differences in the renal handling and
disposition of Hg2+ following the exposure of dams to a non-nephrotoxic or a nephrotoxic
dose of HgCl2. When dams were exposed to 2.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 (for either 6 h or 48 h),
we observed that the accumulation of Hg2+ in maternal kidneys was dose-dependent during
the first 6 h after exposure. In contrast, 48 h after exposure to the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose, the
renal burden of Hg2+ was only twofold greater than that after the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose. The
apparent lack of dose-dependent accumulation at the 48-h time point may be due to injury
and death of proximal tubular cells, which leads to sloughing off of these cells and their

5. Conclusion
The current study provides novel data suggesting that Hg2+, probably as a thiol S-conjugate,
is taken up by the placenta and subsequently gains access to fetal organs. In addition, we
suggest that the accumulation of Hg2+ in fetal tissues is heavily dependent upon the dose of
Page 11
contents into the tubular lumen for excretion in urine. Indeed, the amount of Hg2+ detected
in urine 48 h after exposure was significantly greater than that excreted during the first 6 h.
This excretion of Hg2+ may lead to a reduction of other pools of Hg2+, such as that in
placental and fetal tissues.
Histological analyses were performed on maternal kidneys in order to characterize the Hg2+-
induced nephropathy in kidneys of dams. Exposure of dams to 0.5 μmol kg−1 HgCl2 for 6 or
48 h did not result in detectable renal injury, which is consistent with findings from previous
studies using this dose of HgCl2 (Bridges and Zalups, 2005, 2010; Zalups, 2000). Moreover,
when dams were exposed to the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose for 6 h, no obvious pathological
alterations were observed in the kidneys. In contrast, when rats were exposed to 2.5 μmol
kg−1 HgCl2 for 48 h, areas of significant cellular injury and necrosis were evident in the
inner cortex and OSOM of the kidneys. These data correspond to our previous findings
(Bridges et al., 2014; Zalups and Diamond, 1987) and suggest that an exposure period of
longer than 6 h (at the 2.5-μmol kg−1 dose) is necessary to induce histologically
demonstrable signs of renal injury. The current analyses of plasma creatinine and the 
real-time PCR analyses of Kim-1, a biomarker of renal injury, tend to support this conclusion.
With regard to the hepatic burden of Hg2+ in dams, we found that when dams were exposed
to either dose of HgCl2, the amount of Hg2+ in the liver 48 h after exposure was
significantly lower than that 6 h after exposure. This finding suggests that a fraction of the
hepatic burden of Hg2+ is eliminated between 6 and 48 h after exposure. Indeed,
hepatobiliary elimination of Hg2+ has been shown to occur in the hours/days following
exposure (Zalups, 1995; Zalups and Koropatnick, 2000). The fecal elimination of Hg2+
increased during the 48 h following exposure to either dose of HgCl2, suggesting that
hepatic Hg2+ is eliminated in feces via the biliary tract.
The disposition of Hg2+ in blood of dams followed a pattern similar to that of the liver. In
rats that were exposed to HgCl2 for 48 h, the hematologic burden of Hg2+ (at either dose)
was significantly lower than that of rats in the corresponding 6-h groups. The reduction in
the burden of Hg2+ in blood is likely due to rapid uptake of Hg2+ by the kidneys and liver as
well as some glomerular filtration of low molecular weight thiol S-conjugates of Hg2+.
When dams were exposed to the 0.5-μmol kg−1 dose of HgCl2, the burden of Hg2+ in the
maternal brain after 6 h and 48 h was similar, suggesting that accumulation of Hg2+ in the
brain does not change between 6 h and 48 h. However, when dams were exposed to the 2.5-
μmol kg−1 dose, the burden of Hg2+ decreased slightly between 6 h and 48 h. This decrease
may be due to changes in the Hg2+ content of the blood that supplies the brain. In fact, it
should be noted that much of the Hg2+ in the brain may represent Hg2+ associated with
erythrocytes or the endothelium of blood vessels within the brain.

Histological analyses of kidneys from pregnant Wistar dams injected intravenously with 0.5  
μmol HgCl2 kg−1 2 mL or 2.5 μmol HgCl2 kg−1 2 mL. In kidneys of rats injected with 0.5  
μmol HgCl2 kg−1 2 mL, no histological alterations or pathological changes were observed in  
the cortex (A) or outer stripe of the outer medulla (B). In kidneys of rats injected with 2.5  
μmol HgCl2kg−1 2mL, the cortex (C) appeared normal; however, significant areas of  
necrosis (arrows) were evident in the outer stripe of the outer medulla (D). Bar= 100 μm.
